      "text": "\nIn the last few years, several techniques have been extensively used to study the conductance of nanometerscale contacts with variable cross sections [1][2][3][4]. Most of the previous works have been focused on metallic contacts, for which the Fermi wavelength λ F is very close to the dimensions of the atom. The elongation of the contact produces discrete changes in the cross section (i.e. in the number of atoms) resulting in abrupt jumps in the experimental G − Z curves (conductance vs. elongation of the contact). These jumps are of the order of the conductance quantum G 0 = 2e 2 /h since the addition of one atom to the contact is accompanied by the opening of one or few conduction channels depending on the metal [5]. This interplay between electronic and mechanical properties in metallic contacts [6,7] makes it difficult to observe \"pure\" quantum effects on the conductance. \n\nOn the other hand, semimetallic nanocontacts could provide a unique laboratory to investigate quantum conductance phenomena in three-dimensional wires. The high value of λ F in these systems requires large contact areas in order to have total transmissions of the order of a conductance quantum. As a consequence, it will be possible to distinguish between atomic rearrangements and quantum effects. However, earlier experimental results did not clarify the situation. The first experiments [8] on semimetallic Sb contacts showed several sharp jumps in the G − Z curves for conductances much lower than the quantum unit, proving that, indeed, many atoms are necessary in order to obtain a value of the conductance equal to G 0 . Nevertheless the conductance quantization features were absent probably due to a strong backscattering [8] or to the large angular opening [9] of the contact. More recently, conductance experiments [10] on Bi nanowires at 4K presented a very different behaviour showing, in some situations, long conductance plateaus close to integer multiples of G 0 . After statistical averaging of many consecutive curves, the histogram of conductance values showed the existence of two peaks close to G 0 and 2G 0 . However, the shape of the histogram exhibited strong deviations from those reported in metallic contacts. In order to shine some light on the physics of semimetallic contacts, we have performed scanning tun-neling microscopy (STM) experiments on Bi nanocontacts at different temperatures. First, we analyze in detail the opening of the first conduction channel, which is a particularly difficult task in metallic contacts, where the transition from the tunneling regime into contact is governed by the well known jump-to-contact phenomenon [11]. The peculiar electronic structure of bismuth [12,13] enables a selection of the carrier type, depending on the dimensions of the contact and temperature [14]. This effect will be studied at 77K and 4.2K for contacts with typical conductances in the range 0 < G < 2G 0 . The coexistence of conductance quantization effects and atomic rearrangements will be studied through conductance histograms of the G − Z curves. Due to the fact that even for low conductance values many atoms will be forming the contact, the evolution of the G − Z curves will be analyzed in terms of a simple gliding mechanism that describes the variation of the contact shape during the elongation process. \n\nThe experiments have been performed using a high stability scanning tunneling microscope (STM) which can be operated over the range 2 K -300 K inside a 4 He cryostat. We have used high-purity (99.999%) polycrystalline bismuth, cut from a rod, for both STM tip and sample. Prior to the measurements the surfaces were cut and scratched. At a given location on the sample, the tip is crashed forcibly and repeatedly into the substrate, causing extended plastic deformations that lead to a connective neck between tip and sample. Different neck geometries can be obtained by varying the indentation depth [7]. In Fig. 1 (Fig. 2 ) we show typical G − Z curves corresponding to a series of consecutive elongation cycles measured at 77K ( 4K ). Continuous cycles of elongation-contraction of a neck lead to situations in which the G − Z curve presents clear steps over the entire conductance range (typically from 0 to 10 G 0 ). Although the curves are not reproducible they show a very similar shape. Typically, the length of the steps varies between 0.2 and 1 nm, depending on the initial conditions of the elongation-contraction cycle (i.e., the neck) [15]. These values are close to the lattice parameter of Bi (0.475nm). At 77 K the conductance steps have a small positive slope without specific structure. However, at 4K the first plateaus with G > ∼ G 0 usually show smooth curved shapes which resemble those observed for metallic Al contacts [16,17]. Moreover, the conductance discontinuities ∆G are closer to G 0 , suggesting that at 4K bismuth exhibits a metallic-like behaviour, with a smaller λ F . Therefore, only a few atoms are involved in the contact. Distortions of the lattice parameter at the contact, together with the peculiar band structure of bismuth, are responsible of the curved plateaus obtained at 4 K. As expected for a semimetallic contact, in the subquantum conductance regime the G − Z curves show clear steps at both temperatures (see Figs. 1 and 2). Except for the small jump discontinuities (caused by rearrangements of the atoms and thus reflecting mechanical contact), G decreases exponentially as a function of Z like in a vacuum tunneling process, but with an effective tunneling barrier that strongly depends on temperature (see Figs. 1b and 2b). While at 77K the effective barriers are typically of the order of 10meV, those obtained at 4K are close to 1eV. When the contact finally breaks, the conductance is usually so small that, due to limitations of our current experimental setup, we are not able to observe the transition from \"contact\" tunneling to actual vacuum tunneling. All these facts indicate that, even at these very small values of the conductance, tip and sample are still in mechanical contact. At 4K there are some situations (see Fig. 2(b), and the curve on the right hand side in Fig. 2(c)), in which the contact breaks before the subquantum conductance regime. In those cases, the conductance does not display subquantum steps and decreases exponentially as a function elongation, where the effective tunneling barrier φ ≈ 4eV is very close to the expected bismuth work function. A detailed theoretical description of the electrical properties of the contact during elongation is a very difficult task. The effective mass of the charge carriers in Bi varies over a wide range from m * ≈ 0.002m 0 for light electrons to m * ≈ m 0 for heavy electrons (m 0 is the electron mass) and depends on the crystal orientation [12,13]. Moreover, the peculiar electronic properties of bismuth (semimetallic character, band filling, Fermi surface, ...) may also vary with lattice deformations due to the extreme uniaxial strains occurring in small contacts [17] during the elongation-compression processes. The apparent metallic behaviour at 4K can be qualitatively understood in terms of quantum finite size effects [18,14]: as the contact radius R decreases the quantized transversal momentum k n ∝ 1/R increases. This leads to a shift in the subband energy position [14], E n ≈ 2 /(2m * )k 2 n (larger for light carriers) and the gap between light and heavy electrons increases. At low temperatures, there is a transition from light carriers at large cross sections to predominantly heavy electron transport for small cross sections where the light electron states become empty. This qualitative discussion is fully consistent with the analysis of the tunneling regime in mechanical contact (G < G 0 ): The effective barriers in mechanical contact are related to the electron confinement in the constriction. In a free electron picture, the longitudinal momentum of each transversal mode or channel n is given by k zn = K 2 F − k 2 n (with K F = 2π/λ F ) such that to each channel n corresponds a 1D effective potential barrier in the longitudinal direction [9,19]. The modes with k n > K F = (2π/λ F ) are evanescent or tunneling modes. When R < ∼ λ F there is no room even for a single channel and the conductance is dominated by electron tunneling through the first channel with k z1 ≈ ik n ≈ iπ/R. Assuming that the constriction length increases linearly with the elongation Z we will roughly have G ∝ exp(− π R Z). Therefore, in the tunneling regime (before the contact breaks), the slope of ln G as a function of Z gives the order of magnitude of the lateral size of the constriction. Our results then suggest, that, at high temperatures, subquantum steps are related to structural changes of constrictions involving hundreds of atoms (R is a few nanometers). Since the Fermi wavelength is larger or of the order of R, it would also be of the order of a few nanometers. In contrast, at low temperatures subquantum conductance steps can be associated with changes in constrictions consisting of a few atoms (R is now a few Å). This would imply λ F to be one order of magnitude smaller than before. As mentioned above, this qualitative discussion is fully consistent with the behaviour of the G − Z curves in the range of a few conductance quanta. \n\nThe observation of subquantum steps in the G − Z curves provides evidence of atomic rearrangements in the contact. Since these curves are not exactly reproducible from cycle to cycle, conductance quantization effects are difficult to observe from a single elongation curve. After the formation of a given neck, a histogram is obtained from 200 consecutive G − Z curves. In fig. 3(a) we present a set of histograms obtained from different initial necks. As it can be seen, the histograms present peaks close to integer multiples of G which, in contrast with metallic contacts, can be unambiguously associated with conductance quantization effects. In general, we observe that the histogram shape (peak height, number of peaks, ...) changes from neck to neck [15]. This behaviour is clearly different than that observed in some metals (e.g. gold nanocontacts [4]). After averaging over 10 different necks, the resulting histogram (uppermost in Fig. 3a) still shows clear peaks at 1 and 2 conductance quanta which now resemble those of metallic contacts. However, in semimetallic contacts a variation of a few quanta in the conductance requires cross sections much larger than those in metallic ones. Therefore, the mechanical evolution in these systems is expected to be rather different than in metals. For cross sections larger than a few nanometers, yielding occurs as a consequence of collective shear events [20,21] . A qualitative picture of the mechanical evolution can be obtained from a simple model system. We shall restrict ourselves to the tensile loading regime during the elongation of the neck. Suppose that the initial constriction is represented by a cylinder of radius R 0 and consider the deformation process sketched in the inset in Fig. 4(b). The contact is assumed to glide along a symmetry plane that forms an angle θ with respect to the cylinder axis. The maximum elongation Z max before the contact breaks down, is given by Z max = 2R 0 / tan(θ). For a finite elongation Z = Z/Z max , the contact area A shrinks according to (see inset Fig. 4(b)): \n\nInterestingly, the contact loses its axial symmetry and the narrowest section of the contact resembles an elliptical cross section (Fig. 4(b)) with an axis aspect ratio η( Z) ≈ πR 2 0 (1 − Z) 2 /A. An estimation of the transmission coefficients T nm as a function contact elongation can be obtained from a simple model based on the saddlepoint-contact model [22,23]. The geometry of our contact resembles the wide-narrow-wide geometry with 'elliptical' cross section discussed in Ref. [23]. Therefore, T nm can be approximated by: \n\nwhere ǫ nm = (n + 1/2)/ √ η + √ η(m + 1/2) (all the lengths are in units of λ F ), and tan α = (A(0) − A( Z))/π/Z max defines the effective \"opening angle\" [9] of the constriction. The conductance curves are obtained from the Landauer formula, G = nm T nm . 4 together with some experimental results at 77K. In order to mimic the stepped structure, the cross section is assumed to be constant within a lattice parameter of Bi. Experimentally the conductance changes from ≈ 10G 0 to G 0 after an elongation of the contact of the order of 15 nm. Within our model this fixes the Fermi wavelength to be in the nanometer scale, in agreement with the analysis of the subquantum regime. For small Z, i.e. for small opening angles, there is almost no scattering (the T nm 's are 0 or 1). Therefore, the conductance is simply given by the number of propagating channels in the initial contact N 0 , i.e., those nm channels having ǫ nm < √ πA. As the elongation proceeds an interesting interplay between the narrowing of the constriction and the change of degeneracy of transversal modes can be observed. For Z = 0 the contact has cylindrical symmetry and the transversal levels exhibit the well known degeneracy of a parabolic confining potential. Depending on the initial contact cross section, the conductance is then given by 1, 3, 6, 10, . . . G 0 . As Z increases, the cross section decreases and, at the same time, the degree of anisotropy η( Z) also varies, removing the mentioned degeneracy. The conductance behaviour along the elongation path depends critically on the initial conditions of the contact. The theoretical histograms (Fig. 3(b)) strongly depend on the initial cross section and exhibit an overall shape that is very similar to the experimental one. \n\nIn summary, the above experiments provide direct experimental evidence for the presence of conductance quantization in three-dimensional nanocontacts, as well as an experimental exploration of the conductance regime prior to the opening of the first quantum channel. Our results for moderate-sized contacts are well described by a simple model of contact evolution during an elongation process that is based on a gliding mechanism. In agreement with magnetotransport measurements, the differences observed between 77K and 4K curves for G < ∼ G 0 are consistent with a transition from light to heavy electrons at the Fermi level when the contact cross section becomes sufficiently small. Finally, we consider that our work opens a new way to perform experiments on quantum coherence phenomena in atomic scale contacts that up to now were doable with semiconducting heterostructures only. \n\nThis research was supported by the DGICyT (Spain) through grants BFM2000-1470-C02-02, PB98-0464 and PB97-0068. \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n      \n",

      "text": "\nIntroduction\n\nComposite materials have shown distinct characteristics in term of strength and weight in such a way that all industries in general and aerospace industry in particular are drifting towards modifying their manufacturing processes and using composite materials in their product development. Helicopter blades are also made of composites (Alkahe & Rand, 2000;Azzam & Andrew, 1992;Morozov, Sylantiev, & Evseev, 2003;Shahid & Chang, 1995). Operating conditions of helicopter rotor are unsteady aerodynamic and acceleration/deceleration loads leading to harsh loading conditions. This may lead to induce damage in the composite material of the rotor. Therefore, progressive failure of helicopter rotor under dynamic loading conditions has attained significant attention of researchers. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the work, few authors have investigated failure analysis. Modal data has been used by some authors to check damage in rotor blades (Pawar & Ganguli, 2003;Alkahe, Rand, & Oshman, 2003). Experimental studies, even more difficult aspect, have been investigated by few authors (Cattarius & Inman, 2000;Gho-shal et al., 2001;Kiddy & Pines, 2001). One way of composite damage modeling is by some percentage reduction in the bending and torsional stiffnesses while some have gone through crack modeling based on fracture mechanics approach (Ganguli, 2002). With the availability of light weight, high strength composite materials, it was felt to perform detailed modeling of damage modes in composite rotor blades. Notable efforts have been done by Pawar and Ganguli (2005) considering ply laminates and matrix cracking was the initial damage observed. Gudmundson and Weilin (1993), Adolfsson and Gudmundson (1997) have investigated generalized composite laminates under combined loading consisting of bending and axial loading. When the matrix cracking effect starts saturating, a local de-lamination can initiate from the matrix crack tips. The de-lamination induced due to matrix cracking was modeled in the literature using various approaches such as classical plate theory (Obrien, 1991), first-order shear deformation laminate plate theory (Armanios, Sriram, & Badir, 1991), variation techniques (Nairn & Hu, 1992), shear lag techniques (Dharani & Tang, 1990) and 3-D finite element analysis of 90° lamina (Salpekar & O'Brien, 1991). Most recently, the shear lag method was applied by Berthelot and Corre (2000) to analyze the stress fields in cross-ply laminates containing transverse cracks and crack tip de-lamination with shear friction between the delaminated plies. While several researchers have modeled separate damage modes as discussed above, few researchers have modeled the progressive damage accumulation in composite structures (Allen, Harris, & Groves, 1987). Most of these models are focused on characterization of cracking in a single sub-laminate with 90° plies. However, under realistic loading condition matrix cracks can appear in all plies and in a multi-directional laminate and may lead to laminate failure by de-lamination or fiber breakage. Such a model was proposed by Shahid and Chang (1995) for predicting the accumulated damage and studied the effect of such damage on the in-plane response of laminated composite plates subjected to tensile and shear loads. \n\nProgressive damage of moderately thick composite laminated plates has been investigated by Ghannadpour and Shakeri (2018) considering in-plane compressive load and uniform lateral pressure. Under same loading conditions, Ghannadpour (Mehrparvar & Ghannadpour, 2018;Ghannadpour & Mehrparvar, 2018) presented analysis of laminate with different shapes and size cut-outs. The concept of minimum potential energy was used for the formulations. Hashin failure criteria have been used to predict the location of failure. Post buckling analysis of cracked imperfect composite plates has been explored by Ghannadpour and Karimi (2018). Progressive damage and nonlinear geometric analysis of relatively thick laminates has been presented by Ghannadpour et al. (2018), Ghannadpour and Shakeri (2018). Two different versions of finite strip method have been used by Ovesy et al. (2006) to predict geometrically nonlinear behavior of composite laminate under progressive end-shortening and to pressure loading. Three geometric degradation models have been employed to estimate the degradation zone around the failure location. Using classical plate theory and first order shear deformation theory, Dawe, Lam, and Azizian (1993) has described the analysis geometrically nonlinear composite laminate behavior to predict local buckling. Ovesy and Ghannadpour (2006) and (Ovesy, Ghannadpour, & Zia-Dehkordi), have used exact finite strip method to predict buckling analysis of moderately thick composite laminate. In their further work, Ghannadpour (Ovesy, Totounferoush, & Ghannadpour, 2015;Ghannadpour & Ovesy, 2009) and Ghannadpour et al. (2014) have presented de-lamination and dynamic buckling of composite laminate using semi analytical finite strip and exact finite strip methods. Other authors (Oktay & Sal, 2015, 2016;Oktay & Sultan, 2013) have also explained active and passive control and helicopter rotor blade morphing for energy efficiency. \n\nFrom the presented literature review, it is revealed that noticeable work has been done by several authors on the geometry and control of the helicopter rotor blade, how-ever, aeroelastic loading, centrifugal loads and their effect on the composite laminate structure along with failure mode prediction is the inter-disciplinary area in which not enough work has been done. The same has been explored in the current work. \n\nIn the present work, a composite helicopter rotor blade (Pawar & Ganguli, 2006) using shell and solid elements has been used. Progressive failure analysis (PFA) has been performed under static aeroelastic loading. Aerodynamic loads are calculated using strip theory. As the velocity is increased so does the load and hence damage is modeled with progressive increase in the load. (Helicopter blade is rotating and hence its vibration modes will be different with that at wind off conditions this effect has been accounted by axial loading of the blade and calculating pre-stressed modes). The key damage modes in composite structure such as matrix cracking, de-lamination and fiber breakage are modeled. The effect of progressive damage accumulation on the composite helicopter rotor blade in forward flight is investigated using a two-cell airfoil section-beam with stiffness properties representing a stiff inplane helicopter rotor blade. \n\nFormulations\n\nVariation formulation\n\nHelicopter blade undergoes flap (out-of-plane) bending, lag (in-plane) bending, elastic twist and axial displacement Using a generalized Hamilton's principal applicable to non-conservative systems (Pawar & Ganguli, 2007) is given as \n\nThe δU and δT include energy contributions from components that are attached to the blade, e.g., pitch link, lag damper, etc. After finite element discretization, Hamilton's principle is written as \n\nAssembling the blade finite element equations and applying boundary conditions in Eq results in the final form of equation ( 3), where {x} and {f} are defined in equation ( 4) \n\n(4) \n\nAerodynamic, inertia and centrifugal forces\n\nHelicopter rotor blade is subjected to lift, gravity and centrifugal forces making its structural and aeroelastic analysis difficult. Gravity force acts downward, lift upward while centrifugal force acts radially outward as shown in Figure 1. The lifting force on a rotating blade is related to its local angle of attack and local dynamic pressure. There is velocity distribution on the blade, zero flow velocity at the rotational axis and the maximum at the tip. Moreover, geometrical twist angle increases from tip to root. \n\nAlthough, the velocity is maximum at the tip, lift is not maximum at the tip because of tip vortices. Lift produced by rotating blade may be described by Blade Element Theory (BET) as Eq. \n\n( \n\nhere, the velocity V, and angle of attack α, are the function of blade radius r. BET assumes no influence of adjacent blade elements section. Moreover, non-uniform induced flow across the blade is obtained through a distribution of geometrical twist along the blade span. Linear geometrical twist has been assumed as given in Figure 2 in the current study. Assumed velocity and lift distributions at 15 rad/ sec are shown in Figure 3. Composite materials are used for the manufacturing of helicopter rotor blade. As the density is assigned to a particular laminate, its mass is calculated by the finite element software through its volume. \n\nGravity force can then be applied globally and the same has been considered in current work. As the helicopter rotor blade rotates, centrifugal force act on the blade radially whose magnitude, mω 2 r, is much more than the gravity and lift force even at low rotation speed. Centrifugal force has been applied using the parameter of rotation speed, ω. \n\nProgressive damage model\n\nThe progressive damage model involves the steps of stress analysis, failure analysis and material properties degradation. These steps, which operate in an iterative procedure following the mentioned order, were incorporated into ANSYS code using APDL. Stress analysis was performed numerically using the commercial Finite Element code ANSYS which can provide the ply-by-ply calculated stresses to be used as input to progressive model. Failure analysis was performed by implementing the commonly used Hashin polynomial failure criteria. These criteria were selected because they can distinguish between different failure modes and may be applied with ease in a finite element formulation. \n\nOnce failure is detected in a ply, the material properties of the ply are degraded by implementing a sudden degradation rule. The scope of using degradation rules is to disable the ply from carrying a certain load. Thus, for each mode of failure there exists a corresponding degradation rule. The available ply-b-ply material property degradation rules are empirical and include assumptions resulting from engineering constraints in the properties of composite materials. \n\nFEA calculation process\n\nThe previously described steps of progressive model were programmed into an ANSYS parametric macro-routine, which works iteratively. The macro-routine involves the following steps. \n\n1. Generating 3-D model of rotor blade by giving as input the initial material properties, specimen geometry, boundary conditions and initial loads. 2. Performing non-linear stress analysis and calculation of the on-axis stresses for each ply. Non-linear stress analysis with the same load is performed again in order to calculate the redistributed stresses. Convergence at a load step is assumed when no additional failures are detected. 11. Repeating the procedure until final failure occurs. The progressive damage model was implemented for rotor blade in order to evaluate its residual strength under incremental tensile loading. \n\nFailure models\n\nFailure criteria compare the loading state at a point with a set of values reflecting the strength of the material at that point (often referred to as the material allowable). For unidirectional materials, this is typically in the direction of the fibers. \n\nIn general, the load is represented by a full stress or strain tensor having six independent components. By convention, for lamina materials the material X axis lies in the direction of the warp fibers while the Z axis lies in the through-thickness direction of the sheet. \n\nDamage criteria and degradation rules\n\nHashin damage criteria in the destruction of the fiber pull-off formula is given in (Tserpes et al., 2002). Damage criteria for fiber pull-out failure mode: \n\nFiber tensile failure is given as: \n\nFiber compressive failure is given as: \n\nMatrix tensile failure is given as: \n\nMatrix compressive failure is given as: \n\nFiber matrix shear failure is given as: \n\nDelamination failure mode under tensile loading is given as: \n\nDelamination failure mode under compression load is given as: \n\nComputational model\n\nIn this study, structural model of a hypothetical helicopter blade as described by Pawar and Ganguli (2006), Pawar and Ganguli (2007) et al., 2013) along with 2 mm balsa web placed at 35% of the chord as shown in Figure 4. Fixed boundary conditions were applied at the root end. Keeping in view the magnitude of centrifugal force which is much higher than the rest of the two forces, failure modes and the first ten modes of vibration (six flap, two lag, two torsion and no axial) have been evaluated with and without centrifugal forces. Figure 5 shows D-spar, shear web and the skin in the finite element model. \n\nFinite element model validation\n\nIn \n\nResults and discussion\n\nAn APDL code has been developed in ANSYS environment putting finite element structural model, lift, gravity, centrifugal forces and the composite failure criteria at one place making the code attractive for the solution of any practical problem. To demonstrate the capability of the code, benchmark hypothetical helicopter blade geometry was chosen and its structural model was validated in the last section. Nonlinear tip deflection matches closely to that of the literature value. There are three types of loadings a helicopter rotor blade experiences during its normal operation which are gravity, lift and centrifugal forces. \n\nFailure modes have been predicted first considering gravity and lift forces, later the centrifugal force is also added to see the combined effect. \n\nIn the first case, gravity and lift forces were applied as both act in the opposite direction. Lift force was varied through rotational speed. Five speeds were considered i.e., 11-15 rad/sec. As the speed is changed, lift force computed through BET is changed; however, gravity force remains constant. Failure in the composite materials is predicted through the failure criteria. Corresponding mode changes have also been computed. No failure is observed as the rotation speed of 11 rad/sec and 12 rad/sec is kept, however, failure is observed near the root section at 13 rad/sec as shown in Figure 7. Nodes plotted in black color experience no failure while matrix cracking was computed at the red plotted nodes. The composite damage progressively increases near the root section as the speed is increased to 14 rad/sec and 15 rad/sec as shown in Figures 8 and Figure 9. As the tip deflection increases with the increase of rotational speed, there is stress stiffening effect in the blade. This behavior is obvious from the plot of first 10 modes in Figure 10. As the rotational speed is set to 11 rad/sec, frequencies of all modes increase; however, there is no further stress stiffening as the speed is further increased from11 rad/sec to 15 rad/sec. In the next computational scheme, centrifugal force is also added along with lift and gravity forces. Out of plane deflections and twist about span axis with and without centrifugal force are shown in Figures 11 and Figure 12. It is obvious from the figures that centrifugal force acts as the stabilizing force and deflection/twist values have reduced in presence of centrifugal force. Moreover, no failure is observed as the rotational speeds are changed from 11 rad/sec to 15 rad/sec. Modal data is plotted in Figure 13. The trend of all modes remains the same as in absence of centrifugal force, however, there is more stress stiffening and hence frequencies at 11 rad/sec is more than those in absence of centrifugal force. Moreover, as expected there is axial and chord wise deformations, although smaller in magnitude, in the presence of centrifugal force as shown in Figures 14 and Figure 15. It can be observed from these figures that magnitude of centrifugal force generated at such low rotational speed, i.e., 15 rad/sec, is quite high as compared to lift, gravity and chord wise force. In actual operation, rotational speed is quite high than this value and hence centrifugal force consideration plays central role in the design of rotating machinery blade. \n\nConclusions\n\nHelicopter rotor blade is subjected to complex aerodynamic loading and therefore, its structural design is of utmost importance. To get high performance of helicopter, rotors are being manufactured from composite materials. Unlike metal structures, composite materials failure modes are complex and no clue is given by these structures before their failure. Hence, investigation of composite structures failure modes has gained popularity in the recent research. \n\nIn the present work, an APDL code in ANSYS environment has been generated encompassing structural model of composite laminate and failure criteria of composites along with gravity, lift and centrifugal forces at one place making the code very attractive for the nonlinear static solution of practical problems. To demonstrate the code capability, a hypothetical helicopter rotor blade from the literature was selected and structural model was validated through the comparison of deflections. It is subjected to gravity and lift forces and failure modes were observed because of out of plane deflections. It was realized that damage starts near the root section and it was matrix cracking. Modal data predicted a stress stiffening effect and hence frequency values of first 10 modes increased. Centrifugal force was further added by rotating the structures at different speeds. It was realized that centrifugal force acted as a stabilizing agent as it restricted the out of plane deflections during the axial rotations. Hence no failure was observed in the presence of centrifugal force on the given speeds. Modal results indicated further stress stiffening and frequency values for first 10 modes further increased. Additionally, the trend of increasing frequency values for bending and torsion with increasing speed is same. In the future work, dynamic analysis will be incorporated to make the code more realistic for practical problems of rotating machinery. It is pertinent to mention that although all possible failure models have been incorporated in APDL code, it is not necessary that all failure modes have been experienced. It depends on the loading conditions and their magnitude. However, it is clarified that as the matrix failure is observed in specific region, stiffness of that region goes to zero and it is not further able to withstand the load. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n",

(Gendler et al., 2022) provided a certified method for conformal prediction by applying randomized smoothing to certify the non-conformity scores.However, such certified coverage could be loose due to the generic nature of randomized smoothing.We propose COLEP with a sensing-reasoning framework to achieve much stronger certified coverage by leveraging the knowledge-enabled logic reasoning capabilities.We provide a comprehensive literature review on certified robustness and logical reasoning in appendix B.\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n\nSuppose that we have n data samples {(Xi, Yi)} n i=1 with features Xi ∈ R d and labels Yi ∈ Y := {1, 2, ..., Nc}.Assume that the data samples are drawn exchangeably from some unknown distribution PXY .Given a desired coverage 1 − α ∈ (0, 1), conformal prediction methods construct a prediction set Ĉn,α ⊆ Y for a new data sample (Xn+1, Yn+1) ∼ PXY with the guarantee of marginal prediction coverage: P[Yn+1 ∈ Ĉn,α(Xn+1)] ≥ 1 − α.\n\nIn this work, we focus on the split conformal prediction setting (Lei et al., 2018;Solari & Djordjilović, 2022), where the data samples are randomly partitioned into two disjoint sets: a training set Itr and a calibration set Using the estimated probabilities that we denote by πy(x), we then compute a non-conformity score S πy (Xi, Yi) for each sample in the calibration set Ical to measure how much non-conformity each validation sample has with respect to its ground truth label.A commonly used non-conformity score for valid and adaptive coverage is introduced by (Romano et al., 2020) as: S πy (x, y) = j∈Y πj(x)I[π j (x)>πy (x)] + πy(x)u, where I [•] is the indicator function and u is uniformly sampled over the interval [0,1].Given a desired coverage 1 − α, the prediction set of a new data point Xn+1 is formulated as:\n\nĈn,α (X n+1 ) = {y ∈ Y : S πy (X n+1 , y)\n\nwhere Q1−α({S πy (Xi, Yi)}i∈I cal ) is the ⌈(1−α)(1+|Ical|)⌉-th largest value of the set {S πy (Xi, Yi)}i∈I cal .\n\nThe prediction set Ĉn,α(Xn+1) includes all the labels with a smaller non-conformity score than the (1 − α)-quantile of scores in the calibration set.Since we assume the data samples are exchangeable, the marginal coverage of the prediction set Ĉn,α(Xn+1) is no less than 1 − α.\n\nLEARNING-REASONING PIPELINE FOR CONFORMAL PREDICTION\n\nTo achieve high certified prediction coverage against adversarial perturbations, we introduce the certifiably robust learning-reasoning conformal prediction framework (COLEP).For better readability, we provide structured tables for used notations through the analysis in Appendix K.\n\nfor l ∈ [L] Once the learning models output their predictions along with estimated probabilities, the reasoning component accepts these estimates as input and passes them through R distinct reasoning subcomponents in parallel.It then combines the probabilities at the outputs of the reasoning subcomponents to calculate the corrected estimates of conditional class probabilities by COLEP, which we denote as πCOLEP j (x) for j ∈ [Nc] (e.g., corrected probability of x having a stop sign or not:\n\nand form the conformal prediction set with them.\n\nREASONING VIA PROBABILISTIC CIRCUITS\n\nWe encode two types of knowledge in the reasoning component: (1) preventive knowledge of the form \"A =⇒ B\" (e.g., \"IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon\"), and (2) permissive knowledge of the form \"B =⇒ A\" (e.g., \"HasContentStop =⇒ IsStopSign\"), where A represents the main task corresponding to the main model (e.g., \"IsStopSign\"), B as one of the L knowledge models (e.g., \"IsOctagon\"), and =⇒ denotes logical implication with a conditional variable as the left operand and a consequence variable on the right.In this part, we consider one particular reasoning subcomponent (i.e., one PC) and encode H preventive and permissive knowledge rules\n\nTo enable exact and efficient reasoning, we need to seek for appropriate probabilistic models as the reasoning component.Recent work (Gürel et al., 2021;Yang et al., 2022) encode propositional logic rules with Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) (Richardson & Domingos, 2006), but the inference complexity is exponential regarding the number of knowledge models.Variational inference is efficient for reaonsing (Zhang et al., 2023), but induces error during reasoning.Thus, we use probabilistic circuits (PCs) to achieve better trade-offs between the model expressiveness and reasoning efficiency.\n\nEncode preventive and permissive knowledge rules with PCs.PCs define a joint distribution over a set of random variables.PCs take an assignment of the random variables as input and output the joint probability of the assignment.Specifically, the input of PCs can be represented by an Nc + L sized vector of Bernoulli random variables (e.g., [IsStopSign, IsOctagon, IsRed, IsDigit]) with the corresponding vector of success probabilities (e.g., π = [πs, πo , πr , πd ]) denoted as:\n\nNote that π is a concatenated vector of the estimated conditional class and concept probabilities of the main model and knowledge models, respectively (e.g., π = [πs, πo , πr , πd ] with Nc = 1, L = 2).Since conformal prediction is our main focus, the conditional probabilities π in eq. ( 4) will be frequently referenced throughout the paper.To distinguish the index representing each class label The output of a PC is typically the root node Oroot representing the joint probability of an assignment (e.g., p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 1|x)).The graph G contains internal sum nodes computing a convex combination of children nodes, and product nodes computing the product of them.\n\nFormally, we let the leaf node O (j ∀ ) leaf in the computational graph G be a Bernoulli distribution with success probability πj ∀ (x).Let µ ∈ M := {0, 1} Nc+L be the index variable (not an observation) of a possible assignment for Nc classes in the interest of the main model and L concepts in the interest of L knowledge models.We also define the factor function F : {0, 1} Nc+L → R + which takes as input a possible assignment µ and outputs the factor value of the assignment:\n\nwhere I [µ∼K h ] = 1 indicates that the assignment µ follows the given logic rule K h , and otherwise\n\n, where K is the rule \"IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon\" with weight w).F (µ) essentially measures how well the assignment µ conforms to the specified knowledge rules.Following (Darwiche, 2002;2003), we let sum nodes compute the logical \"or\" operation, and product nodes compute the logical \"and\" operation.We associate each assignment µ ∈ M with the factor value F (µ) at the level of leaf nodes as fig. 1.Given a feasible assignment of random variables, the output of PC Oroot computes the likelihood of the assignment (e.g., p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctogon = 1|x)).When considering the likelihood of the j-th class label, we can marginalize class labels other than j and formulate the class probability conditioned on input x as:\n\nwhere\n\nfor simplicity of notations and µj denotes the j-th element of vector µ.Note that the numerator and denominator of eq. ( 6) can be exactly and efficiently computed with a single forwarding pass of PCs (Hitzler & Sarker, 2022;Choi & Darwiche, 2017;Rooshenas & Lowd, 2014).We can also improve the expressiveness of the reasoning component by linearly combining outputs of R PCs π(r) j with coefficients βr for the r-th PC as\n\n. The core of this formulation is the mixture model involving a latent variable rPC representing the PCs.In short, we can write πCOLEP j (x) as the marginalized probability over the latent variable rPC as\n\nHence, the coefficient βr for the r-th PC are determined by P[rPC = r].Although we lack direct knowledge of this probability, we can estimate it using the data by examining how frequently each PC r correctly predicts the outcome across the given examples, similarly as in the estimation of prior class probabilities for Naive Bayes classifiers.Illustrative example.We open up the stop sign classification example in fig. 1 further as follows.\n\nThe main model predicts that the image x has a stop sign with probability πs(x).In parallel to it, the knowledge model that detects octagon shape predicts that the image x has an object with octagon shape with probability πo(x).Then we can encode the logic rule \"IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon\" with weight w as fig. 1.The reasoning component can correct the output probability with encoded knowledge rules and improve the robustness of the prediction.Consider the following concrete example.Suppose that the adversarial example of a speed limit sign misleads the main classifier to detect it as a stop sign with a large probability (e.g., πs = 0.9), but the octagon classifier is not misled and correctly predicts that the speed limit sign has a square shape (e.g., πo = 0.0).Then according the computation as eq.( 6), the corrected probability of detecting a stop sign given the attacked speed limit image is πCOLEP s = 0.9/(0.1ew + 0.9), which is down-weighted from the original wrong prediction πs = 0.9 as we have a positive logical rule weight w > 0. Therefore, the reasoning component can correct the wrong output probabilities with the knowledge rules and lead to a more robust prediction framework.\n\nCONFORMAL PREDICTION WITH COLEP\n\nAfter obtaining the corrected conditional class probabilities using COLEP in eq. ( 6), we move on to conformal prediction with COLEP.To begin with, we construct prediction sets for each class label within the learning component.Using eq. ( 1), the prediction set for the j-th class, where j ∈ [Nc], can be formulated as:\n\nwhere 1 − αj is the user-defined coverage level, similar to α in the standard conformal prediction.The fact that element 1 is present in Xn+1) signifies that the class label j is a possible ground truth label for Xn+1 and can be included in the final prediction set.That is:\n\nwhere α = max j∈[Nc] {αj}.It is worth noting that if αj is set to a fixed value for all j ∈ [Nc], α in the standard conformal prediction setting is recovered.In this work, we adopt a fixed α for each αj for simplicity, but note that our framework allows setting different miscoverage levels for each class j, which is advantageous in addressing imbalanced classes.We defer more discussions on the flexibility of defining class-wise coverage levels to Appendix D.1.\n\nCERTIFIABLY ROBUST LEARNING-REASONING CONFORMAL PREDICTION\n\nIn this section, we provide robustness certification of COLEP for conformal prediction.We start by providing the certification of the reasoning component in Section 4.1, and then move to end-to-end certified coverage as well as finite-sample certified coverage in Section 4.2.We defer all the proofs to Appendix.The overview of the certification framework is provided in fig. 4 in Appendix E.\n\nCERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK AND CERTIFICATION OF THE REASONING COMPONENT\n\nThe inference time adversaries violate the data exchangeability assumption, compromising the guaranteed coverage.With COLEP, we aim to investigate (1) whether the guaranteed coverage can be preserved for COLEP using a prediction set that takes the perturbation bound into account, and (2) whether we can provide a worst-case coverage (a lower bound) using the standard prediction set as before in eq. ( 8).We provide certification for goal (1) and (2) in Thms. 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nThe certification procedure can be decomposed into several subsequent stages.First, we certify learning robustness by deriving the bounds for π within the learning component given the input perturbation bound δ.There are several existing approaches to certify the robustness of models within this component (Cohen et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2018;Gowal et al., 2018).In this work, we use randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) (details in Appendix C.3), and get the bound of π under the perturbation.Next, we certify reasoning robustness by deriving the reasoning-corrected bounds using the bounds of the learning component (Thm.1).Finally, we certify the robustness of conformal prediction considering the reasoning-corrected bounds (Thm. 2 and Thm.3).\n\nAs robustness of the learning component is performed using randomized smoothing, we directly focus on the robustness certification of reasoning component.\n\nTheorem 1 (Bounds for Conditional Class Probabilities πCOLEP j (x) within the Reasoning Component).Given any input x and perturbation bound δ, we let [πj ∀ (x), πj ∀ (x)] be bounds for the estimated conditional class and concept probabilities by all models with j ∀ ∈ [Nc + L] (for example, achieved via randomized smoothing).Let V j d be the set of index of conditional variables in the PC except for j ∈ [Nc] and V j s be that of consequence variables.Then the bound for COLEP-corrected estimate of the conditional class probability πCOLEP j is given by:\n\nCERTIFIABLY ROBUST CONFORMAL PREDICTION\n\nIn this section, we leverage the reasoning component bounds in Thm. 1 to perform calibration with a worst-case non-conformity score function for adversarial perturbations.This way, we perform certifiably robust conformal prediction in the adversary setting during the inference time.We formulate the procedure to achieve this in Thm. 2. Theorem 2 (Certifiably Robust Conformal Prediction of COLEP).Consider a new test sample Xn+1 drawn from PXY .For any bounded perturbation ∥ϵ∥2 ≤ δ in the input space and the adversarial sample Xn+1 := Xn+1 + ϵ, we have the following guaranteed marginal coverage:\n\nif we construct the certified prediction set of COLEP where\n\nand S πCOLEP δ j (•, •) is a function of worst-case non-conformity score considering perturbation radius δ:\n\nwith U δ [π COLEP Remarks.Thm. 2 shows that the coverage guarantee of COLEP in the adversary setting is still valid (eq.( 10)) if we construct the prediction set by considering the worst-case perturbation as in eq. ( 11).That is, the prediction set of COLEP in eq. ( 11) covers the ground truth of an adversarial sample with nominal level 1 − α.To achieve that, we use a worst-case non-conformity score as in eq. ( 12) during calibration to counter the influence of adversarial sample during inference.The bound of output probability\n\n) in eq. ( 12) can be computed by Thm. 1 to achieve end-to-end robustness certification of COLEP, which generally holds for any DNN and probabilistic circuits.We also consider the finite-sample errors of using randomized smoothing for the learning component certification as Anonymous (2023) and provided the theoretical statement and proofs in thm.6 in Appendix F.3.Theorem 3 (Certified (Worst-Case) Coverage of COLEP).Consider the new sample Xn+1 drawn from PXY and adversarial sample Xn+1 := Xn+1 + ϵ with any perturbation ∥ϵ∥2 ≤ δ in the input space.We have:\n\nwhere the certified (worst-case) coverage of the j-th class label τ COLEPcer j is formulated as:\n\nRemarks.Thm. 2 constructs a certified prediction set with 1 − α coverage as eq.( 11) by considering the worst-case perturbation during calibration to counter the influence of test-time adversaries.In contrast, Thm. 3 targets the case when we still adopt a standard calibration process without the consideration of test-time perturbations, which would lead to a lower coverage than 1 − α and Thm. 3 concretely shows the formulation of the worst-case coverage.Thm. 3 presents the formulations of the lower bound of the coverage (τ COLEPcer j ) with the standard prediction set as eq.( 8) in the adversary setting.In addition to the certified coverage, we consider finite calibration set size and certified coverage with finite sample errors in Appendix G.\n\nIn Section 5.3, we theoretically show that COLEP achieves better coverage and prediction accuracy than a single main model as long as the utility of knowledge models and rules (characterized in Section 5.1) is non-trivial.To achieve it, we provide a connection between those utilities and the effectiveness of PCs in Section 5.2.The certification overview is provided in fig. 4  Let Ar(j ∀ ) be the set of nodes in the connected component of node j ∀ in graph G r .Let A r,d (j ∀ ) ⊆ Ar(j ∀ ) be the set of conditional variables and Ar,s(j ∀ ) ⊆ Ar(j ∀ ) be the set of consequence variables.For any sample x, let ν(x) ∈ [0, 1] Nc+L be the Boolean vector of ground truth class and concepts such that ν(x\n\n. We denote ν(x) as ν when sample x is clear in the context.For simplicity, we assume a fixed weight w ∈ R + for all knowledge rules in the analysis.In what follows, we characterize the prediction capability of each model (main or knowledge) and establish a relation between these characteristics and the prediction performance of COLEP.\n\nFor each class and concept probability estimated by learning models πj ∀ ∈[Nc+L] : R d → [0, 1] (recall eq. ( 4)), we have the following definition:\n\nwhere tj ∀ ,D , zj ∀ ,D are parameters quantifying quality of the main model and knowledge models in predicting correct class and concept, respectively.In particular, tj ∀ ,D characterizes the threshold of confidence whereas zj ∀ ,D quantifies the probability matching this threshold over data distribution D. Specifically, models with a large tj ∀ ,D , zj ∀ ,D imply that the model outputs a small class probability when the ground truth of input is 0 and a large class probability when the ground truth of input is 1, indicating the model performs well on prediction.We define the combined utility of models within r-th PC by using individual model qualities.For j-th class, we have:\n\nand the utility of associated knowledge rules within r-th PC for the j-th class as:\n\nwhere P d (j) and Ps(j) are PC index sets where j appears as conditional and consequence variables.\n\nquantifies the utility of knowledge rules for class j.Consider the case where j corresponds to a conditional variable in the r-th PC.Small U (r) j indicates that P [νj ∀ = 1, ∀j ∀ ∈ Ar,s(j) |νj = 0 ] is high, hence implication rules for j ∀ are universal and of low utility.\n\nEFFECTIVENESS OF THE REASONING COMPONENT WITH PCS\n\nHere we theoretically build the connection between the utility of knowledge models T (r) j ∀ ,D , Z (r) j ∀ ,D and the utility of implication rules U (r) j ∀ with the effectiveness of reasoning components.We quantify the effectiveness of the reasoning component as the relative confidence in ground truth class probabilities.Specifically, we expect E πCOLEP j (X) − πj(X) |Y = j to be large for j ∈ [Nc] as it enables COLEP to correct the prediction of the main model, especially in the adversary setting.Lemma 5.1 (Effectiveness of the Reasoning Component).For any class probability within models j ∈ [Nc] and data sample (X, Y ) drawn from the mixture distribution Dm, we can prove that:\n\nwhere λ (r) j,D = (1/T (r) j,D + e −w − 1) and we shorthand πj(X) as πj.\n\nRemarks.Lemma 5.1 analyzes the relative confidence of the ground truth class probabilities after corrections with the reasoning component.Towards that, we consider different cases based on the utility of the models and knowledge rules described earlier and combine conditional upper bounds with probabilities.We can quantify the effectiveness of the reasoning component with ϵj,0, ϵj,1 since non-trivial ϵj,0, ϵj,1 can correct the confidence of ground truth class in the expected direction and benefit conformal prediction by inducing a smaller non-conformity score for an adversarial sample.Then we have:\n\n] are class probabilities on benign distribution.Remarks.Thm. 4 shows that COLEP can achieve better marginal coverage than a single model with a high probability exponentially approaching 1.The probability increases in particular with a higher quality of models represented by ϵj,1,D a , ϵj,c,D b , A(πj, D b ).ϵj,1,D a , ϵj,c,D b quantifies the effectiveness of the correction of the reasoning component and is positively correlated with the utility of models\n\nj,D and the utility of knowledge rules U (r) j as shown in Lemma 5.1, indicating that better knowledge models and rules benefits a higher prediction coverage with COLEP.The probability also increases with lower accuracy on the adversarial distribution A(πj, Da), indicating COLEP improves marginal coverage more likely in a stronger adversary setting.Theorem 5 (Comparison of Prediction Accuracy of COLEP and Main Model).Suppose that we evaluate the expected prediction accuracy of πCOLEP j (•) and πj(•) on n samples drawn from Dm and denote the prediction accuracy as A(π COLEP j (•), Dm) and A(πj(•), Dm).Then we have:\n\nRemarks.Thm. 5 shows that COLEP achieves better prediction accuracy than the main model with a high probability exponentially approaching 1.The probability increases with more effectiveness of the reasoning component quantified by a large ϵj,c,D, which positively correlates to the utility of models T (r) j,D , Z (r) j,D and the utility of knowledge rules U (r) j as shown in Lemma 5.1, indicating that better knowledge models and rules benefits a higher prediction accuracy with COLEP.In Appendix I, we further show that COLEP achieves higher prediction accuracy with more useful knowledge rules.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nWe evaluate COLEP on certified conformal prediction in the adversarial setting on various datasets, including GTSRB (Stallkamp et al., 2012), CIFAR-10, and AwA2 (Xian et al., 2018).For fair comparisons, we use the same model architecture and parameters in COLEP and baselines CP (Romano et al., 2020) andRSCP (Gendler et al., 2022).The desired coverage is set 0.9 across evaluations.Note that we leverage randomized smoothing for learning component certification (100k Monte-Carlo sampling) and consider the finite-sample errors of RSCP following Anonymous (2023) and that of COLEP following Thm.6.We fix weights w as 1.5 and provide more details in Appendix J. Construction of the reasoning component.In each PC, we encode a type of implication knowledge with disjoint attributes.In GTSRB, we have a PC of shape knowledge (e.g.,\"octagon\", \"square\"), a PC of boundary color knowledge (e.g., \"red boundary\", \"black boundary\"), and a PC of content knowledge (e.g., \"digit 50\", \"turn left\").Specifically, in the PC of shape knowledge, we can encode the implication rules such as IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon (stop signs are octagon), IsSpeedLimit =⇒ IsSquare (speed limit signs are square).In summary, we have 3 PCs and 28 knowledge rules in GTSRB, 3 PCs and 30 knowledge rules in CIFAR-10, and 4 PCs and 187 knowledge rules in AwA2.\n\nWe also provide detailed steps of PC construction in appendix J.1.Certified Coverage under Bounded Perturbations.We evaluate the certified coverage of COLEP given a new test sample X n+1 with bounded perturbation ϵ (|ϵ| 2 < δ) based on our certification in Thm. 3. Certified coverage indicates the worst-case coverage during inference in the adversary setting, hence a higher certified coverage indicates a more robust conformal prediction and tigher certification.We compare the certified coverage of COLEP with the SOTA baseline RSCP (Theorem 2 in (Gendler et al., 2022)).The comparison of certified coverage between COLEP and RSCP is provided in Figure 2. The results indicate that COLEP consistently achieves higher certified coverage under different ℓ 2 norm bounded perturbations, and COLEP outperforms RSCP by a large margin under a large perturbation radius δ = 0.5.Note that an obvious upper bound of the certified coverage in the adversary setting is the guaranteed coverage without an adversary, which is 0.9 in the evaluation.\n\nThe closeness between the certified coverage of COLEP τ COLEP (cer)\n\nand the upper bound of coverage guarantee τ (cer) shows the robustness of COLEP and tightness of our certification.Prediction Coverage and Prediction Set Size under Adversarial Attacks.We also evaluate the marginal coverage and averaged set size of COLEP and baselines under adversarial attacks.COLEP constructs the certifiably robust prediction set following Thm. 2. We compare the results with the standard conformal prediction (CP) and the SOTA conformal prediction with randomized smoothing (RSCP).For fair comparisons, we apply PGD attack (Madry et al., 2018) with the same parameters on CP, RSCP, and COLEP.For COLEP, we consider the adaptive PGD attack against the complete learning-reasoning pipeline.The comparison of the marginal coverage and averaged set size for CP, RSCP, and COLEP under PGD attack (δ = 0.25) is provided in Figure 3.The results indicate that the marginal coverage of CP is below the nominal coverage level 0.9 under PGD attacks as data exchangeability is violated, while COLEP still achieves higher marginal coverage than the nominal level, validating the robustness of COLEP for conformal prediction in the adversary setting.Compared with RSCP, COLEP achieves both larger marginal coverage and smaller set size, demonstrating that COLEP maintains the guaranteed coverage with less inflation of the prediction set.The observation validates our theoretical analysis in Thm. 4 that COLEP can achieve better coverage than a single model with the power of kwowledge-enabled logical reasoning.We provide more evaluations of different coverage levels 1 − α, different perturbation bound δ, different conformal prediction baselines, and contributions of different knowledge rules in Appendix J.2.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we present COLEP, a certifiably robust conformal prediction framework via knowledge-enabled logical reasoning.We leverage PCs for efficient reasoning and provide robustness certification.We also provide end-to-end certification for finite-sample certified coverage in the presence of adversaries and theoretically prove the advantage of COLEP over a single model.We included the discussions of limitations, broader impact, and future work in Appendix A.\n\nK Overview of notations\n\nA DISCUSSIONS, BROADER IMPACT, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK Broader Impact.In this paper, we propose a certifiably robust conformal prediction framework COLEP via knowledge-enabled logic reasoning.We prove that for any adversarial test sample with ℓ 2 -norm bounded perturbations, the prediction set of COLEP captures the ground truth label with a guaranteed coverage level.Considering distribution shifts during inference time and weakening the assumption of data exchangeability has been an active area of conformal prediction.COLEP demonstrates both theoretical and empirical improvements in the adversarial setting and can inspire future work to explore various types of distribution shifts with the power of logical reasoning and the certification framework of COLEP.Furthermore, robustness certification for conformal prediction can be viewed as the generalization of certified prediction robustness, which justifies a certifiably robust prediction rather than a prediction set.Considering the challenges of providing tight bounds for certified prediction robustness, we expect that COLEP can motivate the certification of prediction robustness to benefit from a statistical perspective.\n\nLimitations.A possible limitation may lie in the computational costs induced by pretraining knowledge models.The problem can be partially relieved by training knowledge models with parallelism.Moreover, we only need to pretrain them once and then can encode different types of knowledge rules based on domain knolwedge.The training cost is worthy since we theoretically and empirically show that more knowledge models benefit the robustness of COLEP a lot for conformal prediction.Another possible limitation may lie in the access to knowledge rules.For the datasets that release hierarchical information (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-100, Visual Genome), we can easily adapt the information to implication rules used in COLEP.We can also seek knowledge graphs (Chen et al., 2020b) with related label semantics for rule design.These approaches may be effective in assisting practitioners in designing knowledge rules, but the process is not fully automatic, and human efforts are still needed.Overall, for any knowledge system, one naturally needs domain experts to design the knowledge rules specific to that application.There is probably no universal strategy on how to aggregate knowledge for any arbitrary application, and rather application-specific constructions are needed.This is where the power as well as limitation of our framework comes from.\n\nFuture work.The following directions are potentially interesting future work based on the framework of COLEP: 1) exploring different structures of knowledge representations and their effectiveness on conformal prediction performance, 2) proposing a more systematic way of designing logic rules based on domain knowledge, and 3) initiating a better understanding of the importance of different types of knowledge rules and motivating better design of rule weights accordingly.\n\nDiscussions.We will consider the cases where the knowledge graph is contaminated by adversarial attackers or contains noises and misinformation in this part.The robustness of COLEP mainly originates from the knowledge rules via factor function F (•) denoting how well each assignment conforms to the specified knowledge rules.Since the knowledge rules and weights are specified by practitioners and fixed during inferences, the PCs encoding the knowledge rules together with the main model and knowledge models (learning + reasoning component in Figure 1) can be viewed as a complete model.According to the adversarial attack settings in the literature Goodfellow et al. ( 2014); Gendler et al. ( 2022), the model weights can be well protected in practical cases and the attackers can only manipulate the inputs but not the model, and thus, the PC graph (i.e., the source of side information) which is a part of the augmented model can not be manipulated by adversarial attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, it is an interesting question to discuss the case when the knowledge rules may be contaminated and contain misinformation due to the neglect of designers.We can view the problem of checking knowledge rules and correcting misinformation as a pre-processing step before the employment of COLEP.The parallel module of knowledge checking and correction is well-explored by a line of research Melo & Paulheim (2017); Caminhas (2019); Chen et al. (2020a), which basically detects and corrects false logical relations in the semantic embedding space via consistency-checking techniques.It is also interesting to leverage more advanced large language models to check and correct human-designed knowledge rules.We deem that the process of knowledge-checking is independent and parallel to COLEP, which may take additional efforts before the deployment of COLEP but significantly benefits in achieving a much more robust system based on our analysis and evaluations.\n\nAlternative certification.There are two general certification directions for certifiably robust conformal prediction: (1) plugging in the standard score for for test example, and the quantile is computed on the worst-case scores for each calibration point as in our paper;\n\n(2) plugging in the worst-case score for the test example and the standard score for each calibration point.We can also adapt the results with the second line based on the symmetry between x and x ′ is indeed an interesting point.Specifically, given perturbed x ′ during test time, we can compute the bounds of output logits in the δ-ball, which will also cover the clean x.Since the logit bounds also hold for clean x, we can compute the worst-case scores based on the bounds and finally construct the prediction set with the clean quantile value.The two lines of certification are essentially parallel.It is fundamentally due to the exchangeability of clean samples, which leads to consideration of worst-case bounds either during calibration or inference.One practical advantage of the first line of certification might be that the computation of worst-case bounds requires more runtime, and thus, computing it during the offline calibration process might be more desirable than during the online inference process.\n\nDiscussions of selection of rule weights.If a knowledge rule is true with a lower probability, then the associated weight rule should be smaller, and vice versa.For example, there might be a case that a knowledge rule only holds with probability 70%.In the example, the probability is with respect to the data distribution, which means that 70% of data satisfies the rule \"IsStopSign→IsOctogan\".\n\nBesides, other factors such as the portions of class labels also affect the importance of corresponding rules.If one class label is pretty rare in the data distribution, then the knowledge rules associated with it clearly should be assigned a small weight, and vice versa.In summary, the importance of knowledge rules depends on the data distribution, no matter whether we select it via grid search or optimize it in a more subtle way.Therefore, we deem that a general guideline for an effective and efficient selection of rule weights is to perform a grid search on a held-out validation set, which is also essential for standard model training.However, we do not think the effectiveness of COLEP is quite sensitive to the selection of weights.From the theoretical analysis and evaluations, we can expect benefits from the knowledge rules as long as we have a positive weight w for the rules.\n\nB MORE RELATED WORK\n\nCertified Prediction Robustness To provide the worst-case robustness certification, a rich body of work has been proposed, including convex relaxations (Zhang et al., 2018;Li et al., 2019;Kang et al., 2023b), Lipschitz-bounded model layers (Tsuzuku et al., 2018;Singla et al., 2022;Xu et al., 2022b), and randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019;Salman et al., 2019;Li et al., 2021;2022a).However, existing work mainly focuses on certifying the prediction robustness rather than the prediction coverage, which is demonstrated to provide essential uncertainty quantification in conformal prediction (Jin et al., 2023).In this work, we aim to bridge worst-cast robustness certification and prediction coverage, and design learning frameworks to improve the uncertainty certification.\n\nKnowledged-Enabled Logical Reasoning Neural-symbolic methods (Ahmed et al., 2022;Garcez et al., 2022;Yi et al., 2018) use symbols to represent objects, encode relationships with logical rules, and perform logical inference on them.DeepProbLog (Manhaeve et al., 2018) and Semantic loss (Xu et al., 2018) are representatives that leverage logic circuits Brown ( 2003) with weighted mode counting (WMC) to integrate symbolic knowledge.Probabilistic circuits (PCs) (Darwiche, 2002;2003;Kisa et al., 2014) are another family of probabilistic models which allow exact and efficient inference.PCs permit various types of inference to be performed in linear time of the size of circuits (Hitzler & Sarker, 2022;Choi & Darwiche, 2017;Rooshenas & Lowd, 2014).\n\nWorst-case Certification.In particular, considering potential adversarial manipulations during test time, where a small perturbation could mislead the models to make incorrect predictions (Szegedy et al., 2014;Madry et al., 2018;Xiao et al., 2018;Cao et al., 2021), different robustness certification approaches have been explored to provide the worst-case prediction guarantees for neural networks.\n\nFor instance, a range of deterministic and statistical worst-case certifications have been proposed for a single model (Wong & Kolter, 2018;Zhang et al., 2018;Cohen et al., 2019;Lecuyer et al., 2019), reinforcement learning (Wu et al., 2022a;Kumar et al., 2022;Wu et al., 2022b), federated learning paradigms (Xie et al., 2021;2022), and fair learning (Kang et al., 2022;Ray Chaudhury et al., 2022), under constrained perturbations (Balunovic et al., 2019;Li et al., 2021;2022a).\n\nC PRELIMINARIES C.1 PROBABILISTIC CIRCUITS\n\nDefinition 1 (Probabilistic Circuit).A probabilistic circuit (PC) P defines a joint distribution over the set of random variables X and can be defined as a tuple (G, ψ), where G represents an acyclic directed graph (V, E), and ψ : V → 2 X the scope function that maps each node in V to a subset of X (i.e., scope).This scope function maps the nodes in the graph to specific subsets of random variables X.A leaf node Oleaf of G computes a probability density over its scope ψ(Oleaf).All internal nodes of G are either sum nodes (S) or product nodes (P ).A sum node S computes a convex combination of its children: S = N ∈ch(S) wS,N N where ch(S) denotes the children of node S. A product node P computes a product of its children:\n\nThe output of PC is typically the value of the root node O root .We mainly focus on the marginal probability computation inside PCs (e.g., P[\n\nThe inference of marginal probability is tractable by imposing structural constraints of smoothness and decomposability : (1) decomposability: for any product node P ∈ V, ψ(v1) ∩ ψ(v2) = ∅, for v1, v2 ∈ ch(P ), v1 ̸ = v2, and 2) smoothness: for any sum node S ∈ V, ψ(v1) = ψ(v2), for v1, v2 ∈ ch(S).With the constraint of decomposability, the integrals on the product node P can be factorized into integrals of children nodes ch(P ), which can be formulated as follows:\n\nWith the constraint of smoothness, the integrals on the sum node S can be decomposed linearly to integrals on the children nodes ch(S), which can be formulated as: We can see that the smoothness and decomposability of PCs enable the integral computation on parent nodes to be pushed down to that on children nodes, and thus, the integral x∈X,xj =1 O root (x) or x∈X O root (x) can be computed by a single forwarding pass of the graph G.In total, we only need two forwarding passes in the graph G to compute the marginal probability P[\n\nKnowledge rules in PCs.For the implication rule A =⇒ B, we define A as conditional variables and B as consequence variables.Suppose that the r-th PC encodes a set of implication rules defined over the set of Boolean variables V r .The PC is called a homogeneous logic PC if there exists a bipartition V rd and V rs (V rd ∪ V rs = V, V rd ∩ V rs = ∅) such that all variables in V rd only appear as conditional variables and all variables in V rs only appears as consequence variables.We construct homogeneous logic PCs to follow the structural properties of PCs (i.e., decomposability and smoothness) and can show that such construction is intuitive in real-world applications.For example, in the road sign recognition task, we construct a PC with the knowledge of shapes.We encode a set of implication rules A =⇒ B where A is the road sign, and B is the corresponding shape (e.g., a road sign can imply an octagon shape).We can verify that such a PC is a homogeneous PC and follow the structural constraints in the computation graph G, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nC.2 MULTIPLE PCS WITH COEFFICIENTS β r IN THE COMBINATION OF PCS\n\nLet us consider the case with R PCs.The conditional class probability of the j-th class corrected by r-th PC can be formulated as:\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n\nwhere µj denotes the j-th element of vector .Hr, K hr , w hr are the number of knowledge rules, the h-th logic rule, and the weight of the h-th logic rule for the r-th PC.Note that the numerator and denominator of eq. ( 24) can be exactly and efficiently computed with a single forwarding pass of PCs (Hitzler & Sarker, 2022;Choi & Darwiche, 2017;Rooshenas & Lowd, 2014).Specifically, the inference time complexity of one PC defined on graph (V, E) with node set V and edge set E is O(|V|).\n\nWe improve the expressiveness of the reasoning component by combining R PCs with coefficients βr for the r-th PC.Formally, given data input x, the corrected conditional class probability πCOLEP j can be expressed as:\n\nWe also note that the coefficients βr correspond to the accuracy of r-th PC normalized over all PC accuracies.The core of this formulation is the mixture model involving a latent variable r PC representing the PCs.In short, we can write π(r) j (x) as π(r) j (x) = P[Y = y|X = x, r PC = r], and πCOLEP j (x) as the marginalized probability over the latent variable r PC such as: With input perturbation ∥ϵ∥ 2 ≤ δ, the smoothed model satisfies:\n\nwhere Φ is the Gaussian cumulative density function (CDF) and Φ −1 is its inverse.\n\nIn practice, we can estimate the expectation in g j (x; σ) by taking the average over many i.i.d.realizations of Gaussian noises following (Cohen et al., 2019).Thus, the output probability of the smoothed model can be bounded given input perturbations.Note that the specific ways of certifying the learning component are orthogonal to certifying the reasoning component and the conformal prediction procedure, and one can plug in different certification strategies for the learning component.\n\nD CONFORMAL PREDICTION WITH COLEP\n\nD.1 FLEXIBILITY OF USER-DEFINED COVERAGE LEVEL\n\nIn this part, we illustrate the flexibility of COLEP to use different miscoverage levels α j for different label classes j ∈ [N c ] and prove the guaranteed coverage.Recall that in the standard conformal prediction setting, we are given a desired coverage 1 − α and construct the prediction set of a new test sample Ĉn,α (X n+1 ) with the guarantee of marginal coverage:\n\nIn COLEP, we construct the prediction set ĈCOLEPj n,αj (X n+1 ) for the j-th class (j ∈ [N c ]) as in Equation ( 7)\n\nand construct the final prediction set ĈCOLEP n,α (X n+1 ) as in Equation ( 8).Then we have the following:\n\nTherefore, we conclude that as long as we set max j∈[Nc] {α j } ≤ α, we have the guarantee of marginal coverage:\n\nThe flexibility of COLEP to set various coverage levels for different label classes is advantageous in addressing problems related to the imbalance of classes.For example, when samples of class j are extremely vulnerable to be attacked by the adversary, we can set a higher miscoverage level α j for class j to consider the class-specific vulnerability instead of setting a higher α for all classes which may affect the performance on other classes.\n\nD.2 ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE\n\nLet us consider the example of classifying whether the given image has a stop sign in Figure 1.The main model generates an estimate π(x), meaning that the image x has a stop sign with probability π(x).Suppose that we have a knowledge model to detect whether the image has an object of octagon shape with an estimate πo (x), meaning that the image x has an object of octagon shape with probability πo (x).Then we can encode the logic rule \"IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon\" with weight w in the PC, as shown in Figure 1.The PC defines a joint distribution over the Bernoulli random variables IsStopSign and IsStopSign and computes the likelihood of an instantiation of the random variables at its output (e.g., p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 0)).The represented joint distribution in the PC is determined by the encoded logic rule with the pattern in the top PC of Figure 1.We can see that only the assignment (IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 0) is not multiplied by the weight w due to the contradiction of the rule.Therefore, the probability of instantiations of random variables with such contradictions will be down-weighted after the correction of the PC.In the simple PC, we formally compute the class probability as: p(IsStopSign = 1) ={p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 0) + p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 1)}/ {p(IsStopSign = 1, p(IsOctagon = 0) + p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 1) +p(IsStopSign = 0, IsOctagon = 0) + p(IsStopSign = 0, IsOctagon = 1)} .\n\n(33) Note that the nominator and denominator can be tractably computed by a forwarding pass of the PC graph.COLEP can enlarge the probability estimate p(IsStopSign = 1) when x is a stop sign and reduce it when x is not a stop sign by leveraging additional concept information p(IsStopSign, as rigorously analyzed in Lemma 5.1.\n\nE OVERVIEW OF CERTIFICATION\n\nWe provide the overview of certification flow in Figure 4, for a better understanding the connections

of COLEP.The certification setting is that the inference time adversaries can violate the data exchangeability assumption, compromising the guaranteed coverage.Therefore, the certification generally achieves the following three goals.( 1) We can preserve the guaranteed coverage using a prediction set that takes the perturbation bound into account (Thm.2), achieved by computing the probability bound of models before the reasoning component (by randomized smoothing) and the bound after the reasoning component (by Thm. 1).( 2) We prove the worst-case coverage (a lower bound) if we use the standard prediction set as before (Thm.3).( 3)\n\nWe theoretically show that COLEP can achieve a better prediction coverage (Thm.4) and prediction accuracy (Thm.5) than a data-driven model without the reasoning component.\n\nthe models with j ∀ ∈ [N c + L].Let V j rd be the set of index of conditional variables in the r-th PC except for j ∈ [N c ] and V j rs be that of consequence variables.Then the bound for COLEP-corrected estimate of the conditional class probability πCOLEP j is given by:\n\nProof of Thm. 1.We first provide a lemma that proves the monotonicity of the complex function with respect to the estimated condition probabilities of conditional variables and consequence variables within PCs as follows.\n\nLemma F.1 (Function Monotonicity within PCs).We define the target function as G(q, d) =\n\n).Then we have ∂G/∂ πq (x) ≤ 0 if class label q corresponds to a conditional variable in the PC and ∂G/∂ πq (x) ≥ 0 if class label q corresponds to a consequence variable in the PC.\n\nProof of Lemma F.1.Note that the function G(q, d) is linear with respect to πq (x).To explore the monotonicity, we only need to determine the sign of the coefficients of πq (x).We first consider the case where class label q corresponds to a conditional variable.We can rearrange the expression of G(q, d) as follows:\n\nThen we rearrange the coefficients of πq (x) as follows:\n\nwhere R(µ, q) : {0, 1} Nc+L × Z + → {0, 1} Nc+L rewrites the q-th dimension of vector µ to 1.Note that when q is the index of a conditional variable, given any implication logic rule K hr , we have\n\nSimilarly, when q is the index of a consequence variable, given any implication logic rule K hr , we have\n\nConsider the r-th PC.We first rearrange the formulation of the class conditional probability π(r) j (x) to the pattern of function G(•) and then leverage Lemma F.1 to derive the upper and lower bound.The reformulation of π(r) j (x) is shown as the following:\n\nNext, we focus on deriving the lower bound L[π (r) j (x)], and the upper bound can be derived similarly.\n\nIn Equation ( 41), we relax the numerator and denominator separately and then will show how to derive the upper bound of the numerator and the lower bound of the denominator in Equation ( 41).We can apply Lemma F.1 for any q ∈ [N c + L]\\{j} and get the following:\n\nwhere V j rd is the set of index of conditional variables in the r-th PC except for j ∈ [N c ] and V j rs is that of consequence variables.\n\nFrom Equation (41) and Equation ( 42), we can derive the final bound of πCOLEP j (x) by considering all the PCs:\n\nTheorem 2 (Recall).Consider a new test sample X n+1 drawn from P XY .For any bounded perturbation ∥ϵ∥ 2 ≤ δ in the input space and the adversarial sample Xn+1 := X n+1 + ϵ,

the proof of Thm. 2 in Appendix F.2.\n\nG FINITE-SAMPLE CERTIFIED COVERAGE\n\nIn this section, we consider the finite-sample error induced by the finite size of the calibration set I cal .\n\nWe provide the finite-sample certified coverage in the adversary setting as follows.\n\nCorollary 1 (Certified Coverage with Finite Samples).Consider the new sample X n+1 drawn from PXY and adversarial sample Xn+1 := X n+1 + ϵ with any perturbation ∥ϵ∥ 2 ≤ δ in the input space.\n\nWe have the following finite-sample certified coverage:\n\nwhere |I cal | is the size of the calibration set in conformal prediction.\n\nProof sketch and remarks.Leveraging corollary 1 of (Massart, 1990) and following the sketch in (Yang & Kuchibhotla, 2021), we can prove the finite-sample error bound.Combining the finitesample error with the certified coverage bound in Thm. 3 concludes the proof.Note that the union bound is applied to multiple models in (Yang & Kuchibhotla, 2021) while we circumvent it by aggregating individual results for class labels subtly, and thus, COLEP achieves an improved sample complexity of conformal prediction compared with ensemble learning given the same tolerance of finite-sample error.\n\nProof of Corollary 1. From Corollary 1 of (Massart, 1990), we have that for all ϵ > 0,\n\nFor ease of notation, we let:\n\nIt implies that:\n\nThen using Equation ( 93), we can bound E[W ] as follows:\n\nInequality (a) follows from Formula 7.1.13 of (Abramowitz & Stegun, 1948).Finally, combining the results in Thm. 3, we get:\n\nH OMITTED PROOFS IN SECTION 5\n\nH.1 PROOF OF LEMMA 5.1 Lemma 6.1 (Recall).For any class probability within models j ∈ [N c ] and data sample (X, Y ) drawn from the mixture distribution D m , we can prove that:\n\nwhere λ (r) j,D = (1/T (r) j,D + e −w − 1) and we shorthand πj (X) as πj .\n\nProof of Lemma 5.1.We first consider one PC and then analyze the effectiveness of R linearly combined PCs.Without loss of generality, we focus on the class conditional probability by the r-th\n\nRecall that we map a set of implication rules encoded in the r-th PC to an undirected graph G r = (V r , E r ), where V r = [N c + L] corresponds to the Boolean vector of class and concept predictions in the learning stage.There exists an edge between node j 1 ∈ V r and node j 2 ∈ V r iff they are connected by an implication rule j 1 =⇒ j 2 or j 2 =⇒ j 1 .Let A r (j ∀ ) be the set of nodes in the connected component of node j ∀ except for node j ∀ (i.e., j ∀ / ∈ A r (j ∀ )).Let A r,d (j ∀ ) ⊆ A r (j ∀ ) be the set of conditional variables and A r,s (j ∀ ) ⊆ A r (j ∀ ) be the set of consequence variables.Denote M j be the universal set of assignments except for the j-th element.Let P d (j) and P s (j) be the set of PC index where j appears as conditional variables and consequence variables, respectively.\n\nWe consider a mixture of benign and adversarial distributions denoted by D m , which indicates that an input x is either a benign example drawn from D b with probability p D b := P[x ∼ D b ] or an adversarial example drawn from D a with probability p Da := P[x ∼ D a ], where p D b + p Da = 1.We analyze the effectiveness of PCs in four cases: case (1) r ∈ P d (j) and Y ̸ = j, case (2) r ∈ P d (j) and Y = j, case (3) r ∈ P s (j) and Y = j, and case (4) r ∈ P s (j) and Y ̸ = j.We leave the probability conditions on Y = j or Y ̸ = j in each case for simplicity and consider them in the conclusions.\n\nCase (1) r ∈ P d (j) and Y ̸ = j.We can derive the class conditional probability by PCs as follows:\n\nNote that since r ∈ P s (j), we have µ∈M, µj =0 exp\n\n, and thus, π(r) j (x) ≤ πj (x) holds.Next, we analyze the gap to get a tight bound based on the distribution of the Boolean vector of the ground truth class and concepts ν.\n\nCase (1a): If ∃j ∀ ∈ A r,s (j), ν j ∀ = 0, then we have:\n\n≥ 1\n\nWhen we have models such that πj\n\nj,D ), we leverage the general bound in the case,\n\nWhen we have models of high quality such that πj\n\nj,D ), we can derive a tighter bound as follows:\n\nIn inequality (a), we plug in the lower bound of confidence of a correct prediction t j ∀ ,D and the upper bound of confidence of a wrong prediction 1 − t j ∀ ,D for label j ∀ .\n\nCombining Equations ( 109) and ( 113), we get the following bound for case (1a):\n\nwhere λ (r) j,D = (1/T (r) j,D + e −w − 1).Case (1b): If ∀j ∀ ∈ A r,s (j), ν j ∀ = 1, then we use the general bound in the case:\n\nNote that case (1a) is with probability U (r) j\n\nand case (1b) is with probability 1 − U (r) j .Combining Equation (114) in case (1a) and Equation (115) in case (1b), we have:\n\nCase (2): r ∈ P d (j) and Y = j.Since in the r-th PC j is the index of a conditional variable, we have ∀j ∀ ∈ A r,s (j), ν j ∀ = 1, where ν is the ground truth Boolean vector.Then we have the following:\n\nThen the following holds in case (2):\n\nCase (3): r ∈ P s (j) and Y = j.As in Case (1), we similarly consider cases based on the distribution of ground truth Boolean vector ν to get a tighter bound.\n\nCase (3a): ∃j ∀ ∈ A r,d (j), ν j ∀ = 1.\n\nWhen we have models such that πj\n\n) Equation ( 121) holds because in case (3), j corresponds to a consequence variable in the r-th PC, and thus, we always have:\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 When we have models of high quality such that πj ∀ (x) ≤ 1 − t j ∀ ,D |ν j ∀ = 0 and πj ∀ (x) ≥ 1 − t j ∀ ,D |ν j ∀ = 1 , ∀j ∀ ∈ A r (j) (with probability Z (r) j,D ), we can derive a tighter bound as follows:\n\nTherefore, the following holds in case (3a);\n\nCase (3b): If ∀j ∀ ∈ A r,d (j), ν j ∀ = 0, then we leverage the general bound:\n\nNote that case (3a) is with probability U (r) j and case (3b) is with probability 1 − U (r) j .Combining Equations ( 126) and ( 127), the following holds:\n\nCase (4): r ∈ P s (j) and Y ̸ = j.Since j is the index of a consequence variable, we have ∀j ∀ ∈ A r,d (j), ν j ∀ = 0.

cross-entropy loss for the knowledge models.\n\nKnowledge Rules & Reasoning.In summary, we have 3 PCs and 28 knowledge rules in GTSRB, 3 PCs and 30 knowledge rules in CIFAR-10, and 4 PCs and 187 knowledge rules in AwA2.Based on the domain knowledge in each dataset, we encode a set of implication rules into PCs.In each PC, we encode a type of implication knowledge with disjoint attributes.In GTSRB, we have a PC of shape knowledge (e.g.,\"octagon\", \"square\"), a PC of boundary color knowledge (e.g., \"red boundary\", \"black boundary\"), and a PC of content knowledge (e.g., \"digit 50\", \"Turn Left\").In CIFAR-10, we have a PC of category knowledge (e.g., \"animal\", \"transportation\"), a PC of space knowledge (e.g., \"in the sky\", \"in the water\", \"on the ground\"), and a PC of feature knowledge (e.g., \"has legs\", \"has wheels\").In AwA2, we have a PC of superclass knowledge (e.g., \"procyonid\", \"big cat\"), a PC of predation knowledge (e.g., \"fish\", \"meat\", \"plant\"), a PC of appearance (e.g., \"big ears\", \"small eyes\"), and a PC of fur color knowledge (e.g., \"green\", \"gray\", \"white\").\n\nFor example, in the PC of shape knowledge in GTSRB, we can encode the implication rules related to the shape knowledge such as IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon (stop signs are octagon) with weight w 1 , IsSpeedLimit =⇒ IsSquare (speed limit signs are square) with weight w 2 , and IsTurnLeft =⇒ IsRound (turn left signs are round) with weight w 3 .To implement the COLEP learning-reasoning framework, we follow the steps to encode the rules into PCs.(1) We learn the main model and knowledge models implemented with DNNs to estimate a preliminary probability for N c class labels and L concept labels (e.g., p(IsSpeedLimit = 1) = πsp , p(IsSquare = 1) = πsq ).( 2) We compute the factor value F (µ) for any possible assignment µ ∈ {0, 1} Nc+L as\n\nsince the assignment satisfy all three knowledge rules above).(3) We construct a three-layer PC as shown in Figure 1: (a) the bottom layer consists of leaf nodes representing Bernoulli distributions of all class and concept labels and the constant factor values of assignments (e.g., B(π sp ), B(1 − πsp ), B(π sq ), B(1 − πsq ), ..., F ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), F ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]), ...), (b) the second layer consists of product nodes computing the likelihood of each assignment by multiplying the likelihood of the instantiations of Bernoulli variables and the correction factor values (e.g., πsp × πsq × . . .× F ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])), and (c) the top layer is a sum node computing the summation of the products.(4) We linearly combine multiple PCs that encode different types of knowledge rules (e.g., 3 PCs in GTSRB: PCs of shape/color/content knowledge).We compute β k based on the utility of the k-th PC on the calibration set and manually set the weights of knowledge rules based on their utility.\n\nCodes are available at https://github.com/kangmintong/COLEP.Visualization of the contribution of different knowledge rules.In GTSRB, we consider the contribution of the shape knowledge rules, color knowledge rules, and content knowledge rules.In CIFAR-10, we consider the contribution of the category knowledge rules, space knowledge rules, and feature knowledge rules.More details of the meanings and examples of knowledge rules are provided in Appendix J.1.We provide the visualization of contributions of different types of knowledge rules in Figure 5.The results show that the rules related to the color knowledge in GTSRB and space knowledge in CIFAR-10 benefit the certified coverage more, but collectively applying all the well-designed knowledge rules leads to even better coverage.The effectiveness of these types of knowledge attributes to a higher utility of the knowledge models (i.e., the accuracy of concept detection).Concretely, the feature of these concepts is relatively easy to learn and can be more accurately detected (e.g., color concepts are more easily learned than shape concepts).The correlation between the knowledge model utility and effectiveness of COLEP is also theoretically analyzed and observed in Section 5. Runtime evaluation of COLEP.Since the knowledge models in the learning component are simple neural networks and can perform forward passes in parallelism, the additional computational complexity of COLEP comes mainly from the overhead of the reasoning component (i.e., PC).Given a PC defined on the directed graph (V, E), the time complexity of probabilistic inference is O(|V|), according to the details illustrated in Appendix C.1.Therefore, the additional time complexity of COLEP is O(|V|), linear to the number of nodes in PC graph.We empirically evaluate the runtime of a forward pass of COLEP and compare it with a standard model.The results in Table 1 show that COLEP only achieves a little higher runtime compared with a single standard model.Evaluations with different types of adversarial attacks.To evaluate the robustness of COLEP under various types of attacks, we further consider the AutoAttack method Croce & Hein (2020), which uses an ensemble of four diverse attacks to reliably evaluate the robustness: (1) APGD-CE attack, (2) APGD-DLR attack, (3) FAB attack, and (4) square attack.APGD-CE and APGD-DLR attacks are step size-free versions of PGD attacks with cross-entropy loss and DLR loss, respectively.FAB attack optimizes the adversarial sample by minimizing the norm of the adversarial perturbations.Square attack is a query-efficient black-box attack.We evaluate the prediction coverage and averaged set size of COLEP and SOTA method RSCP with ℓ 2 bounded perturbation of 0.25 on GTSRB, CIFAR-10, and AwA2.The desired coverage is 1 − α = 0.9 in the evaluation.The results in Table 2 show that under diverse and stronger adversarial attacks, COLEP still achieves higher marginal coverage than the nominal level 0.9 and also demonstrates a better prediction efficiency (i.e., smaller size of prediction sets) than RSCP.\n\nJ.2 ADDITIONAL EVALUATION OF COLEP\n\nEvaluations with various nominal levels.We further evaluate COLEP with multiple nominal levels of coverage 1 − α.We provide the results with multiple coverage levels 1 − α in Table 3.The results demonstrate that for different parameters of α, (1) COLEP always achieves a higher marginal coverage than the nominal level, indicating the validity of the certification in COLEP, and (2) COLEP shows a better trade-off between the prediction coverage and prediction efficiency (i.e., average set size) than the SOTA baseline RSCP.\n\nSelection of weights of knowledge rules.The weight w of logical rules is specified based on the utility of the corresponding knowledge rule.In Section 6, we theoretically show that the robustness of COLEP correlates with the utility of knowledge rules regarding the uniqueness of the rule, defined in Equation ( 17).Specifically, a universal knowledge rule which generally holds for almost all class labels is of low quality and does not benefit the robustness and should be assigned with a low weight w.For example, if all the traffic signs in the dataset are of octagon shape, then the implication rule IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon should be useless and assigned with a low weight w, which also aligns with the intuition.In the empirical evaluations, since we already designed knowledge rules of high quality (i.e., good uniqueness) as shown in Section 7, we do not need to spend great efforts selecting weights for each knowledge rule individually.We assume that all the knowledge rules have the same weight w and select a proper weight w for all the knowledge rules via grid searching.The results inspire us to fix w as 1.5, and the evaluations demonstrate that it is sufficient to achieve good robustness in different settings.One can also model the weight selection problem as a combinatorial optimization, which is non-trivial but can better unleash the power of COLEP.We leave a more intelligent and automatic approach of knowledge weight selection for future work.\n\nK OVERVIEW OF NOTATIONS\n\nIn this section, we provide overviews of used notations for a better understanding of the analysis of COLEP.Specifically, we provide an overview of notations related to models in Table 4, notations related to conformal prediction in Table 5, notations related to certification in Section 4 in Table 6, and notations related to analysis in Section 5 in Table 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We can upper bound the probability of miscoverage of the main task with the probability of miscoverage of label classes as follows:≤ max≤ max≤ maxwhere ĈCOLEP δ n,α,j ( Xn+1 ) := q y ∈ {0, 1} :is the certified prediction set for the class label j.Note that Equation (50) holds because we have S πCOLEP δ j (X n+1 ,). Next, we will prove Equation (50) rigorously.We first consider the probability of miscoverage conditioned on Y n+1 = j.Similarly, we consider the probability of miscoverage conditioned on Y n+1 ̸ = j.Combining Equation (55) and Equation (59), we prove that Equation (50) holds.Finally, from Equation (51), we prove that:if we construct the certified prediction set of COLEP whereand S πCOLEP δ j (•, •) is a function of worst-case non-conformity score considering perturbation radius δ:where] are computed by plugging in the β-confidence probability bound [π j ∀ (x; β), πj ∀ (x; β)] into Thm. 1.The high-confidence bound [π j ∀ (x; β), πj ∀ (x; β)] can be obtained by randomized smoothing as the following:where Ê is the empirical mean ofis the Berstein's finite-sample error.Proof of Thm. 6. Bounding the finite-sample error of randomized smoothing similarly as Theorem 1 in Anonymous (2023), we get that for a given j ∀ ∈ [N c + L], we have the following:We can upper bound the probability of miscoverage of the main task with the probability of miscoverage of label classes as follows:where ĈCOLEP δ n,α,j ( Xn+1 ) := q y ∈ {0, 1} :is the certified prediction set for the class label j.Note that Equation (70) holds because we have S πCOLEP δ j). Next, we will prove Equation (70) rigorously.We first consider the probability of miscoverage conditioned on Y n+1 = j.Similarly, we consider the probability of miscoverage conditioned on Y n+1 ̸ = j.Combining Equation (77) and Equation (82), we prove that Equation (70) holds.Finally, from Equation (72), we prove that:F.4 PROOF OF THM. 3Theorem 3 (Recall).Consider the new sample X n+1 drawn from PXY and adversarial sample Xn+1 := X n+1 + ϵ with any perturbation ∥ϵ∥ 2 ≤ δ in the input space.We have:where the certified coverage of the j-th class label τ COLEPcer j is formulated as:Proof of Thm. 3. We can bound the probability of coverage of the main task with the probability of coverage of label classes as follows:Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 H.3 PROOF OF THM. 5Theorem 5 (Recall).Suppose that we evaluate the expectation of prediction accuracy of πCOLEP j (•) and πj (•) on n samples drawn from D m and denote the prediction accuracy as A(π COLEP j (•), D m ) and A(π j (•), D m ).Then we have:Proof of Thm. 5. We can formulate the accuracy of πj (•) on D m as:Similarly, A(π COLEP j (•), D m ) can be formulated as:. Note that we have ϵ j,0,D > 0 and ϵ j,1,D > 0 by assumption.Then by rearranging the terms and Hoeffding's inequality, we can derive as follows:Similarly, we consider the case conditioned on Y = j.Note that from Equations (160) and (164), we have the following relation:Finally, by considering both the adversarial distribution and benign distribution, we can conclude that: .Assume that we aggregate PCs by taking the average (i.e., β r = 1/R).Then we have:Proof sketch.We construct a sequence {J r } R r=1 in a specific way and prove that it is a supermartingale or a sub-martingale with bounded differences conditioned based on the true label.Then we use Azuma's inequality to bound the objective A(π COLEP j , D m ) in different cases and combine them with union bound.Remarks.Lemma 5.1 indicates that better utility of knowledge models and implication rules can indicate a smaller E COLEP j,0and larger E COLEP j,1, which can further imply a tighter lower bound of prediction accuracy according toThm.7. Furthermore, according to the proof, we know that E COLEP j,0 negatively correlates with the number of PCs R and E COLEP j,1 has a positive correlation with R, indicating that more PCs (i.e., knowledge rules) implies a better prediction accuracy.Proof of Thm. 7. Consider R PCs.We construct a sequence {J r } R r=1 such that J r (X) = 1 r q∈ [r]  π(q) j (X), where π(q) j (•) is defined as Equation (24).We first consider the case conditioned on Y ̸ = j.Without loss of generality, assume that π(1)Then we can prove {J r } R r=1 is a super-martingale since we have the following:{J r } R r=1 also has bounded difference since we have the following:Also note that we have:Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Therefore, {J ′ r } R r=1 is conditionally independent.Then by using Azuma's inequality, we can derive as follows:Finally, the following holds.Note that we can formulate A(π COLEP j , D m ) as:Combining Equations (182) and (195), we have: Implementation details.We run evaluations using three different random seeds and report the averaged results.We omit the standard deviation of the results since we observe they are of low variance due to a large sample size used for calibration and testing.All the evaluation is done on a single A6000 GPU.In the evaluation of certified coverage, we compute the smoothed score or prediction probability 100, 000 times for randomized smoothing and fix the ratio of perturbation bound and the smoothing factor during certification δ/σ cer as 0.5 for both RSCP and COLEP.In the evaluation of marginal coverage and set size under PGD attack, we use the attack objective of   undirected graph encoded with rules in the r-th PC A r (j ∀ ) node set in connected components of node j ∀ in graph G r A r,d (j ∀ ) node set of conditional variables in connected components of node j ∀ in graph G r A r,s (j ∀ ) node set of consequence variables in connected components of node j ∀ in graph G r ν(x) boolean vector of ground truth class and concepts given sample x as input t j∀,D the threshold of confidence for the j ∀ -th label z j∀,D probability matching this threshold for the j ∀ -th label T the set of PC index where j appears as conditional variables and consequence variables U (r) j utility of associated knowledge rules within the r-th PC for the j-th class ϵ j,0 ,ϵ j,1 characterization of probability correction by COLEP conditioned on ground truth label 0 and 1 ϵ j,0,D ϵ j,0,D = E (X,Y )∼D [ϵ j,0 |ν j = 0], expectation of ϵ j,0 ϵ j,1,D ϵ j,1,D = E (X,Y )∼D [ϵ j,1 |ν j = 1], expectation of ϵ j,1 A(π, D) accuracy of probability estimator π on data distribution D\nHandbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables.
