## Description

In this project we try to answer the following research question:"

> Can automatically constructed, weighted citation
graph provide meaningful signals about how well sci-
entific claims are supported, and help identify citation
weaknesses or circular referencing patterns?

We analyze whether citations with higher system-assigned criticality align
with citation weaknesses identified by human annotators, and whether the resulting graph structure helps
identify circular or weakly supported referencing patterns.
