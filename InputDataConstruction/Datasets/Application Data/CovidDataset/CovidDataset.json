    "title": "COVID-19: A Bibliometric Analysis and Insights",
    "full_text": "A contagious disease caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. This disease exploded rapidly in China and world (Lai et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020a). The illness caused by the novel coronavirus was named as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). On March 12th, 2020, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) professed COVID-19 as a pandemic. According to a recent Chinese study, about 80% of patients present with mild disease and the overall case-fatality rate is about 2.3% but reaches 8.0% in patients aged 70 to 79 years and 14.8% in those aged greater than 80 years (Wu and McGoogan, 2020). However, there is probably an important number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus the mortality rate is probably overestimated. The United States of America (U.S.A.) (more than three million cases), Brazil (more than two million cases), India (more than one million cases), Russia (more than half of the million cases), South Africa, Peru, Mexico, Chile, Spain, UK, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Germany (with each having over 200K cases) are currently the worst affected countries (as of July 20th 2020 as per WHO report). Thus, there is an urgent need to combat this virus to contain its effect in symptomatic patients and to decrease the duration of virus carriage to limit the transmission in the community. There are around 22 countries where this virus affected more than 100K people until July 20 th 2020 and 41 countries with around 50K cases. The total global number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 14 million from the WHO report on July 20 th , 2020. Unfortunately, no drug is 100% efficacious in treating this infectious disease; several vaccines are under trial in many countries but have yet to be approved to treat human coronaviruses. Several options have been envisaged to control or prevent emerging infections of 2019-nCoV as per the C.D.C. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and ClinicalTrials.gov including vaccines (B.C.G. vaccine), monoclonal antibodies (sarilumab), oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, antibiotics (azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine), antihelminthics (ivermectin) and antiviral (favipiravir, ramdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir) drugs. However, new efficacious interventions specifically targeted against COVID-19 are likely to require months to years to develop. Rushdi and Serag (2020) diagnostic testing aspects of mathematical epidemiology culminate in a timely application to and a discussion of the contemporary worldwide COVID19 pandemic. This article is based on methodology proposed by Mayring (2000). Section 2 gives a quick tour of the adopted methodology. Section 3 discusses the descriptive analysis and material evaluation along with the current epidemiological insights. Section 4 provides an enriched discussion of the topic that elaborates the characteristics of the coronaviruses further. Section 5 presents a conclusion of the review study. The present study aims to analyse the work done in this field through a state-of-the-art review of articles based on COVID-19 and discuss the current trends in the epidemiology of this disease entity with special reference to India and the effects of this pandemic on the environment. The essential steps for the literature review studies are material collection, descriptive analysis, category selection, and material evaluation as has been defined in the landmark book by Mayring (2000). This is a standard approach and has been adopted in several previous studies for analysing the studies on a particular area of interest (Seuring and Müller, 2008;Gao et al., 2017). With the help of a literature review, it is easy to identify the conceptual content of the research area. The first step of the research methodology is a material collection that gives an idea about the data collection with regards to that particular topic. In this step, we clarify the source for the data collection. For this study, we have collected the data from the Scopus ® database until April 10th, 2020. We have summarised all the past studies related to the COVID-19 obtained from the Scopus ® database. The search was performed on April 10th, 2020, and finally, we included 581 articles, published since the beginning of this topic. This paper adopts a systematic literature review approach to understand past studies related to COVID-19. This paper summarises the most contributed authors, country, and journals in the field of COVID-19 by analysing recently published articles from different publishers. Also, with the help of VOSviewer ® software, we visualised the authors, co-authors and institute network visualisation. The distance between two authors in the visualisation approximately indicates the relatedness of the authors in terms of co-citation links. In general, the closer two authors are located to each other, the stronger their relatedness. The strongest co-citation links between authors are also represented by lines. Table 1 shows how the 'search' keywords were used in the Scopus ® database. The total number of papers was 1899, efficient to conduct the review, however, we carefully compiled these results and removed the repetition of the papers, non-English language papers, editorials, chapters, and thus, the final sample of papers included in the study for bibliometric analysis is 581. The total number of articles for a detailed systematic review is 33. The inclusion criteria for the systematic review is based on the articles that have at least ten citations and published in a high-quality journal. This section gives the basic idea about the general statistics based on the articles on COVID-19 which has been collected from the Scopus ® database. In this section, we summarise the top authors, countries, and institutes that contributed to the field of COVID-19. Since the topic is novel for the researchers and practitioners, therefore, the amount of published work is relatively less. From the collected data compiled in Figure 1, it can be seen that most of the publications on COVID-19 are contributed by China. In this category, United States, United Kingdom, Italy, and Canada have the second, third, fourth, and fifth positions, respectively. All the top 15 countries are represented in Figure 1. In the field of COVID-19, Mahase, E published the highest number of articles. Rimmer, A, Hsueh, PR, Iacobucci, G, and Day, M hold the second, third, fourth, fifth position, respectively (Figure 2). These results are dynamic as the consideration of the number of papers is till April 10th, 2020. There are not many articles from India at present on COVID-19. Most of them have been in the form of case reports and guidelines issued by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which is also acting as one of the main advisory bodies to the Indian Government in controlling this pandemic. Figure 3 shows the most contributed journal in the field of Covid-19 based on the number of publications in Scopus index journals. Figure 2. Most contributing authors in the field of COVID-19 205 99 43 29 24 19 19 18 16 16 15 15 15 13 13 0 50 100 150 200 250 Number of Publications Top 15 Countries/Terrritories based on the number of publications 19 13 7 6 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Number of In this section, we have summarised the network visualisation based on most contributed author, co-author (Van Eck and Waltman, 2010), and institute in the field of Covid-19 with the help of VOSviewer® software. 87 33 25 14 10 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 7 7 7 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Number of Publications Most contributed journals Figure 4 shows the network visualisation. This section also lists the contributing authors not only from the medical field but from various others as well. The distance between two authors in the visualisation approximately indicates the relation of the authors in terms of co-citation links. In general, the closer two authors are located to each other, the stronger their relation in terms of cocitations. Also, the strongest co-citation links between authors are represented by lines. From the point of statistical analysis, it is observed that the number of patients suffering from COVID-19 is increasing rapidly. If the number of patients crosses the limit of the medical facilities available in the country, then the situation will turn more dangerous, and it will not be easy to control. Therefore, in any country, if the number of patients suffered from COVID-19 is less than the medical facilities available in that country, then we can conclude that the situation is under control. Despite any such favoring statistics, the citizens must take proper precautions because of the exponential growth of this pandemic. Figure 5 shows two situations; the first one shows if the maximum number of patients is below the line, then the situation is under control, but on the other hand, if the curve is above the line then it will infer an out of control situation. Further, for an out of control situation the virus spread will increase exponentially that will lead to damage in terms of almost everything viz. health, wealth, peace, economy, etc. Figure 6 shows the COVID-19 situation reports based on the WHO database. The trend line shows that the number of affected people is increasing exponentially daily. Further, due to such a distressing situation, lockdowns and curfews are a common practice throughout the globe. On January 20th, 2020, WHO declared the presence of 282 COVID-19 infected people and from Figure 6, it is quite distinct that the situation has worsened since then. Figure 6 also shows a comparison among the number of cases in China, India and Globally. It is well-known and comprehensible that the first case was reported in China, after which it increased and took a sharp spread over the globe. Also, initially, the situation was not under control in China, but as the reports of the infected rose sharply, China succeeded in controlling this epidemic in their region by taking radical measures. However, the virus spread increased and is still worsening in other regions of the world. Table 2 summarises the recent studies of COVID-19 based on the Scopus ® database. The articles listed in table 2 have at least ten citations, according to the Scopus ® database. Table 2. High impact articles on COVID-19 S.No. Authors Findings 1. Huang et al. (2020) This study reported the \"epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of affected patients in Wuhan, China\". 2. Zhu et al. (2020) The analyses of this study provide evidence \"implicating 2019-nCoV in the Wuhan outbreak\". 3. Chen et al. (2020 a) This study concluded that \"the infection of 2019-nCoV was of clustering onset, is more likely to infect older men with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as ARDS\". 4. Chan et al. (2020 a) \"The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of unexplained pneumonia in a Shenzhen family cluster connected to a Wuhan hospital\" were presented. 5. Zhou et al. (2020) This study reported \"the identification and characterisation of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China.\" 6. Lu et al. (2020) This study described \"the genomic characteristics of 2019-nCoV and similarities and differences to other coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002-03. Genome sequences of 2019-nCoV sampled from nine patients who were among the early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically identical, which suggested a very recent emergence of this virus in humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly\". 7. Holshue et al. (2020) This study reported, \"the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and described the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the patient's initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness\". 8. A study of \"a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on December 26th 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough\" was presented. 9. Wan et al. (2020) Here, the authors analysed \"the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV\". Table 2 continued… 10. Chen et al. (2020b) This research reported \"the study of nine patients who had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two),\" were also observed. 11. Ji et al. (2020) An \"evolutionary analysis using 272 genomic sequences of coronaviruses obtained from various geographic locations was performed. The results showed that the novel coronavirus sequence obtained from the viral pneumonia outbreak occurring in the city of Wuhan forms a separate group that is highly distinctive to SARS-CoV\". 12. Chen et al. (2020c) This study introduced the general features of coronaviruses. A bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection was performed and compared with other related coronavirus genomes. 14. This study highlighted \"the ongoing pandemic and concluded that Epidemiologic information on the pathogenicity and transmissibility of this virus obtained through molecular detection and serosurveillance is needed to fill in the details in the surveillance pyramid and guide the response to this outbreak\". Moreover, the study suggested that \"the propensity of novel coronaviruses to spread in health care centers indicates a need for peripheral health care facilities to be on standby to identify potential cases as well\". 15. Chung et al. (2020) This work represents \"an early investigation of chest C.T. findings in the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), intending to create familiarity with common imaging manifestations of the disease\". Further, the study says that \"the radiologist plays a crucial role in the rapid identification and early diagnosis of new cases, which can be of great benefit not only to the patient but to the larger public health surveillance and response systems\". 16. Xu et al. (2020a) This showed that \"the Wuhan CoV shared with the SARS/SARS-like coronaviruses a common ancestor that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9-1\". 17. Russell et al. (2020) The authors concluded that \"corticosteroid treatment should not be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial\". 18. Xu et al. (2020b) This study is under regulations issued by the National Health Commission of China and the Helsinki Declaration. The authors quoted that their findings will \"facilitate understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and improve clinical strategies against the disease\". 19. Zou et al. (2020) This study analysed \"the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients with the day of onset of any symptoms\". 20. Wang et al. (2020b) The study enlightened the readers through their article in which they clarified the disease and said: \"the 2019-nCoV infection is spreading fast with an increasing number of infected patients nationwide\". Also, \"the future development of the disease is not clear but the public should be cautious in dealing with the virus since it may be very contagious. The first occurred deaths were majorly elderly people who might have faster disease progression. The public should pay more attention to protecting elderly people who have contracted the virus.\" 21. Bai et al. (2020) The authors observed that \"all symptomatic patients had multifocal ground-glass opacities on chest C.T., and 1 also had subsegmental areas of consolidation and fibrosis. All the symptomatic patients had increased C-reactive protein levels and reduced lymphocyte counts.\" 22. Gralinski and Menachery (2020) The authors thought that \"the emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has awakened the echoes of SARS-CoV from nearly two decades ago. Yet, with technological advances and important lessons gained from previous outbreaks, perhaps the world is better equipped to deal with the most recent emergent group 2B coronavirus\". 23. Riou and Althaus (2020) The analysis suggested that \"the early pattern of human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of SARS-CoV emergence in 2002. International collaboration and coordination will be crucial to contain the spread of 2019-nCoV\". 24. The study suggested that \"the disease is a clinical threat and suggested that one should aggressively implement infection control measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 via human-to-human transmission\". 25. Backer et al. (2020) This study characterised \"the distribution of incubation periods for travelers from Wuhan infected with 2019-nCoV who were reported as cases between 20 and 28 January 2020\". 26. Lei et al. (2020) In this article, on \"the basis of epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, chest images, and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia\" was made. \"After receiving 3 days of treatment, combined with interferon inhalation, the patient was clinically worse with progressive pulmonary opacities found at repeat chest C. T.\". 27. Song et al. (2020) This study clarified that \"nearly all patients in this series with 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, pneumonia (50 of 51 patients, 98%) had a history of contact with individuals from Wuhan, China. Further, Chest CT showed pure ground-glass opacities (G.G.O.s) in 77% of patients, G.G.O.s with interstitial and/or interlobular septal thickening in 75% of patients, and G.G.O.s with consolidation in 59% of patients. A chest CT, G.G.O.s were bilateral in 88% of patients, involving the posterior lungs in 82% and the peripheral lungs in 85% of patients\". Table 2 continued… 28. Bogoch et al. (2020) This study evaluated \"the potential for international dissemination of this disease via commercial air travel should the outbreak continue\". 29. Liang et al. ( 2020) \"Three major strategies for patients with cancer in this COVID-19 crisis, and in future attacks of severe infectious diseases\" was proposed. 30. Wax et al. (2020) This paper summarised important considerations \"regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as a preparation for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV\" were made. 31. Zhang et al. (2020a) Detailed clinical investigation of \"140 hospitalised COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, a high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients\". 32. Kim et al. (2020) This report suggested that \"in the early phase of 2019-nCoV pneumonia, chest radiography would miss patients with pneumonia and highlighted that taking travel history is of paramount importance for early detection and isolation of 2019-nCoV cases\". 33. Zhang et al. (2020b) An investigation was conducted on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. \"The presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route was found. It was also showed that the serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV maybe shed through multiple routes\". COVID-19 is spreading globally. It falls under a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals and humans. COVID-19 belongs to the order Nidovirales and family Coronaviridae (Chan et al., 2020b;Lu et al., 2020). The name Corona comes after the crown-like enveloped structure consists of a single layer of lipid. Envelop of Coronavirus contains positive sense, single-stranded R.N.A. (+ssRNA) as a genetic material of 27-32 kb in size (Chan et al., 2020b;Lu et al., 2020). In humans, respiratory infections such as common cold to some of the severe diseases including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are known to be caused due to this family of viruses. Recently, COVID-19 is discovered as a highly infectious disease caused by coronaviruses. SARS and COVID-19 are different from each other, as no outbreak has been seen of SARS since 2013. The virus and disease COVID-19 were not reported before the outbreak arises in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The increased replication fidelity is believed to be due to the expanded genome size of COVID-19 over other viruses. The genetic expansion of COVID-19 leads to the acquisition of accessory proteins coding genes that provide benefits to the virus for host adaptation. Consequently, the genetic changes caused by gene insertion or deletion, gene interchange, and recombination are frequent among coronaviruses (Chen et al., 2020c). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is a highly infectious disease which is caused by a novel virus. Bats are believed to be the possible transmitters (Zhou et al., 2020). Bats often possess a higher percentage of zoonotic viruses compared to other mammalian orders (Ji et al., 2020). A wide investigation on relationships between mammalian hosts and viruses hypothesised that flight ability of bats gives the selection pressure for coexistence with the virus (Zhou et al., 2020). Certainly, bats were known for a carrier of few highly pathogenic human diseases viruses such as henipaviruses (Nipah virus), bat lyssaviruses (Rabies virus) and of course the coronaviruses (SADS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) (Ji et al., 2020;Zhou et al., 2020). Most of the persons diseased with the COVID-19 virus will encounter slight to temperate respiratory problems and recuperate without needing distinct treatment. Aged people and those with multiple medical problems like cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory diseases are more prone to grow stern sickness (Wang et al., 2020a). The disease in advanced cases leads to acute respiratory problems (like flu) with major signs such as fever, cough, and in further severe cases, it leads to difficulty in breathing (Chen et al., 2020a, Huang et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020). The other symptoms that have also been reported by other patients infected with COVID-19 are nasal congestion, pains, and aches, runny nose, diarrhea or sore throat (Huang et al., 2020). The person suffering from COVID-19 may experience initial mild symptoms with a gradual increase. According to the report of WHO, one infected person could infect 2-5 people on an average. The aged person or people having health issues such as immuno-compromised (weak immunity), cancer, diabetes, heart problems, kidney failure or high blood pressure are highly prone to this disease (Wang et al., 2020a;Liang et al., 2020). The disease mainly spreads through communication with a diseased individual by coughing and sneezing (droplet spread) and also by touching, kissing, and physical contact (Riou and Althaus, 2020). Airborne transmission has not yet been reported. The COVID-19 has an incubation period of approximately 7-14 days depending upon the immunity and age of host animals, while most commonly around 5 days (Backer et al., 2020). Since the rapid detection test kits for detection of COVID-19 is under development; therefore, people facing problems such as difficulty in breathing, dry cough, and fever need attention Indubitably, the COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the whole world, despite such destruction the air pollution is slashing at most of the places around the globe. The temporary halt throughout the globe has brought to the forefront surprising climate changes including fewer carbon-emissions. Also, the satellite images (European Space Agency) showed a dramatic decrease in the atmospheric nitrous oxide. The premature deaths due to air pollution are around 4.6 million (World Health Organization). Surprisingly, due to temporary and preventive measures of COVID-19, the quality of air has significantly improved in various areas throughout the globe. For instance, NASA and the European Space Agency (E.S.A.) pollution monitoring satellites have detected significant decreases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China. The change in these NO2 levels is closely related to the global halt. However, such events can still not be considered a silver lining for the environment. India is going through a crucial juncture with its fight against COVID-19. The well-known responsive measures against this pandemic are to find, isolate, test, treat, and trace. The total number of infected personals in India is rising rapidly and spreading a stressful situation nationwide. The average age of deaths caused by COVID-19 in India till April 06 th, 2020, was 60 years. The case fatality rate or the case fatality ratio is calculated as the fraction of deaths among all the diagnosed cases over a certain period. The overall C.F.R. comes out to be 2.7% which is aligned with the trend in other countries. As per the study of the ICMR, 9.4% of the country is diabetic which signifies the fact that diabetes emerged as the leading co-morbidity among the deaths due to COVID-19 (Gupta and Misra, 2020). Though, the country has responded to this pandemic through a determined step of National Lockdown. However, once the lockdown is discontinued the Government is in a vulnerable situation and dealing with the hardships of the lockdown. Undoubtedly, a lockdown of this enormous magnitude will not be without cost. A proper agenda will be required to deal with the repercussion of the national lockdown. One of the severe challenges is to ensure that the poor and daily wage workers who are prevented from working for longer periods can survive. As per the Centre of Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE), the nationwide lockdown witnessed the joblessness rate to nearly triplicating and quadrupling in the urban areas. The unemployment rate was already at a terrifying 8.7% in March, and with the lockdown, it gushed up to 23.8%. On a positive note, every crisis provides the opportunity to learn. Certainly, the virus has disrupted human life and the global economy, but the efforts to contain this virus through various restrictions have remarkably influenced the environment positively. The reduced emissions due to the transport sector and strike in other emissions-related activities are gradually minimising the air pollutants. Though this is not an ideal way to curb pollution but it is evident that air pollution is manmade. The present review paper presents an overview of the literature on coronaviruses since the beginning. The analysis presented in this review provides interesting insights regarding the past and progress of this pandemic in the world. The Scopus database is used to perform this review study. The study highlights the most contributed authors, institutions, countries and their interrelation in a way that has not presented before in this regard. An elongated discussion is included to give an insight into COVID-19 from scratch. The Novel outbreak of COVID-19 disease has some very high research scopes particularly required for its prevention, cure and efficient dealing. Research studies focusing on curtailing the ongoing outbreak and preventing future outbreaks of such kind is the most pressing need. One of the immediate extensions would be to develop a review study by using medical databases like PubMed, EMBASE, etc. Moreover, looking towards the social impact of this disease, the rural enterprise has severely affected due to various Government policies viz. curfew, lockdowns, restrictions, etc. So, a distinct and worthwhile research direction would be to give policy dimensions for the betterment of rural enterprises.",

    "title": "Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20–28 January 2020",
    "full_text": "Here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from Wuhan with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the early outbreak phase, using their reported travel histories and symptom onset dates. In January 2020, an increasing number of cases confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV were detected outside Wuhan. For 88 cases detected between 20 and 28 January, the travel history (to and) from Wuhan is known, as well as their symptom onset date. Their ages range from 2 to 72 years of age (information missing for four cases); 31 were female and 57 were male. During this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were infected in Wuhan. Consequently, their time spent in Wuhan can be taken as the duration of exposure to infection. Of these 88 cases with known travel history, 63 were Wuhan residents who travelled elsewhere and 25 were visitors who stayed in Wuhan for a limited time. By taking the date of symptom onset and travel history together, we inferred the possible incubation period for each of these cases. The data used for this analysis has been translated from Chinese sources such as provincial centres of disease control, and made publicly available (Anon, 2020). We took the data as available on 29 January 2020 (Supplementary Material S1). Using the duration of stay in Wuhan and the symptom onset date, we obtained a range of possible values for the incubation period of each case. We fitted three parametric forms for the incubation period distribution to these ranges: the Weibull distribution, the gamma distribution and the lognormal distribution. We used a Bayesian approach to fitting that allows for the use of prior knowledge to inform the analysis. We specified strictly positive flat prior probability distributions The analysis yields the probability of being infected (dark pink), i.e. the cumulative density function of the estimated infection moments, using the Weibull distribution. for the parameter values of the three distributions (Supplementary Material S2), which ensured our estimates are conservative. Because of the sufficient number of observations, the impact of the priors on the outcome was negligible. We used a uniform prior probability distribution over the exposure interval for the moment of infection for each case. We sampled from the posterior distribution using the rstan package (Development & Team, n.d.) in R software version 3.6.0 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) (Supplementary Material S3). Figure 1 shows the exposure to reporting timeline for each case, where the cases without a maximum incubation period lack an unexposed (grey) period. However, the estimated infection times for these cases are close to the end of the exposure window, informed by the cases that do have a maximum incubation period. The Weibull distribution provided the best fit to the data (Table 1). The mean incubation period was estimated to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CI): 5.6-7.7). The incubation period ranges from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) (Table 2 and Figure 2). The results using the gamma distribution provide a slightly poorer description of the data, but a similar range: from 2.4 to 12.5 days. Although the lognormal distribution provides the poorest fit to the data, the incubation period ranging from 2.4 to 15.5 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) may be relevant for a conservative choice of quarantine periods. A comparison to the estimated incubation period distribution for MERS (Table 3 and Figure 3) shows that the incubation period values are remarkably similar, with mean values differing at most 1 day and 95th percentiles differing at most 2 days. The estimated mean incubation periods for SARS are more variable between studies, including values shorter and longer than those presented here for 2019-nCoV. These findings imply that the findings of previous studies that have assumed incubation period distributions similar to MERS or SARS will not have to be adapted because of a shorter or longer incubation period. We characterised the distribution of incubation periods for travellers from Wuhan infected with 2019-nCoV in Wuhan who were reported as cases between 20 and 28 January 2020. The study provides empirical evidence to back reports on a familial cluster where five family members developed symptoms 3 to 6 days after exposure (Chan et al., 2020), and fits within the range for the incubation period of 0 to 14 days assumed by the WHO and of 2 to 12 days assumed by the ECDC (Anon, 2020). Our estimate of the mean incubation period is longer than the value of 5.2 days based on 10 cases (Li et al., 2020), and 4.8 days (range: 2-11) based on 16 travellers between Wuhan and Guangdong (Liu et al., 2020). The latter study is restricted to travellers with a 3-day exposure window. Repeating our analysis with only the 25 visitors to Wuhan who had a closed exposure window, leads to a mean incubation period of 4.5 days (CI: 3.7-5.6) which is more in line with the studies above, but the 95th percentile drops to 8.0 days (CI: 6.3-11.8). In our analysis, we assumed a uniform prior probability of being infected during the period of stay in Wuhan. Since the epidemic was developing during that time period, it is more likely that travellers were infected towards the end rather than the beginning of their stay. This might produce a slight bias towards longer incubation periods, so the estimated upper limit of 11.1 days could be considered conservative. The travellers in this study represent a selective sample of the reported cases. We found travellers to be more often male and younger than the cases reported in (Li et al., 2020). The numbers are too small to detect systematic differences in incubation time with age or sex. Because we only have information on confirmed cases, there is likely a bias towards more severe cases in areas with early awareness and a well-functioning healthcare system. As the epidemic continues, it remains important to collect more information on the incubation periods of 2019-nCoV cases with older ages, with underlying morbidity, who are women or who have mild symptoms. 0 5 10 15 20 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Incubation period (days) Cumulative probability Posterior median of mean is indicated by the dark blue line and the 95% credible interval by the light blue area.

The results with the three often-used forms we report here suggest that there is little impact on the mean and dispersion of the incubation periods. Of these three, the lognormal distribution assigns higher probabilities to longer incubation periods. Although we found that this distribution provided a poorer description of the data than the Weibull and the gamma distributions, it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic.

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that started in Wuhan, China. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine durations. Early January 2020, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the infectious agent causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, where the first cases had their symptom onset in December 2019 [1]. This newly discovered virus, which causes severe acute respiratory disease, is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, but distinct from each of these [2]. The key epidemiological parameters, including incubation period, for this new virus are therefore rapidly being studied from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. Chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. The range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3-5] and the transmission potential [6,7]. In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, these studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses.",

    "full_text": "Since the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Lu et al., 2020) , it has rapidly spread across China and many other countries (Li et al., 2020)(Gorbalenya et al., 2020)(Chen et al., 2020)(Huang et al., 2020)(Wang et al., 2020)(Holshue et al., 2020)(Wang et al., 2020) . So far, 2019-nCoV has affected more than 43 0 0 0 patients in 28 countries/regions and has became a major global health concern ( https: //www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/ 20200211-sitrep-22-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9 _ 4 ). On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019-nCoV: coronavirus disease (COVID- (Lee et al., 2019). Regarding the virus itself, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the previously provisionally named 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) . Although early studies reported a link between a single local fish and wild animal market and most cases of infection, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission, studies have increasingly demonstrated human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through droplets or direct contact (Anon, n.d.) . Moreover, according to one study, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 41% of patients (Wang et al., 2020) . Based on the evidence of a rapidly increasing incidence of infections (Zhao et al., 2019) and the possibility of transmission by asymptomatic carriers (Biscayart et al., 2019) , SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted effectively among humans and exhibits high potential https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105924 0924-8579/© 2020 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy. All rights reserved. for a pandemic (Anon, n.d.) . In addition to the high transmission efficiency of SARS-CoV-2, the advancement and convenience of global travel could further enhance its worldwide spread (Biscayart et al., 2019) . On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern, following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (Anon, n.d.) and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019). Therefore, health workers, governments and the public need to co-operate globally to prevent its spread (Yoo, 2020) . In addition to seasonal influenza, reported pathogens of pneumonia include adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus A/B (Lee et al., 2019)(Chou et al., 2019)(Lee et al., 2019)(Su et al., 2019) . Moreover, these viruses can cause co-infection in the setting of communityacquired bacterial pneumonia (Chou et al., 2019)(Lee et al., 2019)(Su et al., 2019) . Using molecular methods, knowledge about the role of these viruses in the setting of pneumonia has achieved significant advancements (Lee et al., 2019)(Hung et al., 2019)(Lin et al., 2014) . SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus (Chan et al., 2020)(Lu et al., 2020)(Zhu et al., 2019) . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related (88-89% similarity) to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, namely bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession no. MG772933.1 ) and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank accession no. MG772934.1 ), but it is more distant from SARS-CoV (~79% similarity) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (~50% similarity) (Anon, n.d.) . Chen et al . applied an RNA-based metagenomic nextgeneration sequencing approach to identify a human coronavirus from two pneumonia cases during the Wuhan outbreak in 2019 (Chen et al., 2020) . Its entire genome was 29 881 bp in length (Chen et al., 2020) . Phylogenetic analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the coronavirus circulating in Rhinolophus (horseshoe bats), with 98.7% nucleotide similarity to the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp ) gene of the bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546 , 370 bp sequence of RdRp ) and 87.9% nucleotide similarity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S and N genes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely a novel coronavirus that was independently introduced from animals to humans (Chen et al., 2020) . Based on the findings of genomic investigations and the presence of some bats and live animals in the seafood market in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats or bat droppings associated with contaminated materials in the market or surrounding region (Anon, n.d.) . Based on observations of data from the early outbreak in mainland China from 10-24 January 2020, the trend of an increasing incidence largely follows exponential growth, and the mean basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) was estimated to range from 2.24 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-2.55] to 3.58 (95% CI 2.89-4.39), associated with two-to eight-fold increases in the reporting rate (Zhao et al., 2019) . Another estimation based on data from 31 December 2019 to 28 January 2020 suggested similar findings, with the R 0 for COVID-19 being 2.68 [95% credible interval (CrI) 2.47-2.86] and the epidemic doubling time being 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.8-7.1 days) (Wu et al., 2020) . The current estimate of the mean incubation period for COVID-19 is 6.4 days, ranging from 2.1 days to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) (Backer et al., 2020) , with potential asymptomatic transmission. Although the situation is evolving and further updated data are required to confirm these estimations, there is great potential for a large outbreak of COVID-19 soon. As of 11 February 2020, data from the WHO showed that there were a total of 43 103 cases of COVID-19 ( Figs 1 and 2 ) ( https: //www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/ 20200211-sitrep-22-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9 _ 4 ). There has been a steady rise in the daily total number of COVID-19 cases globally, both within and outside China ( Fig. 1 ). Regarding new cases of COVID-19, a declining trend was found globally ( Fig. 2 A), in China but not outside China ( Fig. 2 B), mainly in international conveyance (Japan) on 11 February 2020. Twenty-eight countries/regions have reported confirmed cases, including mainland China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, the USA, Macao SAR, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, France, the Philippines, the UK, Italy, India, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Nepal, Spain and Belgium. China has had the largest number of patients with COVID-19 ( n = 42 690), followed by Singapore ( n = 45) ( Fig. 3 A). Asia has had most of the reported cases, followed by Europe, North America and Australia, but no cases have been reported in Africa. Within China, Hubei has endured the largest number of infected patients ( n = 31 728), followed by Guangdong ( n = 1177), Zhejiang ( n = 1117) and Henan ( n = 1105) ( Fig. 3 B). A total of 1017 mortalities have been reported globally, with only 2 mortalities occurring outside of mainland China, one each in Hong Kong SAR and the Philippines. According to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control ( https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En ), as of 12 February 2020 there were 45 167 cases of COVID-19 reported from 28 countries/region and 1115 (2.5%) of patients had died. Among the 45 167 cases, most were found in mainland China ( n = 44 653) and the reported mortality was 2.5% ( n = 1113). As of 10 February 2020, only three relatively large-scale case studies have thoroughly demonstrated the clinical features of patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia) in Wuhan (Anon, n.d.) . Herein, we summarise the clinical manifestations of the 278 pooled patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which is also referred to as novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia ( Table 1 ). All of the patients were adults older than 18 years of age, and males comprised 61.9% of the patients ( n = 172). A recent study in Beijing reported that 2 of the 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were children aged between 2-15 years (Chang et al., 2020) . As of 10 February 2020, more than 20 paediatric cases have been reported in China, 10 of whom were identified in Zhejiang Province and were in the age range of 112 days to 17 years (Chen et al., 2020) . Among adult patients, cardiovascular disease and hypertension were the most common underlying diseases, followed by diabetes mellitus. Fever was the most common symptom (92.8%; n = 258), followed by cough (69.8%; n = 194), dyspnoea (34.5%; n = 96), myalgia (27.7%; n = 77), headache (7.2%; n = 20) and diarrhoea (6.1%; n = 17). Rhinorrhoea was noted in only 4.0% (Chen et al., 2020) , a sore throat in 5.1% (Chen et al., 2020) and pharyngalgia in 17.4% (Wang et al., 2020) of patients with relevant clinical information. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count, but 56.8% ( n = 158) of patients had leukopenia. In one study, patients requiring intensive care were significantly older and more likely to have underlying diseases (Wang et al., 2020) , but another study showed different findings (Huang et al., 2020) . According to two studies, patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were more likely to have dyspnoea than non-ICU patients (Anon, n.d.) . Among the 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia reported in Beijing, 12 (92.3%) had fever with a mean duration of 1.6 days before hospitalisation (Chang et al., 2020) . Other symptoms included cough (46.3%), upper airway congestion (61.5%), myalgia (23.1%) and headache (23.1%) (Chang et al., 2020) . Although some of the epidemiological characteristics were identified, considerable uncertainties are still present and additional studies are needed with detailed information from confirmed cases (Ryu & Chun, 2020) . Radiological findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are variable. More than 75% of patients presented with bilateral lung involvement (Anon, n.d.) , and multilobe involvement was also common (71%) (Chung et al., 2020) . Ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the most common finding from chest computed tomography (CT) (Anon, n.d.) , and in a series of 21 patients, 86% had GGO on chest CT and 29% showed consolidation (Chung et al., 2020) . Approximately one-third of patients showed a peripheral distribution of GGO. In contrast, no discrete nodules, cavitation, pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy were observed on the chest CT images (Anon, n.d.) . Another study including 51 cases showed similar findings (Song et al., 2020) : most CT images showed pure GGO (77%), followed by GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening (75%), GGO with consolidation (59%) and pure consolidation (55%). Of the 51 cases, 86% showed bilateral lung involvement, and the above findings were peripherally distributed in 86% of cases (Song et al., 2020) . According to recent reports (Anon, n.d.) , > 85% of patients received antiviral agents, including oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h orally), ganciclovir (0.25 g every 12 h intravenously) and lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (40 0/10 0 mg twice daily orally). Empirical antibiotics were prescribed for 90% of patients in three reports (Anon, n.d.) , and according to one study 15 patients (15%) received antifungal agents (Chen et al., 2020) . Five cases (5.1%) of bacterial ( n = 1) or Candida ( n = 4) coinfections were reported among 99 patients in one study (Chen et al., 2020) , and 4 cases (9.8%) of secondary bacterial infections were reported in another study of 41 patients (Huang et al., 2020) ( Table 2 ). Although intravenous immunoglobulin and systemic steroids have been used in several reports (Anon, n.d.) , their efficacy and associated adverse effects remain unclear. So far, there has been no effective treatment of COVID-19. Several potential drug candidates, including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra R ), nucleoside analogues, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir (Arbidol R ), DNA synthesis inhibitors (such as tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine), chloroquine and Chinese traditional medicines (such as ShuFeng JieDu or Lianhua Qingwen capsules), have been proposed (Anon, n.d.) . In addition, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-based peptide, 3CLpro inhibitor (3CLpro-1) and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor, theoretically, appear to show potential for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Liu et al., 2020) . Chloroquine has been well described with in vitro effects on inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of posttranslational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation in many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Rolain et al., 2007) . Preliminary in vivo clinical studies suggest that chloroquine alone or in combination with antiretroviral agents might play an interesting role in treating HIV infection (Rolain et al., 2007) . A recent study by Wang et al. revealed that remdesivir and chloroquine were highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV in vitro (Wang et al., 2020) . In addition to the one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a promising clinical response to remdesivir (Holshue et al., 2020) and two clinical trials in China, further case-controlled clinical studies of remdesivir therapy are warranted to verify its therapeutic efficacy. In the three pooled studies of 278 patients (Anon, n.d.) , 72 patients (25.9%) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia required ICU admission, 56 (20.1%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 23 (8.3%) and 9 (3.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia, respectively ( Table 2 ). Shock was observed in 19 patients (6.8%), acute kidney injury in 11 patients (4.0%) and continuous renal replacement therapy was required in 14 patients (5.0%). Acute cardiac injury was reported in 5 patients (12.2%) in one study (Huang et al., 2020) and 10 patients (7.2%) in another study (Wang et al., 2020) . Although two earlier studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was associated with high mortality rates of 11.1% ( n = 11) (Chen et al., 2020) and 14.6% ( n = 6) (Huang et al., 2020) , one recent study showed a mortality rate of 4.3% ( n = 6) (Wang et al., 2020) ( Table 2 ). Among 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia outside of Wuhan, as of 4 February 2020 all of the patients recovered but 12 were still being quarantined in hospital in Beijing (Chang et al., 2020) . It might be suggested that the real-world mortality rate may be lower than that reported in a few published clinical series, when clinical data from more systematic testing would be available, and as the ratio between fatality cases and total reported cases of COVID-19 on 12 February 2020 was currently 0.025 (mortality rate 2.5%). However, most deaths developed in male and elderly patients (Anon, n.d.) . The median number of days from the appearance of the first symptom to death was 14 days, and it was significantly shorter among patients aged ≥70 years (11.5 days) compared with those aged < 70 years (20 days) ( P = 0.033) (Wang et al., 2020) . To decrease the damage associated with COVID-19, public health and infection control measures are urgently required to limit the global spread of the virus (Song et al., 2020) . Experience from the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia strongly highlighted that travel history, rather than chest radiography, is of paramount importance for early detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia cases (Kim et al., 2020) . It is essential to limit human-to-human transmission in order to reduce secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers and to prevent transmission amplification events and further international spread from China. Based on previous experience of management of MERS and SARS infections, the WHO recommend infection control interventions to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections, including avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequent hand-washing especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment, and avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. Moreover, people with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette, which is to maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands, and within healthcare facilities enhanced standard infection prevention and control practices are recommended in hospitals, especially in emergency departments (Anon, 2020) . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established interim clinical guidance for the COVID-19 outbreak to implement aggressive measures to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA (Patel & Jernigan, 2019) . These measures include identification of cases and their contacts in the USA as well as appropriate assessment and care of travellers arriving from mainland China to the USA (Patel & Jernigan, 2019) . All effort s are being made to slow the spread of the illness in order to provide time to better prepare healthcare systems and the general public, to better characterise COVID-19 to guide public-health recommendations, and to develop timely diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines (Patel & Jernigan, 2019) . Finally, although the improvement of internet communication largely enhances the availability and dissemination of knowledge, the internet also has the potential for the development and spread of misinformation or fake news. Governments should be responsible for providing accurate knowledge and clarifying misinformation to help the public face this novel infection. Despite the whole world's effort s to underst and COVID-19, many issues remain unclear. First, one report has demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patient stools (Holshue et al., 2020) . However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the faecal-oral route remains unclear. Second, previous studies showed that SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses could survive on environmental surfaces and inanimate objects (Anon, n.d.) ; however, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment has not been reported. Previous studies have shown that coronaviruses could be efficiently inactivated using surface disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min, but other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate were less effective (Kampf et al., 2020) . However, current investigation of the efficacy of commonly used disinfection agents against SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Third, although travel restriction was exerted in many countries, whether this intervention was effective is unclear. Fourth, although one case responded well to remdesivir (Holshue et al., 2020) and one in vitro study (Wang et al., 2020) showed that remdesivir and chloroquine were promising for the treatment of COVID-19, further clinical trials on the effectiveness of remdesivir and chloroquine for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia should be conducted. Fifth, although several studies have reported the clinical features of COVID-19 (Anon, n.d.) , all of the patients had pneumonia and were treated in Wuhan and Beijing. Most recently, an article has described 1099 patients with acute respiratory disease (ARD) caused by SARS-CoV-2 treated at 552 hospitals across 31 provinces/provincial municipalities in China (Anon, 2020) . The article reported that only 43.8% of patients had a initial presentation of fever, and severe pneumonia occurred in 15.7% of cases. The study indicated the median incubation period to be 3.0 days (range, 0-24.0 days) and the fatality rate to be only 1.36% (Anon, 2020) . However, further evaluation of the content of the above report is warranted to clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic carriers and of ARD and pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Finally, although 32.4% ( n = 90) of the reported 278 cases with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia received systemic steroid therapy (Anon, n.d.) , a study on the temporal features of the SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory response in relation to the timing of therapeutic interventions is lacking. Previous experiences of systemic steroids in the treatment of coronavirus-related infections, such as SARS and MERS, showed disappointing results. In the interim, clinical use of glucocorticoids to control SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with the intention of regulating cytokine production and the inflammatory response and avoiding lung injury should be avoided (Anon, n.d.) . The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a clinical threat to the general population and healthcare workers worldwide. However, knowledge about this novel virus remains limited. The effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under evaluation and development. What we can do now is aggressively implement infection control measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 via human-to-human transmission. Public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation, as the more we learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreaks, the better we can respond.

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.",

    "title": "Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia",
    "full_text": "Since December 2019, an increasing number of cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) have been identified in Wuhan, a large city of 11 million people in central China. (Anon, 2019)(Tan et al., 2019)(Zhu et al., 2019) On December 29, 2019, the first 4 cases reported, all linked to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market, were identified by local hospitals using a surveillance mechanism for \"pneumonia of unknown etiology\" that was established in the wake of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak with the aim of allowing timely identification of novel pathogens such as 2019-nCoV. (Xiang et al., 2004) In recent days, infections have been identified in other Chinese cities and in more than a dozen countries around the world. (Munster et al., 2020) Here, we provide an analysis of data on the first 425 laboratory-confirmed cases in Wuhan to describe the epidemiologic characteristics and transmission dynamics of NCIP. The earliest cases were identified through the \"pneumonia of unknown etiology\" surveillance mechanism. (Xiang et al., 2004) Pneumonia of unknown etiology is defined as an illness without a causative pathogen identified that fulfills the following criteria: fever (≥38°C), radiographic evidence of pneumonia, low or normal white-cell count or low lymphocyte count, and no symptomatic improvement after antimicrobial treatment for 3 to 5 days following standard clinical guidelines. In response to the identification of pneumonia cases and in an effort to increase the sensitivity for early detection, we developed a tailored surveillance protocol to identify potential cases on January 3, 2020, using the case definitions described below. (Anon, 2019) Once a suspected case was identified, the joint field epidemiology team comprising members from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) together with provincial, local municipal CDCs and prefecture CDCs would be informed to initiate detailed field investigations and collect respiratory specimens for centralized testing at the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, in Beijing. A joint team comprising staff from China CDC and local CDCs conducted detailed field investigations for all suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases. Data were collected onto standardized forms through interviews of infected persons, relatives, close contacts, and health care workers. We collected information on the dates of illness onset, visits to clinical facilities, hospitalization, and clinical outcomes. Epidemiologic data were collected through interviews and field reports. Investigators interviewed each patient with infection and their relatives, where necessary, to determine exposure histories during the 2 weeks before the illness onset, including the dates, times, frequency, and patterns of exposures to any wild animals, especially those purportedly available in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, or exposures to any relevant environments such as that specific market or other wet markets. Information about contact with others with similar symptoms was also included. All epidemiologic information collected during field investigations, including exposure history, timelines of events, and close contact identification, was cross-checked with information from multiple sources. Households and places known to have been visited by the patients in the 2 weeks before the onset of illness were also investigated to assess for possible animal and environmental exposures. Data were entered into a central database, in duplicate, and were verified with EpiData software (EpiData Association). The initial working case definitions for suspected NCIP were based on the SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) case definitions, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2003 and 2012. (Anon, 2004)(Anon, 2017)(Azhar et al., 2014) A suspected NCIP case was defined as a pneumonia that either fulfilled all the following four criteriafever, with or without recorded temperature; radiographic evidence of pneumonia; low or normal white-cell count or low lymphocyte count; and no reduction in symptoms after antimicrobial treatment for 3 days, following standard clinical guidelines -or fulfilled the abovementioned first three criteria and had an epidemiologic link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or contact with other patients with similar symptoms. The epidemiologic criteria to define a suspected case were updated on January 18, 2020, once new information on identified cases became available. The criteria were the following: a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

Early Tr ansmission Dynamics of NCIP patients from Wuhan who had fever or respiratory symptoms, within 14 days before illness onset. (Anon, n.d.) A confirmed case was defined as a case with respiratory specimens that tested positive for the 2019-nCoV by at least one of the following three methods: isolation of 2019-nCoV or at least two positive results by real-time reversetranscription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for 2019-nCoV or a genetic sequence that matches 2019-nCoV. The 2019-nCoV laboratory test assays were based on the previous WHO recommendation. (Anon, 2020) Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were obtained from patients. RNA was extracted and tested by real-time RT-PCR with 2019-nCoV-specific primers and probes. Tests were carried out in biosafety level 2 facilities at the Hubei (provincial) CDC and then at the National Institute for Viral Disease Control at China CDC. If two targets (open reading frame 1a or 1b, nucleocapsid protein) tested positive by specific real-time RT-PCR, the case would be considered to be laboratory-confirmed. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting. If the repeated Ct-value was less than 40 and an obvious peak was observed, or if the repeated Ct-value was less than 37, the retest was deemed positive. The genome was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from the patient by one of three methods: Sanger sequencing, Illumina sequencing, or nanopore sequencing. Respiratory specimens were inoculated in cells for viral isolation in enhanced biosafety laboratory 3 facilities at the China CDC. (Zhu et al., 2019) The epidemic curve was constructed by date of illness onset, and key dates relating to epidemic identification and control measures were overlaid to aid interpretation. Case characteristics were described, including demographic characteristics, exposures, and health care worker status. The incubation period distribution (i.e., the time delay from infection to illness onset) was estimated by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on exposure histories and onset dates in a subset of cases with detailed information avail-able. Onset-to-first-medical-visit and onset-toadmission distributions were estimated by fitting a Weibull distribution on the dates of illness onset, first medical visit, and hospital admission in a subset of cases with detailed information available. We fitted a gamma distribution to data from cluster investigations to estimate the serial interval distribution, defined as the delay between illness onset dates in successive cases in chains of transmission. We estimated the epidemic growth rate by analyzing data on the cases with illness onset between December 10 and January 4, because we expected the proportion of infections identified would increase soon after the formal announcement of the outbreak in Wuhan on December 31. We fitted a transmission model (formulated with the use of renewal equations) with zoonotic infections to onset dates that were not linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and we used this model to derive the epidemic growth rate, the epidemic doubling time, and the basic reproductive number (R 0 ), which is defined as the expected number of additional cases that one case will generate, on average, over the course of its infectious period in an otherwise uninfected population. We used an informative prior distribution for the serial interval based on the serial interval of SARS with a mean of 8.4 and a standard deviation of 3.8. (Lipsitch et al., 2003) Analyses of the incubation period, serial interval, growth rate, and R 0 were performed with the use of MATLAB software (MathWorks). Other analyses were performed with the use of SAS software (SAS Institute) and R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Data collection and analysis of cases and close contacts were determined by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to be part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation and were thus considered exempt from institutional review board approval. The development of the epidemic follows an exponential growth in cases, and a decline in the most recent days is likely to be due to underascertainment of cases with recent onset and delayed identification and reporting rather than The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

Specifically, the latter part of the curve does not indicate a decrease in the number of incident cases but is due to delayed case ascertainment at the cutoff date. Care should be taken in interpreting the speed of growth in cases in January, given an increase in the availability and use of testing kits as time has progressed. The majority of the earliest cases included reported exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but there was an exponential increase in the number of nonlinked cases beginning in late December. The median age of the patients was 59 years (range, 15 to 89), and 240 of the 425 patients (56%) were male. There were no cases in children below 15 years of age. We examined char-acteristics of cases in three time periods: the first period was for patients with illness onset before January 1, which was the date the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was closed; the second period was for those with onset between January 1 and January 11, which was the date when RT-PCR reagents were provided to Wuhan; and the third period was those with illness onset on or after January 12 (Table 1). The patients with earlier onset were slightly younger, more likely to be male, and much more likely to report exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The proportion of cases in health care workers gradually increased across the three periods (Table 1). We examined data on exposures among 10 confirmed cases, and we estimated the mean No. of Cases 45 50 35 40 30 25 15 10 20 5 0 27 30 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 Nov. Dec. Jan.

We obtained information on 5 clusters of cases, shown in Figure 3. On the basis of the dates of illness onset of 6 pairs of cases in these clusters, we estimated that the serial interval distribution had a mean (±SD) of 7.5±3.4 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19) (Fig. 2B). In the epidemic curve up to January 4, 2020, the epidemic growth rate was 0.10 per day (95% CI, 0.050 to 0.16) and the doubling time was 7.4 days (95% CI, 4.2 to 14). Using the serial interval distribution above, we estimated that R 0 was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). The duration from illness onset to first medical visit for 45 patients with illness onset before January 1 was estimated to have a mean of 5.8 days (95% CI, 4.3 to 7.5), which was similar to that for 207 patients with illness onset between January 1 and January 11, with a mean of 4.6 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.1) (Fig. 2C). The mean duration from onset to hospital admission was estimated to be 12.5 days (95% CI, 10.3 to 14.8) among 44 cases with illness onset before January 1, which was longer than that among 189 patients with illness onset between January 1 and 11 (mean, 9.1 days; 95% CI, 8.6 to 9.7) (Fig. 2D). We did not plot these distributions for patients with onset on or after January 12, because those with recent onset and longer durations to presentation would not yet have been detected. Here we provide an initial assessment of the transmission dynamics and epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. Although the majority of the earliest cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the patients could have been infected through zoonotic or environmental exposures, it is now clear that human-tohuman transmission has been occurring and that the epidemic has been gradually growing in recent weeks. Our findings provide important parameters for further analyses, including evaluations of the impact of control measures and predictions of the future spread of infection. We estimated an R 0 of approximately 2.2, meaning that on average each patient has been spreading infection to 2.2 other people. In general, an epidemic will increase as long as R 0 is greater than 1, and control measures aim to reduce the reproductive number to less than 1. The Table 1.

R 0 of SARS was estimated to be around 3, (Bauch et al., 2005) and SARS outbreaks were successfully controlled by isolation of patients and careful infection control. (Paules et al., 2020) In the case of NCIP, challenges to control include the apparent presence of many mild infections (Perlman, 2020) and limited resources for isolation of cases and quarantine of their close contacts. Our estimate of R 0 was limited to the period up to January 4 because increases in awareness of the outbreak and greater availability and use of tests in more recent weeks will have increased the proportions of infections ascertained. It is possible that subsequent control measures in Wuhan, and more recently elsewhere in the country as well as overseas, have reduced transmissibility, but the detection of an increasing number of cases in other domestic locations and around the world suggest that the epidemic has contin-ued to increase in size. Although the population quarantine of Wuhan and neighboring cities since January 23 should reduce the exportation of cases to the rest of the country and overseas, it is now a priority to determine whether local transmission at a similar intensity is occurring in other locations. It is notable that few of the early cases occurred in children, and almost half the 425 cases were in adults 60 years of age or older, although our case definition specified severe enough illness to require medical attention, which may vary according to the presence of coexisting conditions. Furthermore, children might be less likely to become infected or, if infected, may show milder symptoms, and either of these situations would account for underrepresentation in the confirmed case count.

Although infections in health care workers have been detected, the proportion has not been as high as during the SARS and MERS outbreaks. (Wit et al., 2016) One of the features of SARS and MERS outbreaks is heterogeneity in transmissibility, and in particular the occurrence of super-spreading events, particularly in hospitals. (Wong et al., 2015) Superspreading events have not yet been identified for NCIP, but they could become a feature as the epidemic progresses. Although delays between the onset of illness and seeking medical attention were generally short, with 27% of patients seeking attention within 2 days after onset, delays to hospitalization were much longer, with 89% of patients not being hospitalized until at least day 5 of illness (Fig. 2). This indicates the difficulty in identifying and isolating cases at an earlier stage of disease. It may be necessary to commit considerable resources to testing in outpatient clinics and emergency departments for proactive case finding, both as part of the containment strategy in locations without local spread yet as well as to permit earlier clinical management of cases. Such an approach would also provide important information on the subclinical infections for a better assessment of severity. Our preliminary estimate of the incubation period distribution provides important evidence to support a 14-day medical observation period or quarantine for exposed persons. Our estimate was based on information from 10 cases and is somewhat imprecise; it would be important for Numbers in boxes are calendar dates in December 2019 and January 2020. Data from the 5 secondary cases (patients who had clear exposure to only one index case and had no other potential source of infection) were used to estimate the serial interval distribution. The first four clusters were identified in Wuhan, and the fifth cluster was identified in Huanggang. Case 2.1. F62 index 3 Onset Case 2.2.

When more data become available on epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP, a detailed comparison with the corresponding characteristics of SARS and MERS, as well as the four coronaviruses endemic in humans, would be informative. Our study suffers from the usual limitations of initial investigations of infections with an emerging novel pathogen, particularly during the earliest phase, when little is known about any aspect of the outbreak and there is a lack of diagnostic reagents. To increase the sensitivity for early detection and diagnosis, epidemiology history was considered in the case identification and has been continually modified once more information has become available. Confirmed cases could more easily be identified after the PCR diagnostic reagents were made available to Wuhan on January 11, which helped us shorten the time for case confirmation. Furthermore, the initial focus of case detection was on patients with pneumonia, but we now understand that some patients can present with gastrointestinal symptoms, and an asymptomatic infection in a child has also been reported. (Chan et al., 2020) Early infections with atypical presentations may have been missed, and it is likely that infections of mild clinical severity have been under-ascertained among the confirmed cases. (Wu et al., 2020) We did not have detailed information on disease severity for inclusion in this analysis. In conclusion, we found that cases of NCIP have been doubling in size approximately every 7.4 days in Wuhan at this stage. Human-to-human transmission among close contacts has occurred since the middle of December and spread out gradually within a month after that. Urgent next steps include identifying the most effective control measures to reduce transmission in the community. The working case definitions may need to be refined as more is learned about the epidemiologic characteristics and outbreak dynamics. The characteristics of cases should continue to be monitored to identify any changes in epidemiology -for example, increases in infections among persons in younger age groups or health care workers. Future studies could include forecasts of the epidemic dynamics and special studies of person-to-person transmission in households or other locations, and serosurveys to determine the incidence of the subclinical infections would be valuable. (Perlman, 2020) These initial inferences have been made on a \"line list\" that includes detailed individual information on each confirmed case, but there may soon be too many cases to sustain this approach to surveillance, and other approaches may be required.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.",

We found limited evidence of human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV from familial cluster, no published reports about the transmission dynamics. We reported the transmission dynamics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) indicated by reproductive number (R), and found that 2019-nCoV may have a severer transmissibility than SARS-CoV. A decrease in the R values and periods from onset of symptoms to isolation during the spread of 2019-nCoV indicates the effectiveness of rigorous measures and actions that were conducted by China. Our findings indicate that more rigorous control and prevention measures on early detection, diagnosis and treatment of cases infected with 2019-nCoV are needed to contain its further spread, including shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, effective contact tracing, quarantine and isolation of exposed persons, wearing respirator in the public, and reducing gathering activities and population mobility. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

(Anon, 2002) On January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causing human pneumonia infection was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. (Anon, 2020)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2020) As of January 24, 2020, the virus had spread to 29 provinces, regions and municipal cities across China. A total of 1965 suspected cases and 1287 confirmed cases with 41 fatality had been reported. (Anon, 2020) With the cases spread widely in China, more and more cases were detected from medical staff and persons without exposure history of wildlife or visiting Wuhan within 14 days prior to the onset of illness, it is very evident that 2019-nCoV can spread fast between persons. (Anon, 2020) However, a series of epidemiological parameters such as the incubation period, the humanto-human transmissibility as well as the time period from onset of symptoms to isolation are unclear. Understanding these parameters is critical to predict the trend of 2019-nCoV outbreak, as well as guide clinical management and prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In the study, we examined the incubation period, reproductive number (R) and the period from onset of symptoms to isolation using confirmed 2019-nCoV cases data, and further compared them with that of SARS-CoV. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The copyright holder for this this version posted January 26, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787 doi: bioRxiv preprint Data on confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV were collected as of January 23, 2020, including the date of exposure, symptom onset, and diagnosis. For the cases reported in Guangdong Province, China, the data were obtained from medical records and epidemiological investigations. For the cases reported in other regions of China or other countries, we extracted related information from official websites. We also collected the number of daily cases of SARS from November 16, 2002 to June 3, 2003 in Guangdong Province, China, which was provided by Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (GDCDC). The basic reproductive number (R0) refers to the expected number of secondary infectious cases produced by a typical index case in an entirely susceptible population, which is a key indicator of transmissibility. When infection is spreading in a population, effective reproductive number (R) is more commonly used to describe transmissibility, which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by per infectious case. In the absence of control measures, R = R0χ, where χ is the proportion of the susceptible population. (Lipsitch et al., 2003) R>1 means an increase of the number of cases will occur, while R<1 means the number of cases will decline. In order to calculate the R of 2019-nCoV, we need obtain the generation time (GT), also known as generation interval or series interval, which is defined as the time interval between symptom onset in an index case and symptom onset in a secondary case. (Lipsitch et al., 2003)(Park et al., 2019) Due to limited information on GT from our data, we cannot calculate the GT of 2019-nCoV. So, we applied the GT of SARS in a previous study as the GT of 2019-nCoV (GT=8.4 days, SD=3.8 days). (Wallinga & Teunis, 2004) preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

As R value varied in different phase of an epidemic, in order to compare with the R of SARS-CoV, we further estimated the R value of SARS-CoV using the data in the early phase (December 26, 2002 to January 23, 2003) of the SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province. During the early phase of a disease epidemic, the reproductive rate was considered to be linked to exponential growth rate, (Wallinga & Lipsitch, 1609) which was defined by the per capita change in number of new cases per unit of time. We used Poisson regression to fit the exponential growth rate, since the daily incidence data are integer. The estimation of reproductive number was described as: where M denotes the moment generating function of the generation time distribution, and r denotes the fitted exponential growth rate. The maximum likelihood estimation is a common method for calculating R based on surveillance data during a disease epidemic, and it relies on the assumption that the secondary cases infected by an index case were Poisson distribution with expected value R. (White & Pagano, 2008) Therefore, R can be estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood, as: (2-1) Where Nt denotes the number of symptoms onset cases observed on day t, w denotes the generation time distribution. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The Rt is particularly useful for monitoring epidemic trends, identifying \"super-spreader events,\" measuring progress of interventions over time, as well as providing parameters for mathematical models. Based on previous studies, (Wallinga & Teunis, 2004) we calculated Rt by averaging all transmission networks compatible with observations per two days, using the following equation: (3-1) Where pij denotes the probability that case i with symptom onset at time ti was infected by case j with onset at time tj, Rj denotes the effective reproduction number for case j, and Rt average all cases with same date of symptom onset. The confidence interval (CI) for Rt can be obtained by simulation. We applied frequency and percentages (%) to describe categorical variables, and used mean±SD to describe the continuous variables. Given that a great number of cases only had the data of the arrival and departure time of Wuhan rather than the exact time of exposure to 2019-nCoV, the incubation period was calculated as follow: (1) in order to get a relatively precise exposure time, we selected the cases (n=16) who had traveled to Wuhan and stayed for no more than three days; (2) for each case, the max/min potential incubation period was estimated as date of the symptoms minus the arrival/departure date of Wuhan, and then average them to get the incubation time; (3) the incubation time was the mean incubation time of the cases included.

A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantify the effect of parameters changes on R value. We changed the shape parameter of Weibull distribution from 7.5 to 9.5 days.

The average period from onset of symptoms to isolation in all cases was 2.9±3.0 days (Figure 3A), and decreased from 6.7 days in cases before January 9, to 0.7 days in cases after January 19 (Figure 3B). The average period from onset to isolation was 4.2±3.7 days in SARS cases. The R values of 2019-nCoV as of January 23 were 2.90 (95%CI: 2.32-3.63) and 2.92 (95%CI: 2.28-3.67) estimated by EG and ML, respectively. The temporal distribution of R values showed declining trend from 7.93 (95%CI: 5.00-12.00) to 2.60 (95%CI: 0.57-5.17).

For example, the R estimated by EG method changed from 2.59 (95%CI: 2.12-3.15) using GT=7.5 to 3.35 (95%CI:2.60-4.32) using GT=9.5.

The number of 2019-nCoV cases has increased rapidly in China, and cases have been transmitting to other countries. However, the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV remain unknown, (Bauch et al., 2005) which is not conducive to containing the ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV. In this study, we estimated effective R of 2019-nCoV using 164 confirmed cases, and found that R was around 2.9, which means 2.9 secondary cases generated by an index case of 2019-nCoV. This finding is comparable with that of SARS reported in several previous studies, ranging from 1.1 to 4.2 with most estimates between 2 and 3, (Bauch et al., 2005)(Fraser et al., 2004)(Peak et al., 2017) but much higher than the effective R (1.77) in the early stage of SARS epidemic (period between December, 26 2002 and January 23, 2003) occurred in Guangdong Province. This discrepancy of effective R between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV may be partially explained by transmission patterns. Recent clinical evidence suggests that asymptomatic cases or mild cases could effectively transmit 2019-nCoV, which was different from SARS because most SARS cases were infected by \"super spreaders\", and cases in incubation period and mild cases could not infected susceptible. (Lipsitch et al., 2003) Considering rapid spread across China of the ongoing outbreak, our finding suggests the ongoing 2019-nCoV epidemic may be much higher than SARS. (Parry, 2020) With the outbreaks progress in near future, it is not strange that sustained human-to-human transmission will be observed in communities, even super-spreading events will be seen in high risk places such as hospitals. (Chan et al., 2020) Therefore, more rigorous control and prevention measures need to be strictly implemented.

This finding indicates that rigorous measures of prevention and control taken by Chinese governments are taking into effect. Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, Chinese governments have implemented a series of rigorous strategies and measures to contain the outbreak (Figure S2). For example, as of January 23, a total of 9,507 close contacts were tracked and isolated. This successful management of contacts could effectively contain the further spread of 2019-nCoV across China. More importantly, almost all provinces and regions in China have initiated the highest level of public health emergency response, and epidemic data was released on time through various channels, which could improve the general public to understand the risk of the outbreak, and take voluntary actions to detect, diagnose and treat cases infected 2019-nCoV earlier. This can be verified by decreasing period from onset to isolation from 6.7 days in cases before January 9, to 0.7 days in cases after January 19. This study has some strengths. First, this is the first study, to date, to assess the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV based on confirmed cases. In addition, we compared the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV with SARS. Third, we found measures previously taken by the governments are effective. These results could provide important information for successful control on the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. Our study has several limitations. First, we could not collect all confirmed cases of the outbreak, which may result in bias of our results. Second, some epidemiological information including the dates of illness onset, exposure, and diagnosis were not available for many cases. Third, we are in the early days of this outbreak, and there is much uncertainty in epidemiological parameters that affects transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.

In summary, 2019-nCoV may have a higher pandemic risk than SARS in 2003, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are taking into effect. Our findings indicate that more rigorous control and prevention measures on early detection, diagnosis and treatment of cases infected with 2019-nCoV are needed to contain its further spread, including shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, effective contact tracing, quarantine and isolation of exposed persons, wearing respirator in the public, and reducing gathering activities and population mobility. 2020 Chart A: The global distribution of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.

    "full_text": "The Health Commission of Hubei province, China, first announced a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia on Dec 31, 2019. (Anon, n.d.) 27 patients were initially reported, which was subsequently revised to 41 on Jan 11, 2020, with seven severe cases and one death. 2 Some patients were reported to have radiographic ground-glass lung changes; normal or lower than average white blood cell lymphocyte, and platelet counts; hypoxaemia; and deranged liver and renal function. Most were said to be geographically linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which was subsequently reported by journalists to be selling freshly slaughtered game animals. (Anon, 2020) To date, no evidence of person-to-person transmission or affected health-care workers has been published in the scientific literature. The Chinese health authority said that the patients initially tested negatively for common respiratory viruses and bacteria, but later tested positive for a novel coronavirus. (Anon, n.d.) The virus was soon isolated and its genome sequenced by a number of Chinese scientists. (Anon, 2020) The virus was tentatively named by WHO as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Here, we report the epidemiological, clinical, radiological, laboratory, and genomic findings of a family cluster of five patients in Shenzhen who had a history of travel to Wuhan, and one other family member who has not travelled to Wuhan. On Jan 10, 2020, we initially enrolled two patients who initially presented to The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China) with fever, respiratory symptoms, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs. Subsequently, between Jan 11, and Jan 15, 2020, five other members of this family also pre sented to our hospital for the assessment of their health conditions. We recorded and analysed the history, physical findings, and haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigation results. All laboratory procedures for clinical samples have been previously reported. (To et al., 2010) Briefly, nasopharyngeal and throat swabs and stool and urine samples were taken and put into viral transport media. Plasma was separated from EDTA bottles and serum were separated from clotted blood bottles. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (number [2015]90). We obtained written consent from the patients. Respiratory samples of the patients were tested for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay (GeneXpert System, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. (To et al., 2019) To detect the presence of 18 respiratory virus targets and four bacteria (including adenovirus, coronaviruses [HCoV-229E, HCoV-Nl63, HCoV-Oc43, HCoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV], human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus or entero virus, influenza A viruses [H1, H1-2009 and H3], influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses [types 1 -4], Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae), samples were tested using BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. (Chan et al., 2017) The two faecal samples were taken from the patients who had diarrhoea as part of their symptoms, and the samples were tested by BioFire FilmArray Gastrointestinal panel (bioMérieux) for 22 diarrhoeal pathogens. Reverse transcription was done using the SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) as previously described. (Peiris et al., 2003) The reaction mixture (10 μL) contained 5•5 μL of RNA, 2 μL of 5 × SuperScript IV buffer, 0•5 μL of 100 mM dithiothreitol, 0•5 μL of 10 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) mixture, 0•5 μL of 50 μM random hexamers, 0•5 μL of SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (200 U/μL), and 0•5 μl of RNase-free water. The mixtures were incubated at 23°C for 10 min, followed by 50°C for 10 min and 80°C for 10 min. The PCR mixture (25 μL) contained 1 μL of cDNA, 2•5 μL of 10X PCR buffer II, 2 μL of 25 mM MgCl 2 , 0•5 μL of 10 mM dNTP mix, 2•5 μL of each 10 μM forward and reverse primer, 0•125 μL of AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA; 5 U/μL), and nuclease-free water. The first set of primers was the forward pri mer (5ʹ-CAAGTGGGGTAAGGCTAGACTTT-3ʹ) and the reverse primer (5ʹ-ACTTAGGATAATCCCAACCCAT-3ʹ) targeting 344 bp of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of all severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coro naviruses. The second set of primers was designed after our first 2019-nCoV genome sequence by Nanopore sequencing from Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on Jan 13, 2020, with no starting date limitations, using the terms \"family\", \"pneumonia\", \"Wuhan\", \"coronavirus\", and \"novel\" for articles in English. Our search did not reveal any reports of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan before 2020. We only noted family clusters of pneumonia due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of unexplained pneumonia in a Shenzhen family cluster connected to a Wuhan hospital were presented. The diagnostic tests from relevant clinical samples confirmed the presence of a novel coronavirus in five of six patients with radiological changes of viral pneumonia. The phylogenetic analysis of this novel coronavirus suggested its linkage to a possible animal source. Although this novel coronavirus might have first originated from animals and now jumped into humans, the possibility of person-to-person transmission could not be excluded, as seen in this family cluster with no known history of exposure to markets or animals, and rapid intercity spread might be possible by air travel. Vigilant epidemiological control in the community and health-care facilities is important to prevent another SARS-like epidemic. stayed with patient 7.

Table 1: Summary of clinical features and laboratory results of the family cluster infected with 2019 novel coronavirus, at presentation the positive clinical samples: the forward primer (5ʹ-CCTACTAAATTAAATGATCTCTGCTTTACT-3ʹ) and the reverse primer (5ʹ-CAAGCTATAACGCAGCCTGTA-3ʹ) targeting the 158 bp of Spike (S) gene of this novel coronavirus. These sets were used for PCR using an automated thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) with a hot start at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products with correct target size were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Both strands of PCR products were sequenced with an ABI 3500xl Dx Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using the PCR primers. During the set up of the assays, we initialy used SARS-CoV cDNA as a positive control for RdRp assay and gene-synthesised fragment for Spike assay. Thereafter, diluted samples from positive patients were used as the positive control for both assays. All positive results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A total of 140 µL of respiratory, urine, stool, serum, or plasma samples from each patient was subjected to RNA extraction into 50 µL elutes using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Forward (5ʹ-CCTACTAAATTAAATGATCTCTGCTTTACT-3ʹ) and reverse (5ʹ-CAAGCTATAACGCAGCCTGTA-3ʹ) primers targeting the S gene of this novel coronavirus were used for the assay. Real-time RT-PCR assay was done using QuantiNova SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), as previously described. 9 Each 20 μL reaction mixture contained 10 μL of 2 × QuantiNova SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix, 0•2 μL of QN SYBR Green RT-Mix, 1 μM of each 10 μM forward and reverse primers, and 5 μL of RNA and nuclease-free water. Reactions were incubated at 50°C for 10 min and 95°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s, and then subjected to melting curve analysis (95°C for 5 s, 65°C for 1 min, followed by a gradual increase in temperature to 97°C with continuous recording of fluorescence). Whole-genome sequencing was done using Oxford Nanopore MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) supplemented by Sanger sequencing. RNA was extracted from host cell-depleted nasopharyngeal and sputum samples using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, as described previously. (To et al., 2017)(Woo et al., 2014)(Tse et al., 2012) Whole-genome amplification of the coronavirus was done using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification ap proach, as described previously. (Lewandowski et al., 2019) Bioinformatics analyses were done using an inhouse pipeline. Details on the library preparation and bioinformatics analysis are described in the appendix (pp 1-2). The con sensus sequence of HKU-SZ-002a (accession number MN938384) and HKU-SZ-005b (accession number MN975262) have been deposited into GenBank. Raw reads, after excluding human reads, have been deposited into BioProject (accession number PRJNA601630). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA X software using the RT-PCR amplicons of partial RdRp and S gene regions of the strains detected in this study and other related coro naviruses. (Lau et al., 2015) The trees of the amplicons were constructed using maximum likelihood methods with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 trees, with human coro navirus 229E as outgroup. The phylogenetic tree of the full-length genome was constructed by use of the neighbour-joining method using the Tamura-Nei model with a gamma distribution. The bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 trees and values only greater than 70 were displayed.

The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. The family cluster of six patients (patients 1-6) flew from Shenzhen to Wuhan on Dec 29, 2019, and flew back to Shenzhen on Jan 4, 2020 (figure 1). This travel period overlapped with the time period after the announcement of the first case of Wuhan pneumonia (symptom onset A C B D See Online for appendix Relative 4 made frequent visits to the wet market but not the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which had been implicated by the health authority to be the epidemic centre. Relatives 2-5 have developed fever, cough, and weak ness since Jan 4, 2020. Patients 1 and 3 had visited relative 1, aged 1 year, and the son of relative 2, on Dec 29, 2019, in a Wuhan hospital, who had been treated in hospital for febrile pneumonia (relative 2 accompanied relative 1 in the hospital over night; relative 1 later recovered and was discharged home on Dec 31, 2019). Patient 3, but not patient 1, had worn a surgical mask during the hospital visit. The incubation period was estimated to be between 3 and 6 days. Patients 1-4 were symptomatic, and they only presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. For the two asymptomatic children (patients 5 and 6), patient 5 had ground-glass lung opacities identified by CT scan. Unlike patient 5, who was aged 10 years and non-compliant to parental guidance, patient 6, who was aged 7 years and reported by her mother to wear a surgical mask for most of the time during the period in Wuhan, was not found to be infected by virological or radiological investigations. The blood tests and CT scan of patient 6 were normal. After they returned to Shenzhen on Jan 4, 2020, patients 3-6 stayed in the same household of patient 7 (mother of patient 4) until Jan 11, 2020. Patient 7, who did not go to Wuhan or visit Shenzhen markets in the preceding 14 days, developed back pain and generalised weakness and attended the outpatient clinic at another local hospital on Jan 8, 2020. She was given cefaclor for 3 days with no improvement. She developed fever and dry cough and attended the same outpatient clinic and was treated with intravenous cefazolin (two doses) on Jan 12, 2020. She was admitted to our hospital on Jan 15, 2020, due to persistent symptoms. Of the six patients with pulmonary infiltrates (patients 1-5 and patient 7) on CT scans, three were male and three were female, with ages ranging 10-66 years (table 1). Four had chronic comorbidities and five had history of fever. The three older patients (aged >60 years: patients 1, 2, and 7) had dry cough and generalised weakness. Patient 4 had productive cough. Patients 3 and 4 were younger adults and had diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract symptoms including sore throat, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhoea. Patient 3 also had pleuritic chest pain. Except for patient 4, all six had normal or lower than average total white blood cell counts. The three older patients (patients 1, 2, and 7) all had substantially increased C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Patients 1 and 2 also had lymphopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, and extended activated thromboplastin time. All six patients showed multifocal patchy groundglass opacities, especially around the peripheral parts of the lungs on CT scans, which were compatible with changes seen in viral pneumonia (figure 2).

Table 2: Microbiological findings from clinical specimens collected from the family cluter infected with 2019 novel coronavirus, at presentation changes, or any concomitant radiological changes of dense consoli dation, pleural effu sion, lymphadenopathy, or pneu momediastinum were seen. All respiratory samples were negative on two point-ofcare multiplex PCR systems for 18 respiratory viral and four bacterial targets. The two faecal samples from patients 3 and 4 who had preceding diarrhoea were negative on a multiplex PCR assay for common diarrhoeal viruses, bacteria, and parasites (table 2). The respiratory samples of patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 were positive for both RdRp and S genes by conventional RT-PCR, and for the S gene by real-time RT-PCR, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of all amplicons (appendix pp 3-5). Although the respiratory samples of patient 3 were negative for both RdRp and S gene (collected 9 days after symptom onset), she was still regarded as an infected case because she was strongly epidemiologically linked to the Wuhan hospital exposure and radiologically showing multifocal ground-glass lung opacities. Only the serum sample of patient 2 was positive and all other patients' serum, urine, and faecal samples were negative for this novel coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR products showed that the amplicon sequences of both RdRp and S genes from these five patients were novel (figure 3) and different from other known human or animal coronaviruses, including the SARS and bat SARS-related coronaviruses. Two complete virus genomes (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) were sequenced using Nanopore technology and showed a novel coronavirus that is most closely related to those of the bat SARS-like coronavirus bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (NCBI accession number MG772934) and bat-SL-CoVZC45 (NCBI accession number MG772933). Their genome organisation is typical of a lineage B betacoronavirus. The size of the virus genomes from patient 2 (HKU-SZ-002a) and patient 5 (HKU-SZ-005b) are around 29•8 kilobases with GC content of 38% (appendix p 6). HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b differ from each other by only two bases. One of them is a non-synonymous mutation at amino acid position 336 of non-structural protein 4 (Ser336 for HKU-SZ-002a; Leu336 for HKU-SZ-005b; figure 4). Although amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain of Spike subunit 1 of this novel coronavirus is approximately 66% identical to those of the SARS-related coronaviruses, and the core domain of the receptor binding domain of this novel coronavirus has about 68% amino acid identity with those of the SARS-related coronavirus, the protein sequence of the external subdomain region of receptor binding domain of Spike subunit 1 has only 39% identity, which might affect the choice of human receptor and therefore the biological behaviour of this virus (figure 4). All six patients were admitted to hospital under isolation, supportive care, and remained stable as of Jan 20, 2020. We report here a familial cluster of unexplained pneumonia due to 2019-nCoV. Six of seven family members had radiological changes of viral pneumonia, among whom five ( patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 and 7) had associated symptoms at the time of presentation. Complete genome sequences of the two strains from patients 2 and 5 showed almost complete nucleotide identity with each other, and were closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses reported in 2018. Several possible scenarios of transmission exist. The first and most likely scenario is that one virologically documented patient with pneumonia (patient 1) acquired the infection from a Wuhan hospital while visiting their relative (relative 1) and then patients 1-5 transmitted the virus to patient 7 on returning to Shenzhen. The second scenario is that patients 1-5 have directly acquired the infection from relatives 2-5 and transmitted it to patient 7 on returning to Shenzhen. But this scenario is less likely because patients 1-5 developed symptoms before relatives 2-5. The third scenario is that patients 1-5 acquired the infection from an unknown common source in Wuhan and transmitted it to patient 7 when back in Shenzhen. For the patients' relatives (relatives 2-5), they could have acquired the infection from the hospital or the community, although no virological confirmation was possible and they had no animal contacts, game food, or visits to the Huanan sea food wholesale market. Notably, patient 1 or patient 3 who had visited Wuhan hospital might have been infectious before symptom onset because patient 5 was shedding virus without symp toms. These findings suggested that person-to-person transmission and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV by air travel are possible, supporting reports of infected Chinese travellers from Wuhan being detected in other geographical regions. Many of the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of this novel coronavirus pneumonia were similar to those of SARS patients in 2003. (Peiris et al., 2003)(Peiris et al., 2003)(Cheng et al., 2007) The incubation period of the Wuhan pneumonia appeared similar to that of SARS. The attack rate is rather high, up to 83% if we included the five patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) with unexplained ground-glass radiological changes of the lungs on CT scan as the case definition in this family outbreak after visiting Wuhan. A rather unexpected finding from the lung CT scan of patient 5, which was done on the insistence by the nervous parents, also showed ground-glass pneumonic changes. Patient 5 was later confirmed virologically to have an asymptomatic infection. Although asymptomatic patients with SARS were uncommon, they were documented in our retrospective study in the minor 2004 SARS outbreak after reopening of the wildlife market in Guangzhou. (Che et al., 2006) Notably, patients 3 and 4 were afebrile at presentation to our hospital. These cryptic cases of walking pneumonia might serve as a possible source to propagate the outbreak. Further studies on the epidemiological significance of these asymptomatic cases are warranted. The symptoms of this novel pneumonia were also nonspecific. The three oldest patients in this family with comorbidities had more severe systemic symptoms of generalised weakness and dry cough. As expected, they might have decreased total white blood cell, lymphocyte, or platelet counts, with also extended activated thromboplastin time and increased C-reactive protein level. The multifocal ground-glass changes on lung CT scan were typical of viral pneumonia. Their lung involvement was also more diffuse and extensive than those of the younger patients, whose blood test results were largely normal. Patient 4, who had a history of chronic sinusitis, might have a bacterial superinfection because he had a productive cough instead of a dry cough. He also had a high white blood cell count, although the bacterial test was negative. Interestingly, the two younger adults (patients 3 and 4) initially had diarrhoea, which was also reported in 10•6% (15 of 142) of our SARS patients at presentation; (Cheng et al., 2004) however, the subsequent faecal samples of patients 3 and 4 that were collected 9-10 days after symptom onset were negative for the virus after the diarrhoea had long subsided. Up to 30% of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) also have HKU-SZ-001 refers to the strain detected in the nasopharyngeal swab of patient 1; HKU-SZ-002a refers to strain detected in the nasopharyngeal swab of patient 2; HKU-SZ-002b refers to strain detected in the serum sample of patient 2; HKU-SZ-004 refers to the strain detected in the nasopharyngeal swab of patient 4; HKU-SZ-005 refers to the strain detected in the throat swab of patient 5; HKU-SZ-005b refers to the strain detected in the sputum sample of patient 5; HKU-SZ-007a refers to the strain detected in the nasopharyngeal swab of patient 7; HKU-SZ-007b refers to the strain detected in the throat swab of patient 7; and HKU-SZ-007c refers to the strain detected in the sputum sample of patient 7 (appendix p 6). The NCBI GenBank accession numbers of the genome sequences are MN938384 (HKU-SZ-002a), MN975262 (HKU-SZ-005b), MG772934 (Bat SL-CoV ZXC21), MG772933 (Bat SL-CoV ZC45), AY274119 (hSARS-CoV Tor2), AY278491 (SARS coronavirus HKU-39849), AY278488 (hSARS-CoV BJ01), AY390556 (hSARS-CoV GZ02), AY515512 (Paguma SARS CoV HC/SZ/61/03), KY417146 (Bat SL-CoV Rs4231), KC881005 (Bat SL-CoV RsSHC014), KC881006 (Bat SL-CoV Rs3367), MK211377 (Bat CoV YN2018C), MK211378 (Bat CoV YN2018D), KY417149 (Bat SL-CoV Rs4255), FJ588686 (Bat SL-CoV Rs672), NC014470 (Bat SARS-related CoV BM48-31), EF065513 (Bat CoV HKU9-1), AY391777 (hCoV OC43), NC006577 (hCoV HKU1), NC019843 (hMERS CoV), NC009020 (Bat CoV HKU5-1), NC009019 (Bat CoV HKU4-1), and NC002645 (hCoV 229E). 0•20 100 100 100 100 91 96 100 100 100 100 100 100 88 91 78 73 diarrhoea. (Chan et al., 2015) Sub genomic RNA indicating viral replication was seen in faecal samples of patients with MERS. (Zhou et al., 2017) Moreover, MERS-CoV was shown to survive in simulated fed gastrointestinal juice and the ability to infect intestinal organoid models. (Zhou et al., 2017) Diarrhoea and gastrointestinal involvement are well known in coronavirus infections of animals and humans. (Leung et al., 2003) On microbiological testing, we did not find any evidence of other known respiratory viral or bacterial infections, but specific RT-PCR assays for two widely separated genome targets-the highly conserved RdRp and the highly variable S genes-were positive for this novel 2019-nCoV. Two complete genome sequences of this novel coronavirus were recovered from the naso pharyngeal swab of patient 2 and the sputum sample of patient 5 with an earlier cycle threshold value indicating a higher viral load. Patient 2 had more underlying comorbidities and clinical features and radiological findings of more severe disease than the other patients included here. Moreover, the serum sample of patient 2 was also positive for 2019-nCoV, which might indicate some virus spillover from the more severely infected lung into the systemic circulation, as previously reported in patients with SARS. (Hung et al., 2004) Sputum samples were available for testing from patients 5 and 7. The cycle threshold values of the sputum samples were 8-13 cycles earlier than those of throat swabs, indicating higher viral loads detected in the lower respiratory tract. This finding is consistent with the observations in patients with MERS who had higher viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples than in upper respiratory tract samples. (Memish et al., 2014) Thus, repeat testing of upper respiratory tract samples or testing of lower respiratory tract samples are warranted in clinically suspected cases with an initially negative result in nasopharyngeal or throat swab. Unlike our patients in the 2003 SARS outbreak, (Hung et al., 2004) we found no evidence of viral shedding in urine and faeces in these six patients. However, improved systematic serial collection and testing of an increased number of such samples is warranted. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses, capable of rapid mutation and recombination. They are classified into alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, which both have their gene source from bats and are mainly found in mammals such as bats, rodents, civets, and humans; and gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses, which both have their gene source from birds and are mainly found in birds. (Woo et al., 2005)(Woo et al., 2012)(Lau et al., 2015) Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR amplicon fragments from five of our six patients and the complete virus genome of 29•8 kilobases from patients 2 and 5 showed that the virus is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the lineage B or subgenus sarbecovirus, which also includes the human SARS coronavirus. The genome of our virus strains are phylo genetically closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses first found in the Chinese horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus, captured in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, China, between 2015 and 2017. (Hu et al., 2018) Notably, the first SARS-related coronavirus was also discovered in the R sinicus found in Hong Kong, and central and south China in 2005. (Lau et al., 2005)(Li et al., 2005) The full virus genome had about an 89% nucleotide identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45, which makes it a new species. Moreover, the Spike protein of our virus has an 84% nucleotide identity with the bat-SL-CoVZC45 coronavirus and an 78% nucleotide identity with the human SARS coronavirus. Although substantial genetic differences exist between this and other beta coronaviruses, cross reactions in RT-PCR or antibody assays for SARS or other betacoronaviruses are possible if the primers and antigenic epitopes are not carefully chosen, as previously reported. (Che et al., 2005) Further studies on the optimal diagnostic tests are warranted. In summary, an outbreak of novel coronavirus is ongoing at Wuhan in the winter of 2019-20. Similar to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, Wuhan is also a rapidly flourishing capital city of the Hubei province and the traffic hub of central China. Moreover, both outbreaks were initially connected to wet markets where game animals and meat were sold. In the case of SARS, personto-person transmission was efficient and super-spreading events had led to major outbreaks in hotels and hospitals. Learning from the SARS outbreak, which started as animal-to-human transmission during the first phase of the epidemic, all game meat trades should be optimally regulated to terminate this portal of transmission.

Unlike the 2003 SARS outbreak, the improved surveillance network and laboratory capability of China was able to recognise this outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome sequences that would allow the development of rapid diagnostic tests and efficient epidemiological control. Our study showed that person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospital, and intercity spread of this novel coronavirus are possible, and therefore vigilant control measures are warranted at this early stage of the epidemic. www.thelancet.com Vol 395 February 15, 2020 www.thelancet.com Vol 395 February 15, 2020",

    "abstract": "Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by nextgeneration sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.",

    "title": "Pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan, China: potential for international spread via commercial air travel",
    "full_text": "On 30 December 2019, a report of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology was published on ProMED-mail, possibly related to contact with a seafood market in Wuhan, China. 1 Hospitals in the region held an emergency symposium, and support from federal agencies is reportedly helping to determine the source of infection and causative organism. The seafood market has since been closed, but purportedly sold a variety of live animal species. On 5 January 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a document outlining their request for more information from Chinese public health authorities, and detailed 44 patients had 'pneumonia of unknown aetiology', with 121 close contacts under surveillance (www.who.int/csr/don/ 05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/). The WHO reported that 11 patients were severely ill, and many affected individuals had contact with the Huanan Seafood market. Some patients were reported to have fever, dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. At the time of publication, limited information has been produced directly by Chinese public health authorities; however, media reports documenting interviews with such authorities have stated that the aetiology is not yet identified, that there are now 59 affected patients, and that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), avian influenza and several other common respiratory pathogens have been ruled out (http://news. hebei.com.cn/system/2020/01/05/100154729.shtml). On 8 January 2019, news outlets and ProMED-mail reported that genetic sequencing demonstrated a novel coronavirus as the potential causative organism. 2 Given the recent history of zoonotic transmission of a coronavirus emerging from a live-animal market in China in 2002, and the potential for novel pathogens to rapidly spread globally via commercial air travel, (Findlater & Bogoch, 2018)(Poutanen et al., 2003) we sought to evaluate international travel patterns from Wuhan, China in order to anticipate patterns of disease dispersion should this outbreak evolve. We evaluated 2018 travel data generated from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to quantify passenger volumes originating from the international airport in Wuhan, China, between January and March, inclusive. IATA data accounts for ∼90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, excluding transportation via unscheduled charter flights (the remainder is modelled using market intelligence). These data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We also report Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) scores for countries receiving significant numbers of travellers from Wuhan. (Moore et al., 2017) The IDVI score is a validated tool to estimate a country's capacity to prepare for and manage infectious disease threats. The score is based on metrics from the following seven domains: demographic, health care, public health, disease dynamics, political (domestic), political (international) and economic. Countries are scored between 0 and 1 with higher scores representing greater capacity to respond to outbreaks. (Moore et al., 2017) Table 1 outlines the top 20 destination cities with passengers arriving from Wuhan, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest volumes with 41 080, 23 707, 20 001 and 17 645 arrivals between January and March, respectively. The IDVI for these leading destinations all exceed 0.65. Sydney and Victoria, Australia and Dubai, UAE are the only three cities in the top 20 destinations that are outside of Asia. Bali, Indonesia has the lowest IDVI score (0.563) in the top 20 destination cities. At the time of publication, much is still unknown about this aetiology of this respiratory syndrome. Enhanced surveillance at airports has been enacted in several Asian cities. There are now reports of respiratory illnesses in travellers from Wuhan under investigation in Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul; however, to date these illnesses are not confirmed to be related to the Wuhan outbreak. Public health agencies around the world are reminding frontline healthcare providers to be vigilant for potential imported cases; however, this may be complicated in the northern hemisphere by high levels of influenza-like illnesses at this time of year. To our knowledge, no advisories against travel to Wuhan have been issued. Fortunately, most countries receiving the largest volumes of passengers from Wuhan, China appear to have high IDVI scores, corresponding to relatively strong public health and healthcare capacity. Seventeen years after the global SARS epidemic, the current outbreak in Wuhan, China serves as a reminder of how rapidly novel pathogens can appear and spread with potentially serious global consequences. Although it is unclear what the current burden of disease is or the potential for human-to-human transmission, major Asian hubs are the most probable sites of exportation should this epidemic continue, and public health officials are already on alert in those locations. * 2018 estimates (The UN). * * IDVI value estimated for China. * * * IATA data between January and March 2018, inclusive.

    "full_text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positivesense RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales and broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. (Anon, n.d.) Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the two betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ksiazek et al., 2003)(Kuiken et al., 2003)(Drosten et al., 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), (Groot et al., 2013)(Anon, n.d.) have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2019) The coronaviruses already identified might only be the tip of the iceberg, with potentially more novel and severe zoonotic events to be revealed. In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia. (Anon, n.d.) Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Thus far, more than 800 confirmed cases, including in health-care workers, have been identified in Wuhan, and several exported cases have been confirmed in other provinces in China, and in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the USA. (Anon, 2020)(Anon, 2020)(Anon, 2020)(Anon, 2020) Following the pneumonia cases of unknown cause reported in Wuhan and considering the shared history of exposure to Huanan seafood market across the patients, an epidemiological alert was released by the local health authority on Dec 31, 2019, and the market was shut down on Jan 1, 2020. Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. An expert team of physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, and government officials was soon formed after the alert. Since the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yintan Hospital (Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Local centres for disease control and prevention collected respiratory, blood, and faeces specimens, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen (NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Mérieux Laboratory, Beijing, China). A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that. (Anon, 2019) Of 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. The presence of 2019-nCoV in respi ratory specimens was detected by nextgeneration se quencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. The primers and probe target to envelope gene of CoV were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer 5′-ACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCAGCAGTACGCACACAATC-3′; and the probe 5′CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3′BHQ1. Conditions for the amplifications were 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s. Initial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed. Given the emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases during the influenza season, antibiotics (orally and intravenously) and osel tamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) were empirically administered. Corticosteroid therapy Evidence before this study Human coronaviruses, including hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, cause mild respiratory diseases. Fatal coronavirus infections that have emerged in the past two decades are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published up to Jan 11, 2020, using the keywords \"novel coronovirus\", \"2019 novel coronavirus\", or \"2019-nCoV\". No published work about the human infection caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) could be identified. We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 41 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with 2019-nCoV. 27 (66%) of 41 patients had a history of direct exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The median age of patients was 49•0 years (IQR 41•0-58•0), and 13 (32%) patients had underlying disease. All patients had pneumonia. A third of patients were admitted to intensive care units, and six died. High concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of critically ill patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Implications of all the available evidence 2019-nCoV caused clusters of fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling SARS-CoV. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, have a high likelihood of admission to intensive care, and might die. The cytokine storm could be associated with disease severity. More efforts should be made to know the whole spectrum and pathophysiology of the new disease. (methylprednisolone 40-120 mg per day) was given as a combined regimen if severe community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed by physicians at the designated hospital. Oxygen support (eg, nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) was administered to patients according to the severity of hypoxaemia. Repeated tests for 2019-nCoV were done in patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection to show viral clearance before hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation. We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays for all patients with laboratoryconfirmed 2019-nCoV infection who were reported by the local health authority. The admission data of these patients was from Dec 16, 2019, to Jan 2, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardised data collection forms (modified case record form for severe acute respiratory infection clinical characterisation shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) from electronic medical records. Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected. To ascertain the epidemiological and symptom data, which were not available from electronic medical records, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. To characterise the effect of coronavirus on the production of cytokines or chemokines in the acute phase of the illness, plasma cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8 (also known as CXCL8), IL9, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL15, IL17A, Eotaxin (also known as CCL11), basic FGF2, GCSF (CSF3), GMCSF (CSF2), IFNγ, IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3), MIP1B (CCL4), PDGFB, RANTES (CCL5), TNFα, and VEGFA were measured using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma samples from four healthy adults were used as controls for crosscomparison. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days (IQR 2-5). Each 80 µL plasma sample from the patients and contacts was added into 240 µL of Trizol LS (10296028; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 µL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 µL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was per formed using the following conditions: 50°C for 15 min and 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO For the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium-WHO case record form for severe acute respiratory infections see https://isaric.tghn.org/protocols/ severe-acute-respiratory- infection-data-tools/ 0 <18 18-24 25-49 50-64 ≥65 5 10 15 20 Number of cases Age (years) A General ward Intensive care unit D e c 1 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 0 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 1 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 2 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 3 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 4 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 5 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 6 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 7 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 8 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 1 9 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 0 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 1 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 2 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 3 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 4 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 5 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 6 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 7 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 8 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 2 9 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 3 0 , 2 0 1 9 D e c 3 1 , 2 0 1 9 J a n 1 , 2 0 2 0 J a n 2 , 2 0 2 0 0 2 4 6 8 Number of cases Onset date B No Yes Huanan seafood market exposure Epidemiological alert Market closed for novel coronavirus. 9 Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO₂) of less than 300 mm Hg. (Sanz et al., 2011) Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification. (Anon, 2012) Secondary infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteraemia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new pathogen from a lower respiratory tract specimen (including the sputum, transtracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or from blood samples taken ≥48 h after admission). (Garner et al., 1988) Cardiac injury followed the definition used in our previous study in H7N9 patients. (Gao et al., 2020) In brief, cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography. Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by χ² test or Fisher's exact test between ICU care and no ICU care groups. Boxplots were drawn to describe plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations. A two-sided α of less than 0•05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software, version 9.4, unless otherwise indicated. The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan. 20 [49%]) of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients were aged 25-49 years, and 14 (34%) were aged 50-64 years (figure 1A). The median age of the patients was 49•0 years (IQR 41•0-58•0; table 1). In our cohort of the first 41 patients as of Jan 2, no children or adolescents were infected. Of the 41 patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to the ICU because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to cor rect hypoxaemia. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%]); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). 27 (66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market (figure 1B). Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms All patients (n=41) ICU care (n=13) No ICU care (n=28) p value Characteristics Age, years 49•0 (41•0-58•0) 49•0 (41•0-61•0) 49•0 (41•0-57•5) 0•60 Sex •• •• •• 0•24 Men 30 (73%) 11 (85%) 19 (68%) •• Women 11 (27%) 2 (15%) 9 (32%) •• Huanan seafood market exposure 27 (66%) 9 (69%) 18 (64%) 0•75 Current smoking 3 (7%) 0 3 (11%) 0•31 Any comorbidity 13 (32%) 5 (38%) 8 (29%) 0•53 Diabetes 8 (20%) 1 (8%) 7 (25%) 0•16 Hypertension 6 (15%) 2 (15%) 4 (14%) 0•93 Cardiovascular disease 6 (15%) 3 (23%) 3 (11%) 0•32 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 1 (2%) 1 (8%) 0 0•14 Malignancy 1 (2%) 0 1 (4%) 0•49 Chronic liver disease 1 (2%) 0 1 (4%) 0•68 Signs and symptoms Fever 40 (98%) 13 (100%) 27 (96%) 0•68 Highest temperature, °C • 23%) 11 (39%) •• Cough 31 (76%) 11 (85%) 20 (71%) 0•35 Myalgia or fatigue 18 (44%) 7 (54%) 11 (39%) 0•38 Sputum production 11/39 (28%) 5 (38%) 6/26 (23%) 0•32 Headache 3/38 (8%) 0 3/25 (12%) 0•10 Haemoptysis 2/39 (5%) 1 (8%) 1/26 (4%) 0•46 Diarrhoea 1/38 (3%) 0 1/25 (4%) 0•66 Dyspnoea 22/40 (55%) 12 (92%) 10/27 (37%) 0•0010 Days from illness onset to dyspnoea 8•0 (5•0-13•0) 8•0 (6•0-17•0) 6•5 (2•0-10•0) 0•22 Days from first admission to transfer 5•0 (1•0-8•0) 8•0 (5•0-14•0) 1•0 (1•0-6•5) 0•0023 Systolic pressure, mm Hg 125•0 (119•0-135•0) 145•0 (123•0-167•0) 122•0 (118•5-129•5) 0•018 Respiratory rate >24 breaths per min 12 (29%) 8 (62%) 4 (14%) 0•0023 Data are median (IQR), n (%), or n/N (%), where N is the total number of patients with available data. p values comparing ICU care and no ICU care are from χ² test, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test. 2019-nCoV=2019 novel coronavirus. ICU=intensive care unit. Table 1: Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients infected with 2019-nCoV were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38; table 1). More than half of patients (22 [55%] of 40) developed dyspnoea. The median duration from illness onset to dyspnoea was 8•0 days (IQR 5•0-13•0). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7•0 days (4•0-8•0), to shortness of breath was 8•0 days (5•0-13•0), to ARDS was 9•0 days (8•0-14•0), to mechanical venti lation was 10•5 days (7•0-14•0), and to ICU admission was 10•5 days (8•0-17•0; figure 2). The blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 4 × 10⁹/L; ten [25%] of 40 patients) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1•0 × 10⁹/L; 26 [63%] patients; table 2). Prothrombin time and D-dimer level on admission were higher in ICU patients (median prothrombin time 12•2 s [IQR 11•2-13•4]; median D-dimer level 2•4 mg/L [0•6-14•4]) than non-ICU patients (median prothrombin time 10•7 s ). Levels of aspartate amino transferase were increased in 15 (37%) of 41 patients, including eight (62%) of 13 ICU patients and seven (25%) of 28 non-ICU patients. Hypersensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) was increased substantially in five patients, in whom the diagnosis of virus-related cardiac injury was made. Most patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission (procalcitonin <0•1 ng/mL; 27 [69%] patients; table 2). Four ICU patients developed secondary infections. Three of the four patients with secondary infection had procalcitonin greater than 0•5 ng/mL (0•69 ng/mL, 1•46 ng/mL, and 6•48 ng/mL). On admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Of the 41 patients, 40 (98%) had bilateral involvement (table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images of ICU patients on admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3A). The representative chest CT findings of non-ICU patients showed bilateral groundglass opacity and subseg mental areas of consolidation (figure 3B). Later chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, whereas the consolidation had been resolved (figure 3C). Initial plasma IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNFα, and VEGF concentrations were higher in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients than in healthy adults (appendix pp 6-7). Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between healthy adults and patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Further comparison between ICU and non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients. All patients had pneumonia. Common compli cations included ARDS (12 [29%] of 41 patients), followed by RNAaemia (six [15%] patients), acute cardiac injury (five [12%] patients), and secondary infection (four [10%] patients; table 3). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in four (10%) patients, with two of them (5%) had refractory hypoxaemia and received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as salvage therapy. All patients were administered with empirical antibiotic treatment, and 38 (93%) patients received antiviral therapy (osel tamivir). Additionally, nine (22%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. A comparison of clinical features between patients who received and did not receive systematic corticosteroids is in the appendix (pp 1-5). As of Jan 22, 2020, 28 (68%) of 41 patients have been dis charged and six (15%) patients have died. Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least 10 days, with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract. We report here a cohort of 41 patients with laboratoryconfirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan, China, by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. The time between hospital admission and ARDS was as short as 2 days. At this stage, the mortality rate is high for 2019-nCoV, because six (15%) of 41 patients in this cohort died. The number of deaths is rising quickly. As of Jan 24, 2020, 835 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infec tions were reported in China, with 25 fatal cases. Reports have been released of exported cases in many provinces in China, and in other countries; Onset Admission Dyspnoea Acute respiratory distress syndrome Intensive care unit admission 7 8 9 10•5 Median time Number of cases Days 41 (100%) 41 (100%) 21 (51%) 11 (27%) 16 (39%) See Online for appendix some health-care workers have also been infected in Wuhan. Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human trans mission. (Perlman & Netland, 2009) Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely moni tored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers All patients (n=41) ICU care (n=13) No ICU care (n=28) p value White blood cell count, × 10⁹ per L 6•2 (4•1-10•5) 11•3 (5•8-12•1) 5•7 (3•1-7•6) 0•011 <4 10/40 (25%) 1/13 (8%) 9/27 (33%) 0•041 4-10 18/40 (45%) 5/13 (38%) 13/27 (48%) •• before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymp tomatic infections. Similarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans. These features of 2019-nCoV infection bear some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. (Lee et al., 2003)(Assiri et al., 2013) However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. Furthermore, 2019-nCoV patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhoea), whereas about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhoea. (Assiri et al., 2013) Faecal and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage. The pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients. (Wong et al., 2004) MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL15, and IL17). (Mahallawi et al., 2018) We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection. (Wong et al., 2004) Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2 responses in 2019-nCoV infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease. In view of the high amount of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV, (Wong et al., 2004)(He et al., 2006) MERS-CoV, (Faure et al., 2014)(Falzarano et al., 2013) and 2019-nCoV infections, corticosteroids were used frequently for treatment of patients with severe illness, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury. However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS A B C suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance. (Stockman et al., 2006)(Lansbury et al., 2019)(Arabi et al., 2018) Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance. (Anon, 2020) Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV. No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. In a historical control study, (Chu, 2004) the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia. (Arabi et al., 2018) Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. (Sheahan et al., 2017)(Sheahan et al., 2020) As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection. Our study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariableadjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively. (Cui et al., 2019) Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats. In 2013, Ge and colleagues (Ge et al., 2013) reported the whole genome sequence of a SARS-like coronavirus in bats with that ability to use human ACE2 as a receptor, thus having replication potentials in human cells. (Wang & Hu, 2013) 2019-nCoV still needs to be studied deeply in case it becomes a global health threat. Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients. Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.

    "abstract": "Background A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. Findings By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49•0 years (IQR 41•0-58•0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8•0 days [IQR 5•0-13•0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. Interpretation The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.",

    "fulltext": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronavirdiae, order Nidovirales. There are four genera of CoVs, namely, Alphacoronavirus (αCoV), Betacoronavirus (βCoV), Deltacoronavirus (δCoV), and Gammacoronavirus (γCoV) (Chan et al., 2013). Evolutionary analyses have shown that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most αCoVs and βCoVs, while avian species are the gene sources of most δCoVs and γCoVs. CoVs have repeatedly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens. The best-known examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) which emerged in China in (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) to cause a large-scale epidemic with about 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) which has caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 (Cheng et al., 2007)(Chan et al., 2015). In both of these epidemics, these viruses have likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host [the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) for MERS-CoV] before crossing species barriers to infect humans. Prior to December 2019, 6 CoVs were known to infect human, including 2 αCoV (HCoV-229E and HKU-NL63) and 4 βCoV (HCoV-OC43 [lineage A], HCoV-HKU1 [lineage A], SARS-CoV [lineage B] and MERS-CoV [lineage C]). The βCoV lineage A HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and elderly (Woo et al., 2005). In contrast, SARS-CoV (lineage B βCoV) and MERS-CoV (lineage C βCoV) may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as diarrhea, lymphopenia, deranged liver and renal function tests, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of ∼10% and ∼35%, respectively (Peiris et al., 2003)(Yeung et al., 2016). On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China (Anon, n.d.). Subsequent virological testing showed that a novel CoV was detected in these patients. As of 16 January 2020, 43 patients have been diagnosed to have infection with this novel CoV, including two exported cases of mild pneumonia in Thailand and Japan (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2020). The earliest date of symptom onset was 1 December 2019 (Huang et al., 2020). The symptomatology of these patients included fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea. Among 41 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan, 13 (32%) required intensive care and 6 (15%) died. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computerized tomography scans (Huang et al., 2020). We recently reported a familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection in a Shenzhen family with travel history to Wuhan (Chan et al., 2020). In the present study, we analyzed a 2019-nCoV complete genome from a patient in this familial cluster and compared it with the genomes of related βCoVs to provide insights into the potential source and control strategies. The complete genome sequence of 2019-nCoV HKU-SZ-005b was available at GenBank (accession no. MN975262) (Table 1). The representative complete genomes of other related βCoVs strains collected from human or mammals were included for comparative analysis. These included strains collected from human, bats, and Himalayan palm civet between 2003 and 2018, with one 229E coronavirus strain as the outgroup. Phylogenetic tree construction by the neighbour joining method was performed using MEGA X software, with bootstrap values being calculated from 1000 trees (Saitou & Nei, 1987). The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) was shown next to the branches (Felsenstein, 1985). The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and were in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site (Anon, 1965). All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018). Multiple alignment was performed using CLUSTAL 2.1 and further visualized using BOX-SHADE 3.21. Structural analysis of orf8 was performed using PSI-blast-based secondary structure PREDiction (PSIPRED) (Buchan & Jones, 2019). For the prediction of protein secondary structure including beta sheet, alpha helix, and coil, initial amino acid sequences were input and analysed using neural networking and its own algorithm. Predicted structures were visualized and highlighted on the BOX-SHADE alignment. Prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using the TMHMM 2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Secondary structure prediction in the 5 ′ -untranslated region (UTR) and 3 ′ -UTR was performed using the RNAfold WebServer (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/ RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) with minimum free energy (MFE) and partition function in Fold algorithms and basic options. The human SARS-CoV 5 ′ -and 3 ′ -UTR were used as references to adjust the prediction results. The single-stranded RNA genome of the 2019-nCoV was 29891 nucleotides in size, encoding 9860 amino acids. The G + C content was 38%. Similar to other βCoVs, the 2019-nCoV genome contains two flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) and a single long open reading frame encoding a polyprotein. The 2019-nCoV genome is arranged in the order of 5 ′ -replicase (orf1/ab)-structural proteins [Spike (S)-Envelope (E)-Membrane (M)-Nucleocapsid (N)]-3 ′ and lacks the hemagglutinin-esterase gene which is characteristically found in lineage A β-CoVs (Figure 1). There are 12 putative, functional open reading frames (orfs) expressed from a nested set of 9 subgenomic mRNAs carrying a conserved leader sequence in the genome, 9 transcription-regulatory sequences, and 2 terminal untranslated regions. The 5 ′ -and 3 ′ -UTRs are 265 and 358 nucleotides long, respectively. The 5 ′ -and 3 ′ -UTR sequences of 2019-nCoV are similar to those of other βCoVs with nucleotide identities of ⩾83.6%. The large replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab encoded by the partially overlapping 5 ′ -terminal orf1a/b within the 5 ′ two-thirds of the genome is proteolytic cleaved into 16 putative non-structural proteins (nsps). These putative nsps included two viral cysteine proteases, namely, nsp3 (papain-like protease) and nsp5 (chymotrypsin-like, 3C-like, or main protease), nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]), nsp13 (helicase), and other nsps which are likely involved in the transcription and replication of the virus (Table 2). There are no remarkable differences between the orfs and nsps of 2019-nCoV with those of SARS-CoV (Table 3). The major distinction between SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV is in orf3b, Spike and orf8 but especially variable in Spike S1 and orf8 which were previously shown to be recombination hot spots. Spike glycoprotein comprised of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by , respectively) and human SARS coronavirus (accession number AY274119) was performed using the neighbour-joining method with bootstrap 1000. The evolutionary distances were calculated using the JTT matrix-based method. (B) Multiple alignment was performed and displayed using CLUSTAL 2.1 and BOXSHADE 3.21, respectively. The black background represents the identity while the grey background represents the similarity of the amino acid sequences. (C) Structural analysis of Orf8 was performed using PSI-blast-based secondary structure PREDiction (PSIPRED). Predicted helix structure (h) and strand (s) were boxed with red and yellow respectively. an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP). We found that the S2 subunit of 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV (Figure 2). Thus the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 would be an important preventive and treatment modality for testing in animal models before clinical trials (Xia et al., 2019). Though the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV (Figure 3(A)), the core domain of RBD (excluding the external subdomain) are highly conserved (Figure 3(B)). Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction with the host receptor. Further investigation of this soluble variable external subdomain region will reveal its receptor usage, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis. Unlike 2019-nCoV and human SARS-CoV, most known bat SARSr-CoVs have two stretches of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) when compared with that of human SARS-CoV. But some Yunnan strains such as the WIV1 had no such deletions and can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor. It is interesting to note that the two bat SARS-related coronavirus ZXC21 and ZC45, being closest to 2019-nCoV, can infect suckling rats and cause inflammation in the brain tissue, and pathological changes in lung & intestine. However, these two viruses could not be isolated in Vero E6 cells and were not investigated further. The two retained deletion sites in the Spike genes of ZXC21 and ZC45 may lessen their likelihood of jumping species barriers imposed by receptor specificity. A novel short putative protein with 4 helices and no homology to existing SARS-CoV or SARS-r-CoV protein was found within Orf3b (Figure 4). It is notable that SARS-CoV deletion mutants lacking orf3b replicate to levels similar to those of wildtype virus in several cell types (Yount et al., 2005), suggesting that orf3b is dispensable for viral replication in vitro. But orf3b may have a role in viral pathogenicity as Vero E6 but not 293T cells transfected with a construct expressing Orf3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time points (Khan et al., 2006). Orf3b was also shown to inhibit expression of IFN-β at synthesis and signalling (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007). Subsequently, orf3b homologues identified from three bat SARSrelated-CoV strains were C-terminally truncated and lacked the C-terminal nucleus localization signal of SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2012). IFN antagonist activity analysis demonstrated that one SARS-related-CoV orf3b still possessed IFN antagonist and IRF3-modulating activities. These results indicated that different orf3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SARS-related-CoV orf3b function and pathogenesis. The importance of this new protein in 2019-nCoV will require further validation and study. orf8 is an accessory protein found in the Betacoronavirus lineage B coronaviruses. Human SARS-CoVs isolated from early-phase patients, all civet SARS-CoVs, and other bat SARS-related CoVs contain fulllength orf8 (Song et al., 2005). However, a 29-nucleotide deletion, Bat SL-CoV ZXC21 2018 which causes the split of full length of orf8 into putative orf8a and orf8b, has been found in all SARS-CoV isolated from mid-and late-phase human patients (Oostra et al., 2007). In addition, we have previously identified two bat SARS-related-CoV (Bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C) and proposed that the original SARS-CoV full-length orf8 is acquired from these two bat SARS-related-CoV (Lau et al., 2015). Since the SARS-CoV is the closest human pathogenic virus to the 2019-nCoV, we performed phylogenetic analysis and multiple alignments to investigate the orf8 amino acid sequences. The orf8 protein sequences used in the analysis derived from early phase SARS-CoV that includes full-length orf8 (human SARS-CoV GZ02), the mid-and late-phase SARS-CoV that includes the split orf8b (human SARS-CoV Tor2), civet SARS-CoV (paguma SARS-CoV), two bat SARS-related-CoV containing full-length orf8 (bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C), 2019-nCoV, the other two closest bat SARS-related-CoV to 2019-nCoV SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45), and bat SARS-related-CoV HKU3-1 (Figure 5(A)). As expected, orf8 derived from 2019-nCoV belongs to the group that includes the closest genome sequences of bat SARS-related-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45. Interestingly, the new 2019-nCoV orf8 is distant from the conserved orf8 or Human SARS-CoV BJ01 2003 SARS coronavirus HKU-39849 2003 Human SARS-CoV Tor2 2003 Human SARS-CoV GZ02 2003 Bat CoV YN2018C 2018 Bat SL-CoV Rs4231 2016 Paguma SARS CoV HC/SZ/61/03 2003 Bat SL-CoV Rs672 2006 Bat SL-CoV Rs4255 2016 Bat SL-CoV RsSHC014 2013 Bat SL-CoV Rs3367 2013 Bat CoV YN2018D 2018 Bat SARS-related CoV BM48-31 2009 HKU-SZ-005b Bat SL-CoV ZC45 2018 Bat SL-CoV ZXC21 2018 Bat CoV HKU9-1 2006 Bat CoV HKU4-1 2006 Bat CoV HKU5-1 2006 Human MERS-CoV 2012 Human CoV OC43 2003 Human CoV HKU1 2004 Human CoV 229E 2000 100 100 88 72 95 99 100 77 89 90 0.20 orf8b derived from human SARS-CoV or its related viruses derived from civet (paguma SARS-CoV) and bat . This new orf8 of 2019-nCoV does not contain known functional domain or motif. An aggregation motif VLVVL (amino acid 75-79) has been found in SARS-CoV orf8b (Figure 5(B)) which was shown to trigger intracellular stress pathways and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes (Shi et al., 2019), but this is absent in this novel orf8 of 2019-nCoV. Based on a secondary structure prediction, this novel orf8 has a high possibility to form a protein with an alpha-helix, following with a betasheet(s) containing six strands (Figure 5(C)). The genome of 2019-nCoV has overall 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-related-CoV SL-CoVZXC21 (MG772934.1), and 82% with human SARS-CoV BJ01 2003 (AY278488) and human SARS-CoV Tor2 (AY274119). The phylogenetic trees constructed using the amino acid sequences of orf1a/b and the 4 structural genes (S, E, M, and N) were shown (Figure 6(A-E)). For all these 5 genes, the 2019-nCoV was clustered with lineage B βCoVs. bats (Rhinolopus sinicus) collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China between 2015 and 2017. Thus this novel coronavirus should belong to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sabecovirus (previously lineage 2b of Group 2 coronavirus). SARS-related coronaviruses have been found continuously especially in horseshoe bat species in the last 13 years. Between 2003 and 2018, 339 complete SARS-related coronavirus genomes have been sequenced, including 274 human SARS-CoV, 18 civet SARS coronavirus, and 47 bat SARS-related coronaviruses mainly from Rhinolophus bat species. Together, they formed a distinct subclade among other lineage B βCoVs. These results suggested that the 2019-nCoV might have also originated from bats. But we cannot ascertain whether another intermediate or amplification animal host infected by 2019-nCoV could be found in the epidemiological market, just as in the case of Paguma civets for SARS-CoV. As shown in Figure 7(A-C), the SARS-CoV 5 ′ -UTR contains SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, S5, SL5A, SL5B, SL5C, SL6, SL7, and SL8. The SL3 contains trans-cis motif (Yang & Leibowitz, 2015). The SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, S5, SL5A, SL5B, and SL5C structures were similar among the 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV and the bat SARS-related ZC45. In the 2019-nCoV, part of the S5 found was inside the orf1a/b (marked in red), which was similar to SARS-CoV. In bat SARS-related CoV ZC45, the S5 was not found inside orf1a/b. The 2019-nCoV had the same SL6, SL7, and SL8 as SARS-CoV, and an additional stem loop. Bat SARS-related CoV ZC45 did not have the SARS-COV SL6-like stem loop. Instead, it possessed two other stem loops in this region. All three strains had similar SL7 and SL8. The bat SARS-like CoV ZC45 also had an additional stem loop between SL7 and SL8. Overall, the 5 ′ -UTR of 2019-nCoV was more similar to that of SARS-CoV than the bat SARS-related CoV ZC 45. The biological relevance and effects of virulence of the 5 ′ -UTR structures should be investigated further. The 2019-nCoV had various 3 ′ -UTR structures, including BSL, S1, S2, S3, S4, L1, L2, L3, and HVR (Figure 7(D-F)). The 3 ′ -UTR was conserved among 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs (Yang & Leibowitz, 2015). In summary, 2019-nCoV is a novel lineage B Betacoronavirus closely related to bat SARS-related coronaviruses. It also has unique genomic features which deserves further investigation to ascertain their roles in viral replication cycle and pathogenesis. More animal sampling to determine its natural animal reservoir and intermediate animal host in the market is important. This will shed light on the evolutionary history of this emerging coronavirus which has jumped into human after the other two zoonotic Betacoroanviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

    "abstract": "A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.",

    "title": "Incubation Period and Other Epidemiological Characteristics of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infections with Right Truncation: A Statistical Analysis of Publicly Available Case Data",
    "full_text": "As of 31 January 2020, mainland China reported 11,791 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (COVID- (Fraser et al., 2009) infections, causing 259 deaths (Anon, 2020). Initially, these infections were thought to result from zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission; however, recently published evidence (Anon, n.d.) and the exponential growth of case incidences show compelling evidence of human-to-human secondary transmission fueled by travel, with many cases detected in other parts of the world (Anon, 2020). This geographic expansion beyond the initial epicenter of Wuhan provides an opportunity to study the natural history of COVID-19 infection, as these migration events limit the risk of infection to the time during which an individual traveled to an area where exposure could occur (Nishiura et al., 2007). The incubation period is defined as the time from infection to illness onset. Knowledge of the incubation period of a directly transmitted infectious disease is critical to determine the time period required for monitoring and restricting the movement of healthy individuals (i.e., the quarantine period) (Lessler et al., 2009)(Nishiura, 2009). The incubation period also aids in understanding the relative infectiousness of COVID-19 and can be used to estimate the epidemic size (Nishiura et al., 2020). Time-delay distributions including the dates of hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) and death also inform the temporal dynamics of epidemics. A published clinical study on the COVID-19 epidemic has already shown that the average time delay from illness onset to hospital admission is approximately 7 days (Huang et al., 2020), but this distribution has yet to be explicitly estimated. The time from hospital admission to death is also critical to the avoidance of underestimation when calculating case fatality risk (Anon, n.d.). Using publicly available data from the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 with known event dates, the present study aimed to estimate the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the interpretation of epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. We retrieved information on cases with confirmed COVID-19 infection and diagnosis outside of the epicenter of Wuhan, China, based on official reports from governmental institutes, as well as reports on deceased cases from both in and outside of Wuhan. We aggregated the data directly from government websites or from news sites that quoted government statements. The data were collected in real time, and thus may have been updated as more details on cases became available. The arranged data include a selection of cases reported through 31 January 2020 and are available as Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Specifically, we collected the dates of exposure (entry and/or exit from Wuhan or dates of close contact with a Wuhan resident/known epidemic case), illness onset, earliest healthcare seeking related to infection, hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation), and death. Cases included both residents from other locations who travelled to Wuhan, as well as individuals who lived, worked, or studied in Wuhan (hereafter: Wuhan residents) but who were diagnosed outside of Wuhan and reported by the governments of the locations where their infection was detected. We thus estimated the incubation period by (i) excluding Wuhan residents and (ii) including Wuhan residents. The former may be more precise in defining the interval of exposure, but the sample size is greater for the latter. More detailed information about the criteria used for the estimation of each defined time interval and data used are described in Supplementary Text S1. We used the dates of three critical points in the course of infection-symptom onset, hospital admission, and death-to calculate four time intervals: the time from (a) exposure to illness onset (i.e., incubation period), (b) illness onset to hospital admission, (c) illness onset to death, and (d) hospital admission to death. We used a doubly interval-censored (Reich et al., 2009) likelihood function to estimate the parameter values for these intervals, written as: ( Here, in the case of (a) g(.) is the probability density function (PDF) of exposure following a uniform distribution, and f (.) is the PDF of the incubation period independent of g(.). D represents a dataset among all observed cases i, where exposure and symptom onset fall within the lower and upper bounds (E L , E R ) and (S L , S R ). We fit the PDF f (.) to lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions. To address the selection bias in the dataset due to the continued growth of the outbreak (i.e., cases with shorter incubation periods are more likely to be included in the dataset), we also accounted for right truncation using the formula: Here, r is the exponential growth rate (estimated at 0.14 (Jung et al., n.d.)), and T is the latest time of observation (31 January 2020), and F (.) is the cumulative density function of f (.). In both cases, we used Bayesian methods to infer parameter estimates and obtain credible intervals. We selected the best fit model by using the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC). We also verified that the Bayesian estimates were in line with pointwise estimates derived by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). As the formulation of the likelihood with right truncation (1)-( 2) contained the function f ′ and was dependent on both the time interval (s -e) and time of exposure e, we generalized a previously obtained result for doubly interval-censored likelihood with f ′ (s -e, e) ≡ f (s -e) (Reich et al., 2009). The data were processed using R version 3.6.2 (Anon, 2020), MLE was computed using Julia version 1.3 (Anon, 2017), and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations were performed in Stan (cmdStan version 2.22.1 (Anon, 2020)). All code is freely available at the github repository (Anon, n.d.). The ratio of male to female cases among living cases resembled (Anon, n.d.), at 58%, with most 30-59 years of age (information missing for 9 cases). The deceased cases were more predominantly male (70%) and older (85% were 60 years of age or older). Table 1 shows estimates for the various time intervals without right truncation. For the incubation period estimates, the lognormal distribution provided the best fit to the data, both when excluding and including Wuhan residents. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.0 days (95% credible interval [CI]: 4.2, 6.0) when excluding Wuhan residents (n = 52) and 5.6 days (95% CI: 5.0, 6.3) when including Wuhan residents (n = 158). The median time from illness onset to hospital admission was estimated at 3.3 days (95% CI: 2.7, 4.0) among living cases and 6.5 days (95% CI: 5.2, 8.0) among deceased cases using the gamma distribution, Table 2. Right-truncated incubation period and other time-delay distributions for COVID-19 outbreak cases reported in January 2020 applied to the lognormal distribution. WR: Wuhan residents. SD: standard deviation. which provided the best fit for both sets of data. Figure 1A shows the corresponding PDFs. Data from the time from illness onset and hospital admission to death best fit lognormal and Weibull distributions, respectively, as presented in Figure 1B,C. The mean time from illness onset to death was 15.0 days (95% CI: 12.8, 17.5) and from hospital admission to death was 8.8 days (95% CI: 7.2, 10.8). Table 2 shows estimates for the fit of the lognormal distribution for each interval when accounting for right truncation. The mean incubation period was 5.6 days (95% CI: 4.4, 7.4) when excluding Wuhan residents-slightly larger than the estimate without right truncation. The mean estimate for illness onset to hospital admission was 9.7 days (95% CI: 5.4, 17.0) for living cases and 6.6 days (95% CI: 5.2, 8.8) for deceased cases, with the former nearly 2.5 times the length of its untruncated version. Illness onset to death and hospital admission to death were likewise longer than their non-truncated counterparts, at 20.2 days (95% CI: 15.1, 29.5) and 13.0 days (95% CI: 8.7, 20.9), respectively. Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function of the incubation period with and without right truncation. The 5th and 95th percentiles are shown in addition to the median. The 95th percentiles were estimated at 10.6 days (95% CI: 8.5, 14.1) and 10.8 days (95% CI: 9.3, 12.9) for non-truncated data excluding and including Wuhan residents and 12.3 days (95% CI: 9.1, 19.8) when applying right truncation and excluding Wuhan residents. The respective median values for these CDFs were 4.3 days (95% CI: 3.5, 5.1), 5.0 days (95% CI: 4.4, 5.6), and 4.6 days (95% CI: 3.7, 5.7). The present study advances the public discussion on COVID-19 infections by presenting explicit estimations of the incubation period and other epidemiologic characteristics using publicly available data. Our estimated mean incubation period of approximately 5 days is comparable to known mean values of the incubation period for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [9, (Lessler et al., 2009)(Virlogeux et al., 2016)(Backer et al., 2020), as well as other recent estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 (Backer et al., 2020). In addition to empirically showing the comparability of COVID-19 to other disease-causing coronaviruses, the present study has also shown that the 95th percentile of the incubation period is around 10-14 days, indicating that a 14-day quarantine period would largely ensure the absence of disease among healthy exposed individuals. Wuhan residents have a less precisely defined exposure period compared to travelers and secondary cases from known human to human transmission events. However, our calculations have shown that adding more cases to the dataset even with uncertainty reduces both the variance of the estimates and selection bias, improving the fit of the distribution mean. Our estimates are in agreement with the report of Li et al. (Anon, n.d.). A recent study by Backer et al. (Backer et al., 2020) noted a similar finding in their analysis of the incubation period for 88 cases (including 63 Wuhan residents). However, the estimates of Backer et al. for the model that included Wuhan residents were subject to overestimation as the lower bounds for Wuhan residents-who had unknown left exposure dates-were fixed in their analysis. In contrast, we considered the left exposure dates for Wuhan residents as parameters to be fitted-see (Anon, 2020) for details. Notably, our results demonstrated the overall benefit of using additional case data, even when some of exposure values were not precisely known. The time from the illness onset to death is also comparable to SARS (Lessler et al., 2009), and the 15-20-day mean delay indicates that a crude estimation of the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to that of confirmed cases will tend to result in an underestimation of the case fatality risk, especially during the early stage of epidemic spread. During the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, 2003, the time from illness onset to hospital admission was shown to have shortened as a function of the calendar time, gradually reflecting the effects of contact tracing (Anon, n.d.). It remains to be seen if this will be the case for COVID-19 as well. The time delay distribution between illness onset and hospital admission may also be negatively associated with the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population (Fraser et al., 2009). The median time from illness onset to hospital admission was approximately 4 days among cases not known to be deceased at the time of the case report, and 6 days among cases reported as deceased. The reasons for this difference are not altogether clear. However, the living cases include persons who were isolated-in some cases more for reducing transmission than for treatment purposes-while all deceased cases were admitted for treatment. In addition, deceased cases for whom information was available had onset dates closer to the beginning of the outbreak compared to the living cases, who mostly had onset in the latter two-thirds of January 2020. The time delay distributions from illness onset to hospital admission for cases reported later in the epidemic, when there was a more widespread recognition of the virus and a more prevalent social imperative for those with symptoms to seek healthcare, may differ from those of early cases (Anon, n.d.). Several limitations of the present study exist. First, the dataset relies on publicly available information that is not uniformly distributed (i.e., collected from various sources), and therefore the availability of dates relevant to our analyses is limited to a small, selective sample that is not necessarily generalizable to all confirmed cases. Moreover, given the novelty of the COVID-19 pneumonia, it is possible that illness onset and other event data were handled differently between jurisdictions (e.g., was illness onset the date of fever or date of dyspnea?). Second, our data include very coarse date intervals with some proxy dates used to determine the left and/or right hand dates of some intervals. Third, as the sample size was limited, the variance is likely to be biased. Fourth, we were not able to examine the heterogeneity of estimates by different attributes of cases (e.g., severity of disease) (Fraser et al., 2009). Lastly, as we only have information on confirmed cases, there is a bias towards more severe disease-particularly for earlier cases. This study presents the estimates of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 infections that are key parameter for studies on incidence, case fatality, and epidemic final size, among other possibilities (Nishiura et al., 2020)(Jung et al., n.d.). From the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period we found that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days, and we stress that the 17-24-day time delay from illness onset to death must be addressed when estimating COVID-19 case fatality risk. This study was made possible only through open sharing of case data from China and other countries where cases were diagnosed. Continued communication of dates and other details related to exposure and infection is crucial to furthering scientific understanding of the virus, the infections it causes, and preventive measures that can be used to contain and mitigate epidemic spread.

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.",
