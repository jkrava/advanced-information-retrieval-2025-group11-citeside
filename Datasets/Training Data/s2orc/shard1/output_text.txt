    "text": "\nIn the last few years, several techniques have been extensively used to study the conductance of nanometerscale contacts with variable cross sections [1][2][3][4]. Most of the previous works have been focused on metallic contacts, for which the Fermi wavelength λ F is very close to the dimensions of the atom. The elongation of the contact produces discrete changes in the cross section (i.e. in the number of atoms) resulting in abrupt jumps in the experimental G − Z curves (conductance vs. elongation of the contact). These jumps are of the order of the conductance quantum G 0 = 2e 2 /h since the addition of one atom to the contact is accompanied by the opening of one or few conduction channels depending on the metal [5]. This interplay between electronic and mechanical properties in metallic contacts [6,7] makes it difficult to observe \"pure\" quantum effects on the conductance. \n\nOn the other hand, semimetallic nanocontacts could provide a unique laboratory to investigate quantum conductance phenomena in three-dimensional wires. The high value of λ F in these systems requires large contact areas in order to have total transmissions of the order of a conductance quantum. As a consequence, it will be possible to distinguish between atomic rearrangements and quantum effects. However, earlier experimental results did not clarify the situation. The first experiments [8] on semimetallic Sb contacts showed several sharp jumps in the G − Z curves for conductances much lower than the quantum unit, proving that, indeed, many atoms are necessary in order to obtain a value of the conductance equal to G 0 . Nevertheless the conductance quantization features were absent probably due to a strong backscattering [8] or to the large angular opening [9] of the contact. More recently, conductance experiments [10] on Bi nanowires at 4K presented a very different behaviour showing, in some situations, long conductance plateaus close to integer multiples of G 0 . After statistical averaging of many consecutive curves, the histogram of conductance values showed the existence of two peaks close to G 0 and 2G 0 . However, the shape of the histogram exhibited strong deviations from those reported in metallic contacts. In order to shine some light on the physics of semimetallic contacts, we have performed scanning tun-neling microscopy (STM) experiments on Bi nanocontacts at different temperatures. First, we analyze in detail the opening of the first conduction channel, which is a particularly difficult task in metallic contacts, where the transition from the tunneling regime into contact is governed by the well known jump-to-contact phenomenon [11]. The peculiar electronic structure of bismuth [12,13] enables a selection of the carrier type, depending on the dimensions of the contact and temperature [14]. This effect will be studied at 77K and 4.2K for contacts with typical conductances in the range 0 < G < 2G 0 . The coexistence of conductance quantization effects and atomic rearrangements will be studied through conductance histograms of the G − Z curves. Due to the fact that even for low conductance values many atoms will be forming the contact, the evolution of the G − Z curves will be analyzed in terms of a simple gliding mechanism that describes the variation of the contact shape during the elongation process. \n\nThe experiments have been performed using a high stability scanning tunneling microscope (STM) which can be operated over the range 2 K -300 K inside a 4 He cryostat. We have used high-purity (99.999%) polycrystalline bismuth, cut from a rod, for both STM tip and sample. Prior to the measurements the surfaces were cut and scratched. At a given location on the sample, the tip is crashed forcibly and repeatedly into the substrate, causing extended plastic deformations that lead to a connective neck between tip and sample. Different neck geometries can be obtained by varying the indentation depth [7]. In Fig. 1 (Fig. 2 ) we show typical G − Z curves corresponding to a series of consecutive elongation cycles measured at 77K ( 4K ). Continuous cycles of elongation-contraction of a neck lead to situations in which the G − Z curve presents clear steps over the entire conductance range (typically from 0 to 10 G 0 ). Although the curves are not reproducible they show a very similar shape. Typically, the length of the steps varies between 0.2 and 1 nm, depending on the initial conditions of the elongation-contraction cycle (i.e., the neck) [15]. These values are close to the lattice parameter of Bi (0.475nm). At 77 K the conductance steps have a small positive slope without specific structure. However, at 4K the first plateaus with G > ∼ G 0 usually show smooth curved shapes which resemble those observed for metallic Al contacts [16,17]. Moreover, the conductance discontinuities ∆G are closer to G 0 , suggesting that at 4K bismuth exhibits a metallic-like behaviour, with a smaller λ F . Therefore, only a few atoms are involved in the contact. Distortions of the lattice parameter at the contact, together with the peculiar band structure of bismuth, are responsible of the curved plateaus obtained at 4 K. As expected for a semimetallic contact, in the subquantum conductance regime the G − Z curves show clear steps at both temperatures (see Figs. 1 and 2). Except for the small jump discontinuities (caused by rearrangements of the atoms and thus reflecting mechanical contact), G decreases exponentially as a function of Z like in a vacuum tunneling process, but with an effective tunneling barrier that strongly depends on temperature (see Figs. 1b and 2b). While at 77K the effective barriers are typically of the order of 10meV, those obtained at 4K are close to 1eV. When the contact finally breaks, the conductance is usually so small that, due to limitations of our current experimental setup, we are not able to observe the transition from \"contact\" tunneling to actual vacuum tunneling. All these facts indicate that, even at these very small values of the conductance, tip and sample are still in mechanical contact. At 4K there are some situations (see Fig. 2(b), and the curve on the right hand side in Fig. 2(c)), in which the contact breaks before the subquantum conductance regime. In those cases, the conductance does not display subquantum steps and decreases exponentially as a function elongation, where the effective tunneling barrier φ ≈ 4eV is very close to the expected bismuth work function. A detailed theoretical description of the electrical properties of the contact during elongation is a very difficult task. The effective mass of the charge carriers in Bi varies over a wide range from m * ≈ 0.002m 0 for light electrons to m * ≈ m 0 for heavy electrons (m 0 is the electron mass) and depends on the crystal orientation [12,13]. Moreover, the peculiar electronic properties of bismuth (semimetallic character, band filling, Fermi surface, ...) may also vary with lattice deformations due to the extreme uniaxial strains occurring in small contacts [17] during the elongation-compression processes. The apparent metallic behaviour at 4K can be qualitatively understood in terms of quantum finite size effects [18,14]: as the contact radius R decreases the quantized transversal momentum k n ∝ 1/R increases. This leads to a shift in the subband energy position [14], E n ≈ 2 /(2m * )k 2 n (larger for light carriers) and the gap between light and heavy electrons increases. At low temperatures, there is a transition from light carriers at large cross sections to predominantly heavy electron transport for small cross sections where the light electron states become empty. This qualitative discussion is fully consistent with the analysis of the tunneling regime in mechanical contact (G < G 0 ): The effective barriers in mechanical contact are related to the electron confinement in the constriction. In a free electron picture, the longitudinal momentum of each transversal mode or channel n is given by k zn = K 2 F − k 2 n (with K F = 2π/λ F ) such that to each channel n corresponds a 1D effective potential barrier in the longitudinal direction [9,19]. The modes with k n > K F = (2π/λ F ) are evanescent or tunneling modes. When R < ∼ λ F there is no room even for a single channel and the conductance is dominated by electron tunneling through the first channel with k z1 ≈ ik n ≈ iπ/R. Assuming that the constriction length increases linearly with the elongation Z we will roughly have G ∝ exp(− π R Z). Therefore, in the tunneling regime (before the contact breaks), the slope of ln G as a function of Z gives the order of magnitude of the lateral size of the constriction. Our results then suggest, that, at high temperatures, subquantum steps are related to structural changes of constrictions involving hundreds of atoms (R is a few nanometers). Since the Fermi wavelength is larger or of the order of R, it would also be of the order of a few nanometers. In contrast, at low temperatures subquantum conductance steps can be associated with changes in constrictions consisting of a few atoms (R is now a few Å). This would imply λ F to be one order of magnitude smaller than before. As mentioned above, this qualitative discussion is fully consistent with the behaviour of the G − Z curves in the range of a few conductance quanta. \n\nThe observation of subquantum steps in the G − Z curves provides evidence of atomic rearrangements in the contact. Since these curves are not exactly reproducible from cycle to cycle, conductance quantization effects are difficult to observe from a single elongation curve. After the formation of a given neck, a histogram is obtained from 200 consecutive G − Z curves. In fig. 3(a) we present a set of histograms obtained from different initial necks. As it can be seen, the histograms present peaks close to integer multiples of G which, in contrast with metallic contacts, can be unambiguously associated with conductance quantization effects. In general, we observe that the histogram shape (peak height, number of peaks, ...) changes from neck to neck [15]. This behaviour is clearly different than that observed in some metals (e.g. gold nanocontacts [4]). After averaging over 10 different necks, the resulting histogram (uppermost in Fig. 3a) still shows clear peaks at 1 and 2 conductance quanta which now resemble those of metallic contacts. However, in semimetallic contacts a variation of a few quanta in the conductance requires cross sections much larger than those in metallic ones. Therefore, the mechanical evolution in these systems is expected to be rather different than in metals. For cross sections larger than a few nanometers, yielding occurs as a consequence of collective shear events [20,21] . A qualitative picture of the mechanical evolution can be obtained from a simple model system. We shall restrict ourselves to the tensile loading regime during the elongation of the neck. Suppose that the initial constriction is represented by a cylinder of radius R 0 and consider the deformation process sketched in the inset in Fig. 4(b). The contact is assumed to glide along a symmetry plane that forms an angle θ with respect to the cylinder axis. The maximum elongation Z max before the contact breaks down, is given by Z max = 2R 0 / tan(θ). For a finite elongation Z = Z/Z max , the contact area A shrinks according to (see inset Fig. 4(b)): \n\nInterestingly, the contact loses its axial symmetry and the narrowest section of the contact resembles an elliptical cross section (Fig. 4(b)) with an axis aspect ratio η( Z) ≈ πR 2 0 (1 − Z) 2 /A. An estimation of the transmission coefficients T nm as a function contact elongation can be obtained from a simple model based on the saddlepoint-contact model [22,23]. The geometry of our contact resembles the wide-narrow-wide geometry with 'elliptical' cross section discussed in Ref. [23]. Therefore, T nm can be approximated by: \n\nwhere ǫ nm = (n + 1/2)/ √ η + √ η(m + 1/2) (all the lengths are in units of λ F ), and tan α = (A(0) − A( Z))/π/Z max defines the effective \"opening angle\" [9] of the constriction. The conductance curves are obtained from the Landauer formula, G = nm T nm . 4 together with some experimental results at 77K. In order to mimic the stepped structure, the cross section is assumed to be constant within a lattice parameter of Bi. Experimentally the conductance changes from ≈ 10G 0 to G 0 after an elongation of the contact of the order of 15 nm. Within our model this fixes the Fermi wavelength to be in the nanometer scale, in agreement with the analysis of the subquantum regime. For small Z, i.e. for small opening angles, there is almost no scattering (the T nm 's are 0 or 1). Therefore, the conductance is simply given by the number of propagating channels in the initial contact N 0 , i.e., those nm channels having ǫ nm < √ πA. As the elongation proceeds an interesting interplay between the narrowing of the constriction and the change of degeneracy of transversal modes can be observed. For Z = 0 the contact has cylindrical symmetry and the transversal levels exhibit the well known degeneracy of a parabolic confining potential. Depending on the initial contact cross section, the conductance is then given by 1, 3, 6, 10, . . . G 0 . As Z increases, the cross section decreases and, at the same time, the degree of anisotropy η( Z) also varies, removing the mentioned degeneracy. The conductance behaviour along the elongation path depends critically on the initial conditions of the contact. The theoretical histograms (Fig. 3(b)) strongly depend on the initial cross section and exhibit an overall shape that is very similar to the experimental one. \n\nIn summary, the above experiments provide direct experimental evidence for the presence of conductance quantization in three-dimensional nanocontacts, as well as an experimental exploration of the conductance regime prior to the opening of the first quantum channel. Our results for moderate-sized contacts are well described by a simple model of contact evolution during an elongation process that is based on a gliding mechanism. In agreement with magnetotransport measurements, the differences observed between 77K and 4K curves for G < ∼ G 0 are consistent with a transition from light to heavy electrons at the Fermi level when the contact cross section becomes sufficiently small. Finally, we consider that our work opens a new way to perform experiments on quantum coherence phenomena in atomic scale contacts that up to now were doable with semiconducting heterostructures only. \n\nThis research was supported by the DGICyT (Spain) through grants BFM2000-1470-C02-02, PB98-0464 and PB97-0068. \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n      \n",

    "text": "\nIntroduction\n\nComposite materials have shown distinct characteristics in term of strength and weight in such a way that all industries in general and aerospace industry in particular are drifting towards modifying their manufacturing processes and using composite materials in their product development. Helicopter blades are also made of composites (Alkahe & Rand, 2000;Azzam & Andrew, 1992;Morozov, Sylantiev, & Evseev, 2003;Shahid & Chang, 1995). Operating conditions of helicopter rotor are unsteady aerodynamic and acceleration/deceleration loads leading to harsh loading conditions. This may lead to induce damage in the composite material of the rotor. Therefore, progressive failure of helicopter rotor under dynamic loading conditions has attained significant attention of researchers. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the work, few authors have investigated failure analysis. Modal data has been used by some authors to check damage in rotor blades (Pawar & Ganguli, 2003;Alkahe, Rand, & Oshman, 2003). Experimental studies, even more difficult aspect, have been investigated by few authors (Cattarius & Inman, 2000;Gho-shal et al., 2001;Kiddy & Pines, 2001). One way of composite damage modeling is by some percentage reduction in the bending and torsional stiffnesses while some have gone through crack modeling based on fracture mechanics approach (Ganguli, 2002). With the availability of light weight, high strength composite materials, it was felt to perform detailed modeling of damage modes in composite rotor blades. Notable efforts have been done by Pawar and Ganguli (2005) considering ply laminates and matrix cracking was the initial damage observed. Gudmundson and Weilin (1993), Adolfsson and Gudmundson (1997) have investigated generalized composite laminates under combined loading consisting of bending and axial loading. When the matrix cracking effect starts saturating, a local de-lamination can initiate from the matrix crack tips. The de-lamination induced due to matrix cracking was modeled in the literature using various approaches such as classical plate theory (Obrien, 1991), first-order shear deformation laminate plate theory (Armanios, Sriram, & Badir, 1991), variation techniques (Nairn & Hu, 1992), shear lag techniques (Dharani & Tang, 1990) and 3-D finite element analysis of 90° lamina (Salpekar & O'Brien, 1991). Most recently, the shear lag method was applied by Berthelot and Corre (2000) to analyze the stress fields in cross-ply laminates containing transverse cracks and crack tip de-lamination with shear friction between the delaminated plies. While several researchers have modeled separate damage modes as discussed above, few researchers have modeled the progressive damage accumulation in composite structures (Allen, Harris, & Groves, 1987). Most of these models are focused on characterization of cracking in a single sub-laminate with 90° plies. However, under realistic loading condition matrix cracks can appear in all plies and in a multi-directional laminate and may lead to laminate failure by de-lamination or fiber breakage. Such a model was proposed by Shahid and Chang (1995) for predicting the accumulated damage and studied the effect of such damage on the in-plane response of laminated composite plates subjected to tensile and shear loads. \n\nProgressive damage of moderately thick composite laminated plates has been investigated by Ghannadpour and Shakeri (2018) considering in-plane compressive load and uniform lateral pressure. Under same loading conditions, Ghannadpour (Mehrparvar & Ghannadpour, 2018;Ghannadpour & Mehrparvar, 2018) presented analysis of laminate with different shapes and size cut-outs. The concept of minimum potential energy was used for the formulations. Hashin failure criteria have been used to predict the location of failure. Post buckling analysis of cracked imperfect composite plates has been explored by Ghannadpour and Karimi (2018). Progressive damage and nonlinear geometric analysis of relatively thick laminates has been presented by Ghannadpour et al. (2018), Ghannadpour and Shakeri (2018). Two different versions of finite strip method have been used by Ovesy et al. (2006) to predict geometrically nonlinear behavior of composite laminate under progressive end-shortening and to pressure loading. Three geometric degradation models have been employed to estimate the degradation zone around the failure location. Using classical plate theory and first order shear deformation theory, Dawe, Lam, and Azizian (1993) has described the analysis geometrically nonlinear composite laminate behavior to predict local buckling. Ovesy and Ghannadpour (2006) and (Ovesy, Ghannadpour, & Zia-Dehkordi), have used exact finite strip method to predict buckling analysis of moderately thick composite laminate. In their further work, Ghannadpour (Ovesy, Totounferoush, & Ghannadpour, 2015;Ghannadpour & Ovesy, 2009) and Ghannadpour et al. (2014) have presented de-lamination and dynamic buckling of composite laminate using semi analytical finite strip and exact finite strip methods. Other authors (Oktay & Sal, 2015, 2016;Oktay & Sultan, 2013) have also explained active and passive control and helicopter rotor blade morphing for energy efficiency. \n\nFrom the presented literature review, it is revealed that noticeable work has been done by several authors on the geometry and control of the helicopter rotor blade, how-ever, aeroelastic loading, centrifugal loads and their effect on the composite laminate structure along with failure mode prediction is the inter-disciplinary area in which not enough work has been done. The same has been explored in the current work. \n\nIn the present work, a composite helicopter rotor blade (Pawar & Ganguli, 2006) using shell and solid elements has been used. Progressive failure analysis (PFA) has been performed under static aeroelastic loading. Aerodynamic loads are calculated using strip theory. As the velocity is increased so does the load and hence damage is modeled with progressive increase in the load. (Helicopter blade is rotating and hence its vibration modes will be different with that at wind off conditions this effect has been accounted by axial loading of the blade and calculating pre-stressed modes). The key damage modes in composite structure such as matrix cracking, de-lamination and fiber breakage are modeled. The effect of progressive damage accumulation on the composite helicopter rotor blade in forward flight is investigated using a two-cell airfoil section-beam with stiffness properties representing a stiff inplane helicopter rotor blade. \n\nFormulations\n\nVariation formulation\n\nHelicopter blade undergoes flap (out-of-plane) bending, lag (in-plane) bending, elastic twist and axial displacement Using a generalized Hamilton's principal applicable to non-conservative systems (Pawar & Ganguli, 2007) is given as \n\nThe δU and δT include energy contributions from components that are attached to the blade, e.g., pitch link, lag damper, etc. After finite element discretization, Hamilton's principle is written as \n\nAssembling the blade finite element equations and applying boundary conditions in Eq results in the final form of equation ( 3), where {x} and {f} are defined in equation ( 4) \n\n(4) \n\nAerodynamic, inertia and centrifugal forces\n\nHelicopter rotor blade is subjected to lift, gravity and centrifugal forces making its structural and aeroelastic analysis difficult. Gravity force acts downward, lift upward while centrifugal force acts radially outward as shown in Figure 1. The lifting force on a rotating blade is related to its local angle of attack and local dynamic pressure. There is velocity distribution on the blade, zero flow velocity at the rotational axis and the maximum at the tip. Moreover, geometrical twist angle increases from tip to root. \n\nAlthough, the velocity is maximum at the tip, lift is not maximum at the tip because of tip vortices. Lift produced by rotating blade may be described by Blade Element Theory (BET) as Eq. \n\n( \n\nhere, the velocity V, and angle of attack α, are the function of blade radius r. BET assumes no influence of adjacent blade elements section. Moreover, non-uniform induced flow across the blade is obtained through a distribution of geometrical twist along the blade span. Linear geometrical twist has been assumed as given in Figure 2 in the current study. Assumed velocity and lift distributions at 15 rad/ sec are shown in Figure 3. Composite materials are used for the manufacturing of helicopter rotor blade. As the density is assigned to a particular laminate, its mass is calculated by the finite element software through its volume. \n\nGravity force can then be applied globally and the same has been considered in current work. As the helicopter rotor blade rotates, centrifugal force act on the blade radially whose magnitude, mω 2 r, is much more than the gravity and lift force even at low rotation speed. Centrifugal force has been applied using the parameter of rotation speed, ω. \n\nProgressive damage model\n\nThe progressive damage model involves the steps of stress analysis, failure analysis and material properties degradation. These steps, which operate in an iterative procedure following the mentioned order, were incorporated into ANSYS code using APDL. Stress analysis was performed numerically using the commercial Finite Element code ANSYS which can provide the ply-by-ply calculated stresses to be used as input to progressive model. Failure analysis was performed by implementing the commonly used Hashin polynomial failure criteria. These criteria were selected because they can distinguish between different failure modes and may be applied with ease in a finite element formulation. \n\nOnce failure is detected in a ply, the material properties of the ply are degraded by implementing a sudden degradation rule. The scope of using degradation rules is to disable the ply from carrying a certain load. Thus, for each mode of failure there exists a corresponding degradation rule. The available ply-b-ply material property degradation rules are empirical and include assumptions resulting from engineering constraints in the properties of composite materials. \n\nFEA calculation process\n\nThe previously described steps of progressive model were programmed into an ANSYS parametric macro-routine, which works iteratively. The macro-routine involves the following steps. \n\n1. Generating 3-D model of rotor blade by giving as input the initial material properties, specimen geometry, boundary conditions and initial loads. 2. Performing non-linear stress analysis and calculation of the on-axis stresses for each ply. Non-linear stress analysis with the same load is performed again in order to calculate the redistributed stresses. Convergence at a load step is assumed when no additional failures are detected. 11. Repeating the procedure until final failure occurs. The progressive damage model was implemented for rotor blade in order to evaluate its residual strength under incremental tensile loading. \n\nFailure models\n\nFailure criteria compare the loading state at a point with a set of values reflecting the strength of the material at that point (often referred to as the material allowable). For unidirectional materials, this is typically in the direction of the fibers. \n\nIn general, the load is represented by a full stress or strain tensor having six independent components. By convention, for lamina materials the material X axis lies in the direction of the warp fibers while the Z axis lies in the through-thickness direction of the sheet. \n\nDamage criteria and degradation rules\n\nHashin damage criteria in the destruction of the fiber pull-off formula is given in (Tserpes et al., 2002). Damage criteria for fiber pull-out failure mode: \n\nFiber tensile failure is given as: \n\nFiber compressive failure is given as: \n\nMatrix tensile failure is given as: \n\nMatrix compressive failure is given as: \n\nFiber matrix shear failure is given as: \n\nDelamination failure mode under tensile loading is given as: \n\nDelamination failure mode under compression load is given as: \n\nComputational model\n\nIn this study, structural model of a hypothetical helicopter blade as described by Pawar and Ganguli (2006), Pawar and Ganguli (2007) et al., 2013) along with 2 mm balsa web placed at 35% of the chord as shown in Figure 4. Fixed boundary conditions were applied at the root end. Keeping in view the magnitude of centrifugal force which is much higher than the rest of the two forces, failure modes and the first ten modes of vibration (six flap, two lag, two torsion and no axial) have been evaluated with and without centrifugal forces. Figure 5 shows D-spar, shear web and the skin in the finite element model. \n\nFinite element model validation\n\nIn \n\nResults and discussion\n\nAn APDL code has been developed in ANSYS environment putting finite element structural model, lift, gravity, centrifugal forces and the composite failure criteria at one place making the code attractive for the solution of any practical problem. To demonstrate the capability of the code, benchmark hypothetical helicopter blade geometry was chosen and its structural model was validated in the last section. Nonlinear tip deflection matches closely to that of the literature value. There are three types of loadings a helicopter rotor blade experiences during its normal operation which are gravity, lift and centrifugal forces. \n\nFailure modes have been predicted first considering gravity and lift forces, later the centrifugal force is also added to see the combined effect. \n\nIn the first case, gravity and lift forces were applied as both act in the opposite direction. Lift force was varied through rotational speed. Five speeds were considered i.e., 11-15 rad/sec. As the speed is changed, lift force computed through BET is changed; however, gravity force remains constant. Failure in the composite materials is predicted through the failure criteria. Corresponding mode changes have also been computed. No failure is observed as the rotation speed of 11 rad/sec and 12 rad/sec is kept, however, failure is observed near the root section at 13 rad/sec as shown in Figure 7. Nodes plotted in black color experience no failure while matrix cracking was computed at the red plotted nodes. The composite damage progressively increases near the root section as the speed is increased to 14 rad/sec and 15 rad/sec as shown in Figures 8 and Figure 9. As the tip deflection increases with the increase of rotational speed, there is stress stiffening effect in the blade. This behavior is obvious from the plot of first 10 modes in Figure 10. As the rotational speed is set to 11 rad/sec, frequencies of all modes increase; however, there is no further stress stiffening as the speed is further increased from11 rad/sec to 15 rad/sec. In the next computational scheme, centrifugal force is also added along with lift and gravity forces. Out of plane deflections and twist about span axis with and without centrifugal force are shown in Figures 11 and Figure 12. It is obvious from the figures that centrifugal force acts as the stabilizing force and deflection/twist values have reduced in presence of centrifugal force. Moreover, no failure is observed as the rotational speeds are changed from 11 rad/sec to 15 rad/sec. Modal data is plotted in Figure 13. The trend of all modes remains the same as in absence of centrifugal force, however, there is more stress stiffening and hence frequencies at 11 rad/sec is more than those in absence of centrifugal force. Moreover, as expected there is axial and chord wise deformations, although smaller in magnitude, in the presence of centrifugal force as shown in Figures 14 and Figure 15. It can be observed from these figures that magnitude of centrifugal force generated at such low rotational speed, i.e., 15 rad/sec, is quite high as compared to lift, gravity and chord wise force. In actual operation, rotational speed is quite high than this value and hence centrifugal force consideration plays central role in the design of rotating machinery blade. \n\nConclusions\n\nHelicopter rotor blade is subjected to complex aerodynamic loading and therefore, its structural design is of utmost importance. To get high performance of helicopter, rotors are being manufactured from composite materials. Unlike metal structures, composite materials failure modes are complex and no clue is given by these structures before their failure. Hence, investigation of composite structures failure modes has gained popularity in the recent research. \n\nIn the present work, an APDL code in ANSYS environment has been generated encompassing structural model of composite laminate and failure criteria of composites along with gravity, lift and centrifugal forces at one place making the code very attractive for the nonlinear static solution of practical problems. To demonstrate the code capability, a hypothetical helicopter rotor blade from the literature was selected and structural model was validated through the comparison of deflections. It is subjected to gravity and lift forces and failure modes were observed because of out of plane deflections. It was realized that damage starts near the root section and it was matrix cracking. Modal data predicted a stress stiffening effect and hence frequency values of first 10 modes increased. Centrifugal force was further added by rotating the structures at different speeds. It was realized that centrifugal force acted as a stabilizing agent as it restricted the out of plane deflections during the axial rotations. Hence no failure was observed in the presence of centrifugal force on the given speeds. Modal results indicated further stress stiffening and frequency values for first 10 modes further increased. Additionally, the trend of increasing frequency values for bending and torsion with increasing speed is same. In the future work, dynamic analysis will be incorporated to make the code more realistic for practical problems of rotating machinery. It is pertinent to mention that although all possible failure models have been incorporated in APDL code, it is not necessary that all failure modes have been experienced. It depends on the loading conditions and their magnitude. However, it is clarified that as the matrix failure is observed in specific region, stiffness of that region goes to zero and it is not further able to withstand the load. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n",

(Gendler et al., 2022) provided a certified method for conformal prediction by applying randomized smoothing to certify the non-conformity scores.However, such certified coverage could be loose due to the generic nature of randomized smoothing.We propose COLEP with a sensing-reasoning framework to achieve much stronger certified coverage by leveraging the knowledge-enabled logic reasoning capabilities.We provide a comprehensive literature review on certified robustness and logical reasoning in appendix B.\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n\nSuppose that we have n data samples {(Xi, Yi)} n i=1 with features Xi ∈ R d and labels Yi ∈ Y := {1, 2, ..., Nc}.Assume that the data samples are drawn exchangeably from some unknown distribution PXY .Given a desired coverage 1 − α ∈ (0, 1), conformal prediction methods construct a prediction set Ĉn,α ⊆ Y for a new data sample (Xn+1, Yn+1) ∼ PXY with the guarantee of marginal prediction coverage: P[Yn+1 ∈ Ĉn,α(Xn+1)] ≥ 1 − α.\n\nIn this work, we focus on the split conformal prediction setting (Lei et al., 2018;Solari & Djordjilović, 2022), where the data samples are randomly partitioned into two disjoint sets: a training set Itr and a calibration set Using the estimated probabilities that we denote by πy(x), we then compute a non-conformity score S πy (Xi, Yi) for each sample in the calibration set Ical to measure how much non-conformity each validation sample has with respect to its ground truth label.A commonly used non-conformity score for valid and adaptive coverage is introduced by (Romano et al., 2020) as: S πy (x, y) = j∈Y πj(x)I[π j (x)>πy (x)] + πy(x)u, where I [•] is the indicator function and u is uniformly sampled over the interval [0,1].Given a desired coverage 1 − α, the prediction set of a new data point Xn+1 is formulated as:\n\nĈn,α (X n+1 ) = {y ∈ Y : S πy (X n+1 , y)\n\nwhere Q1−α({S πy (Xi, Yi)}i∈I cal ) is the ⌈(1−α)(1+|Ical|)⌉-th largest value of the set {S πy (Xi, Yi)}i∈I cal .\n\nThe prediction set Ĉn,α(Xn+1) includes all the labels with a smaller non-conformity score than the (1 − α)-quantile of scores in the calibration set.Since we assume the data samples are exchangeable, the marginal coverage of the prediction set Ĉn,α(Xn+1) is no less than 1 − α.\n\nLEARNING-REASONING PIPELINE FOR CONFORMAL PREDICTION\n\nTo achieve high certified prediction coverage against adversarial perturbations, we introduce the certifiably robust learning-reasoning conformal prediction framework (COLEP).For better readability, we provide structured tables for used notations through the analysis in Appendix K.\n\nfor l ∈ [L] Once the learning models output their predictions along with estimated probabilities, the reasoning component accepts these estimates as input and passes them through R distinct reasoning subcomponents in parallel.It then combines the probabilities at the outputs of the reasoning subcomponents to calculate the corrected estimates of conditional class probabilities by COLEP, which we denote as πCOLEP j (x) for j ∈ [Nc] (e.g., corrected probability of x having a stop sign or not:\n\nand form the conformal prediction set with them.\n\nREASONING VIA PROBABILISTIC CIRCUITS\n\nWe encode two types of knowledge in the reasoning component: (1) preventive knowledge of the form \"A =⇒ B\" (e.g., \"IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon\"), and (2) permissive knowledge of the form \"B =⇒ A\" (e.g., \"HasContentStop =⇒ IsStopSign\"), where A represents the main task corresponding to the main model (e.g., \"IsStopSign\"), B as one of the L knowledge models (e.g., \"IsOctagon\"), and =⇒ denotes logical implication with a conditional variable as the left operand and a consequence variable on the right.In this part, we consider one particular reasoning subcomponent (i.e., one PC) and encode H preventive and permissive knowledge rules\n\nTo enable exact and efficient reasoning, we need to seek for appropriate probabilistic models as the reasoning component.Recent work (Gürel et al., 2021;Yang et al., 2022) encode propositional logic rules with Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) (Richardson & Domingos, 2006), but the inference complexity is exponential regarding the number of knowledge models.Variational inference is efficient for reaonsing (Zhang et al., 2023), but induces error during reasoning.Thus, we use probabilistic circuits (PCs) to achieve better trade-offs between the model expressiveness and reasoning efficiency.\n\nEncode preventive and permissive knowledge rules with PCs.PCs define a joint distribution over a set of random variables.PCs take an assignment of the random variables as input and output the joint probability of the assignment.Specifically, the input of PCs can be represented by an Nc + L sized vector of Bernoulli random variables (e.g., [IsStopSign, IsOctagon, IsRed, IsDigit]) with the corresponding vector of success probabilities (e.g., π = [πs, πo , πr , πd ]) denoted as:\n\nNote that π is a concatenated vector of the estimated conditional class and concept probabilities of the main model and knowledge models, respectively (e.g., π = [πs, πo , πr , πd ] with Nc = 1, L = 2).Since conformal prediction is our main focus, the conditional probabilities π in eq. ( 4) will be frequently referenced throughout the paper.To distinguish the index representing each class label The output of a PC is typically the root node Oroot representing the joint probability of an assignment (e.g., p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 1|x)).The graph G contains internal sum nodes computing a convex combination of children nodes, and product nodes computing the product of them.\n\nFormally, we let the leaf node O (j ∀ ) leaf in the computational graph G be a Bernoulli distribution with success probability πj ∀ (x).Let µ ∈ M := {0, 1} Nc+L be the index variable (not an observation) of a possible assignment for Nc classes in the interest of the main model and L concepts in the interest of L knowledge models.We also define the factor function F : {0, 1} Nc+L → R + which takes as input a possible assignment µ and outputs the factor value of the assignment:\n\nwhere I [µ∼K h ] = 1 indicates that the assignment µ follows the given logic rule K h , and otherwise\n\n, where K is the rule \"IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon\" with weight w).F (µ) essentially measures how well the assignment µ conforms to the specified knowledge rules.Following (Darwiche, 2002;2003), we let sum nodes compute the logical \"or\" operation, and product nodes compute the logical \"and\" operation.We associate each assignment µ ∈ M with the factor value F (µ) at the level of leaf nodes as fig. 1.Given a feasible assignment of random variables, the output of PC Oroot computes the likelihood of the assignment (e.g., p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctogon = 1|x)).When considering the likelihood of the j-th class label, we can marginalize class labels other than j and formulate the class probability conditioned on input x as:\n\nwhere\n\nfor simplicity of notations and µj denotes the j-th element of vector µ.Note that the numerator and denominator of eq. ( 6) can be exactly and efficiently computed with a single forwarding pass of PCs (Hitzler & Sarker, 2022;Choi & Darwiche, 2017;Rooshenas & Lowd, 2014).We can also improve the expressiveness of the reasoning component by linearly combining outputs of R PCs π(r) j with coefficients βr for the r-th PC as\n\n. The core of this formulation is the mixture model involving a latent variable rPC representing the PCs.In short, we can write πCOLEP j (x) as the marginalized probability over the latent variable rPC as\n\nHence, the coefficient βr for the r-th PC are determined by P[rPC = r].Although we lack direct knowledge of this probability, we can estimate it using the data by examining how frequently each PC r correctly predicts the outcome across the given examples, similarly as in the estimation of prior class probabilities for Naive Bayes classifiers.Illustrative example.We open up the stop sign classification example in fig. 1 further as follows.\n\nThe main model predicts that the image x has a stop sign with probability πs(x).In parallel to it, the knowledge model that detects octagon shape predicts that the image x has an object with octagon shape with probability πo(x).Then we can encode the logic rule \"IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon\" with weight w as fig. 1.The reasoning component can correct the output probability with encoded knowledge rules and improve the robustness of the prediction.Consider the following concrete example.Suppose that the adversarial example of a speed limit sign misleads the main classifier to detect it as a stop sign with a large probability (e.g., πs = 0.9), but the octagon classifier is not misled and correctly predicts that the speed limit sign has a square shape (e.g., πo = 0.0).Then according the computation as eq.( 6), the corrected probability of detecting a stop sign given the attacked speed limit image is πCOLEP s = 0.9/(0.1ew + 0.9), which is down-weighted from the original wrong prediction πs = 0.9 as we have a positive logical rule weight w > 0. Therefore, the reasoning component can correct the wrong output probabilities with the knowledge rules and lead to a more robust prediction framework.\n\nCONFORMAL PREDICTION WITH COLEP\n\nAfter obtaining the corrected conditional class probabilities using COLEP in eq. ( 6), we move on to conformal prediction with COLEP.To begin with, we construct prediction sets for each class label within the learning component.Using eq. ( 1), the prediction set for the j-th class, where j ∈ [Nc], can be formulated as:\n\nwhere 1 − αj is the user-defined coverage level, similar to α in the standard conformal prediction.The fact that element 1 is present in Xn+1) signifies that the class label j is a possible ground truth label for Xn+1 and can be included in the final prediction set.That is:\n\nwhere α = max j∈[Nc] {αj}.It is worth noting that if αj is set to a fixed value for all j ∈ [Nc], α in the standard conformal prediction setting is recovered.In this work, we adopt a fixed α for each αj for simplicity, but note that our framework allows setting different miscoverage levels for each class j, which is advantageous in addressing imbalanced classes.We defer more discussions on the flexibility of defining class-wise coverage levels to Appendix D.1.\n\nCERTIFIABLY ROBUST LEARNING-REASONING CONFORMAL PREDICTION\n\nIn this section, we provide robustness certification of COLEP for conformal prediction.We start by providing the certification of the reasoning component in Section 4.1, and then move to end-to-end certified coverage as well as finite-sample certified coverage in Section 4.2.We defer all the proofs to Appendix.The overview of the certification framework is provided in fig. 4 in Appendix E.\n\nCERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK AND CERTIFICATION OF THE REASONING COMPONENT\n\nThe inference time adversaries violate the data exchangeability assumption, compromising the guaranteed coverage.With COLEP, we aim to investigate (1) whether the guaranteed coverage can be preserved for COLEP using a prediction set that takes the perturbation bound into account, and (2) whether we can provide a worst-case coverage (a lower bound) using the standard prediction set as before in eq. ( 8).We provide certification for goal (1) and (2) in Thms. 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nThe certification procedure can be decomposed into several subsequent stages.First, we certify learning robustness by deriving the bounds for π within the learning component given the input perturbation bound δ.There are several existing approaches to certify the robustness of models within this component (Cohen et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2018;Gowal et al., 2018).In this work, we use randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) (details in Appendix C.3), and get the bound of π under the perturbation.Next, we certify reasoning robustness by deriving the reasoning-corrected bounds using the bounds of the learning component (Thm.1).Finally, we certify the robustness of conformal prediction considering the reasoning-corrected bounds (Thm. 2 and Thm.3).\n\nAs robustness of the learning component is performed using randomized smoothing, we directly focus on the robustness certification of reasoning component.\n\nTheorem 1 (Bounds for Conditional Class Probabilities πCOLEP j (x) within the Reasoning Component).Given any input x and perturbation bound δ, we let [πj ∀ (x), πj ∀ (x)] be bounds for the estimated conditional class and concept probabilities by all models with j ∀ ∈ [Nc + L] (for example, achieved via randomized smoothing).Let V j d be the set of index of conditional variables in the PC except for j ∈ [Nc] and V j s be that of consequence variables.Then the bound for COLEP-corrected estimate of the conditional class probability πCOLEP j is given by:\n\nCERTIFIABLY ROBUST CONFORMAL PREDICTION\n\nIn this section, we leverage the reasoning component bounds in Thm. 1 to perform calibration with a worst-case non-conformity score function for adversarial perturbations.This way, we perform certifiably robust conformal prediction in the adversary setting during the inference time.We formulate the procedure to achieve this in Thm. 2. Theorem 2 (Certifiably Robust Conformal Prediction of COLEP).Consider a new test sample Xn+1 drawn from PXY .For any bounded perturbation ∥ϵ∥2 ≤ δ in the input space and the adversarial sample Xn+1 := Xn+1 + ϵ, we have the following guaranteed marginal coverage:\n\nif we construct the certified prediction set of COLEP where\n\nand S πCOLEP δ j (•, •) is a function of worst-case non-conformity score considering perturbation radius δ:\n\nwith U δ [π COLEP Remarks.Thm. 2 shows that the coverage guarantee of COLEP in the adversary setting is still valid (eq.( 10)) if we construct the prediction set by considering the worst-case perturbation as in eq. ( 11).That is, the prediction set of COLEP in eq. ( 11) covers the ground truth of an adversarial sample with nominal level 1 − α.To achieve that, we use a worst-case non-conformity score as in eq. ( 12) during calibration to counter the influence of adversarial sample during inference.The bound of output probability\n\n) in eq. ( 12) can be computed by Thm. 1 to achieve end-to-end robustness certification of COLEP, which generally holds for any DNN and probabilistic circuits.We also consider the finite-sample errors of using randomized smoothing for the learning component certification as Anonymous (2023) and provided the theoretical statement and proofs in thm.6 in Appendix F.3.Theorem 3 (Certified (Worst-Case) Coverage of COLEP).Consider the new sample Xn+1 drawn from PXY and adversarial sample Xn+1 := Xn+1 + ϵ with any perturbation ∥ϵ∥2 ≤ δ in the input space.We have:\n\nwhere the certified (worst-case) coverage of the j-th class label τ COLEPcer j is formulated as:\n\nRemarks.Thm. 2 constructs a certified prediction set with 1 − α coverage as eq.( 11) by considering the worst-case perturbation during calibration to counter the influence of test-time adversaries.In contrast, Thm. 3 targets the case when we still adopt a standard calibration process without the consideration of test-time perturbations, which would lead to a lower coverage than 1 − α and Thm. 3 concretely shows the formulation of the worst-case coverage.Thm. 3 presents the formulations of the lower bound of the coverage (τ COLEPcer j ) with the standard prediction set as eq.( 8) in the adversary setting.In addition to the certified coverage, we consider finite calibration set size and certified coverage with finite sample errors in Appendix G.\n\nIn Section 5.3, we theoretically show that COLEP achieves better coverage and prediction accuracy than a single main model as long as the utility of knowledge models and rules (characterized in Section 5.1) is non-trivial.To achieve it, we provide a connection between those utilities and the effectiveness of PCs in Section 5.2.The certification overview is provided in fig. 4  Let Ar(j ∀ ) be the set of nodes in the connected component of node j ∀ in graph G r .Let A r,d (j ∀ ) ⊆ Ar(j ∀ ) be the set of conditional variables and Ar,s(j ∀ ) ⊆ Ar(j ∀ ) be the set of consequence variables.For any sample x, let ν(x) ∈ [0, 1] Nc+L be the Boolean vector of ground truth class and concepts such that ν(x\n\n. We denote ν(x) as ν when sample x is clear in the context.For simplicity, we assume a fixed weight w ∈ R + for all knowledge rules in the analysis.In what follows, we characterize the prediction capability of each model (main or knowledge) and establish a relation between these characteristics and the prediction performance of COLEP.\n\nFor each class and concept probability estimated by learning models πj ∀ ∈[Nc+L] : R d → [0, 1] (recall eq. ( 4)), we have the following definition:\n\nwhere tj ∀ ,D , zj ∀ ,D are parameters quantifying quality of the main model and knowledge models in predicting correct class and concept, respectively.In particular, tj ∀ ,D characterizes the threshold of confidence whereas zj ∀ ,D quantifies the probability matching this threshold over data distribution D. Specifically, models with a large tj ∀ ,D , zj ∀ ,D imply that the model outputs a small class probability when the ground truth of input is 0 and a large class probability when the ground truth of input is 1, indicating the model performs well on prediction.We define the combined utility of models within r-th PC by using individual model qualities.For j-th class, we have:\n\nand the utility of associated knowledge rules within r-th PC for the j-th class as:\n\nwhere P d (j) and Ps(j) are PC index sets where j appears as conditional and consequence variables.\n\nquantifies the utility of knowledge rules for class j.Consider the case where j corresponds to a conditional variable in the r-th PC.Small U (r) j indicates that P [νj ∀ = 1, ∀j ∀ ∈ Ar,s(j) |νj = 0 ] is high, hence implication rules for j ∀ are universal and of low utility.\n\nEFFECTIVENESS OF THE REASONING COMPONENT WITH PCS\n\nHere we theoretically build the connection between the utility of knowledge models T (r) j ∀ ,D , Z (r) j ∀ ,D and the utility of implication rules U (r) j ∀ with the effectiveness of reasoning components.We quantify the effectiveness of the reasoning component as the relative confidence in ground truth class probabilities.Specifically, we expect E πCOLEP j (X) − πj(X) |Y = j to be large for j ∈ [Nc] as it enables COLEP to correct the prediction of the main model, especially in the adversary setting.Lemma 5.1 (Effectiveness of the Reasoning Component).For any class probability within models j ∈ [Nc] and data sample (X, Y ) drawn from the mixture distribution Dm, we can prove that:\n\nwhere λ (r) j,D = (1/T (r) j,D + e −w − 1) and we shorthand πj(X) as πj.\n\nRemarks.Lemma 5.1 analyzes the relative confidence of the ground truth class probabilities after corrections with the reasoning component.Towards that, we consider different cases based on the utility of the models and knowledge rules described earlier and combine conditional upper bounds with probabilities.We can quantify the effectiveness of the reasoning component with ϵj,0, ϵj,1 since non-trivial ϵj,0, ϵj,1 can correct the confidence of ground truth class in the expected direction and benefit conformal prediction by inducing a smaller non-conformity score for an adversarial sample.Then we have:\n\n] are class probabilities on benign distribution.Remarks.Thm. 4 shows that COLEP can achieve better marginal coverage than a single model with a high probability exponentially approaching 1.The probability increases in particular with a higher quality of models represented by ϵj,1,D a , ϵj,c,D b , A(πj, D b ).ϵj,1,D a , ϵj,c,D b quantifies the effectiveness of the correction of the reasoning component and is positively correlated with the utility of models\n\nj,D and the utility of knowledge rules U (r) j as shown in Lemma 5.1, indicating that better knowledge models and rules benefits a higher prediction coverage with COLEP.The probability also increases with lower accuracy on the adversarial distribution A(πj, Da), indicating COLEP improves marginal coverage more likely in a stronger adversary setting.Theorem 5 (Comparison of Prediction Accuracy of COLEP and Main Model).Suppose that we evaluate the expected prediction accuracy of πCOLEP j (•) and πj(•) on n samples drawn from Dm and denote the prediction accuracy as A(π COLEP j (•), Dm) and A(πj(•), Dm).Then we have:\n\nRemarks.Thm. 5 shows that COLEP achieves better prediction accuracy than the main model with a high probability exponentially approaching 1.The probability increases with more effectiveness of the reasoning component quantified by a large ϵj,c,D, which positively correlates to the utility of models T (r) j,D , Z (r) j,D and the utility of knowledge rules U (r) j as shown in Lemma 5.1, indicating that better knowledge models and rules benefits a higher prediction accuracy with COLEP.In Appendix I, we further show that COLEP achieves higher prediction accuracy with more useful knowledge rules.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nWe evaluate COLEP on certified conformal prediction in the adversarial setting on various datasets, including GTSRB (Stallkamp et al., 2012), CIFAR-10, and AwA2 (Xian et al., 2018).For fair comparisons, we use the same model architecture and parameters in COLEP and baselines CP (Romano et al., 2020) andRSCP (Gendler et al., 2022).The desired coverage is set 0.9 across evaluations.Note that we leverage randomized smoothing for learning component certification (100k Monte-Carlo sampling) and consider the finite-sample errors of RSCP following Anonymous (2023) and that of COLEP following Thm.6.We fix weights w as 1.5 and provide more details in Appendix J. Construction of the reasoning component.In each PC, we encode a type of implication knowledge with disjoint attributes.In GTSRB, we have a PC of shape knowledge (e.g.,\"octagon\", \"square\"), a PC of boundary color knowledge (e.g., \"red boundary\", \"black boundary\"), and a PC of content knowledge (e.g., \"digit 50\", \"turn left\").Specifically, in the PC of shape knowledge, we can encode the implication rules such as IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon (stop signs are octagon), IsSpeedLimit =⇒ IsSquare (speed limit signs are square).In summary, we have 3 PCs and 28 knowledge rules in GTSRB, 3 PCs and 30 knowledge rules in CIFAR-10, and 4 PCs and 187 knowledge rules in AwA2.\n\nWe also provide detailed steps of PC construction in appendix J.1.Certified Coverage under Bounded Perturbations.We evaluate the certified coverage of COLEP given a new test sample X n+1 with bounded perturbation ϵ (|ϵ| 2 < δ) based on our certification in Thm. 3. Certified coverage indicates the worst-case coverage during inference in the adversary setting, hence a higher certified coverage indicates a more robust conformal prediction and tigher certification.We compare the certified coverage of COLEP with the SOTA baseline RSCP (Theorem 2 in (Gendler et al., 2022)).The comparison of certified coverage between COLEP and RSCP is provided in Figure 2. The results indicate that COLEP consistently achieves higher certified coverage under different ℓ 2 norm bounded perturbations, and COLEP outperforms RSCP by a large margin under a large perturbation radius δ = 0.5.Note that an obvious upper bound of the certified coverage in the adversary setting is the guaranteed coverage without an adversary, which is 0.9 in the evaluation.\n\nThe closeness between the certified coverage of COLEP τ COLEP (cer)\n\nand the upper bound of coverage guarantee τ (cer) shows the robustness of COLEP and tightness of our certification.Prediction Coverage and Prediction Set Size under Adversarial Attacks.We also evaluate the marginal coverage and averaged set size of COLEP and baselines under adversarial attacks.COLEP constructs the certifiably robust prediction set following Thm. 2. We compare the results with the standard conformal prediction (CP) and the SOTA conformal prediction with randomized smoothing (RSCP).For fair comparisons, we apply PGD attack (Madry et al., 2018) with the same parameters on CP, RSCP, and COLEP.For COLEP, we consider the adaptive PGD attack against the complete learning-reasoning pipeline.The comparison of the marginal coverage and averaged set size for CP, RSCP, and COLEP under PGD attack (δ = 0.25) is provided in Figure 3.The results indicate that the marginal coverage of CP is below the nominal coverage level 0.9 under PGD attacks as data exchangeability is violated, while COLEP still achieves higher marginal coverage than the nominal level, validating the robustness of COLEP for conformal prediction in the adversary setting.Compared with RSCP, COLEP achieves both larger marginal coverage and smaller set size, demonstrating that COLEP maintains the guaranteed coverage with less inflation of the prediction set.The observation validates our theoretical analysis in Thm. 4 that COLEP can achieve better coverage than a single model with the power of kwowledge-enabled logical reasoning.We provide more evaluations of different coverage levels 1 − α, different perturbation bound δ, different conformal prediction baselines, and contributions of different knowledge rules in Appendix J.2.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we present COLEP, a certifiably robust conformal prediction framework via knowledge-enabled logical reasoning.We leverage PCs for efficient reasoning and provide robustness certification.We also provide end-to-end certification for finite-sample certified coverage in the presence of adversaries and theoretically prove the advantage of COLEP over a single model.We included the discussions of limitations, broader impact, and future work in Appendix A.\n\nK Overview of notations\n\nA DISCUSSIONS, BROADER IMPACT, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK Broader Impact.In this paper, we propose a certifiably robust conformal prediction framework COLEP via knowledge-enabled logic reasoning.We prove that for any adversarial test sample with ℓ 2 -norm bounded perturbations, the prediction set of COLEP captures the ground truth label with a guaranteed coverage level.Considering distribution shifts during inference time and weakening the assumption of data exchangeability has been an active area of conformal prediction.COLEP demonstrates both theoretical and empirical improvements in the adversarial setting and can inspire future work to explore various types of distribution shifts with the power of logical reasoning and the certification framework of COLEP.Furthermore, robustness certification for conformal prediction can be viewed as the generalization of certified prediction robustness, which justifies a certifiably robust prediction rather than a prediction set.Considering the challenges of providing tight bounds for certified prediction robustness, we expect that COLEP can motivate the certification of prediction robustness to benefit from a statistical perspective.\n\nLimitations.A possible limitation may lie in the computational costs induced by pretraining knowledge models.The problem can be partially relieved by training knowledge models with parallelism.Moreover, we only need to pretrain them once and then can encode different types of knowledge rules based on domain knolwedge.The training cost is worthy since we theoretically and empirically show that more knowledge models benefit the robustness of COLEP a lot for conformal prediction.Another possible limitation may lie in the access to knowledge rules.For the datasets that release hierarchical information (e.g., ImageNet, CIFAR-100, Visual Genome), we can easily adapt the information to implication rules used in COLEP.We can also seek knowledge graphs (Chen et al., 2020b) with related label semantics for rule design.These approaches may be effective in assisting practitioners in designing knowledge rules, but the process is not fully automatic, and human efforts are still needed.Overall, for any knowledge system, one naturally needs domain experts to design the knowledge rules specific to that application.There is probably no universal strategy on how to aggregate knowledge for any arbitrary application, and rather application-specific constructions are needed.This is where the power as well as limitation of our framework comes from.\n\nFuture work.The following directions are potentially interesting future work based on the framework of COLEP: 1) exploring different structures of knowledge representations and their effectiveness on conformal prediction performance, 2) proposing a more systematic way of designing logic rules based on domain knowledge, and 3) initiating a better understanding of the importance of different types of knowledge rules and motivating better design of rule weights accordingly.\n\nDiscussions.We will consider the cases where the knowledge graph is contaminated by adversarial attackers or contains noises and misinformation in this part.The robustness of COLEP mainly originates from the knowledge rules via factor function F (•) denoting how well each assignment conforms to the specified knowledge rules.Since the knowledge rules and weights are specified by practitioners and fixed during inferences, the PCs encoding the knowledge rules together with the main model and knowledge models (learning + reasoning component in Figure 1) can be viewed as a complete model.According to the adversarial attack settings in the literature Goodfellow et al. ( 2014); Gendler et al. ( 2022), the model weights can be well protected in practical cases and the attackers can only manipulate the inputs but not the model, and thus, the PC graph (i.e., the source of side information) which is a part of the augmented model can not be manipulated by adversarial attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, it is an interesting question to discuss the case when the knowledge rules may be contaminated and contain misinformation due to the neglect of designers.We can view the problem of checking knowledge rules and correcting misinformation as a pre-processing step before the employment of COLEP.The parallel module of knowledge checking and correction is well-explored by a line of research Melo & Paulheim (2017); Caminhas (2019); Chen et al. (2020a), which basically detects and corrects false logical relations in the semantic embedding space via consistency-checking techniques.It is also interesting to leverage more advanced large language models to check and correct human-designed knowledge rules.We deem that the process of knowledge-checking is independent and parallel to COLEP, which may take additional efforts before the deployment of COLEP but significantly benefits in achieving a much more robust system based on our analysis and evaluations.\n\nAlternative certification.There are two general certification directions for certifiably robust conformal prediction: (1) plugging in the standard score for for test example, and the quantile is computed on the worst-case scores for each calibration point as in our paper;\n\n(2) plugging in the worst-case score for the test example and the standard score for each calibration point.We can also adapt the results with the second line based on the symmetry between x and x ′ is indeed an interesting point.Specifically, given perturbed x ′ during test time, we can compute the bounds of output logits in the δ-ball, which will also cover the clean x.Since the logit bounds also hold for clean x, we can compute the worst-case scores based on the bounds and finally construct the prediction set with the clean quantile value.The two lines of certification are essentially parallel.It is fundamentally due to the exchangeability of clean samples, which leads to consideration of worst-case bounds either during calibration or inference.One practical advantage of the first line of certification might be that the computation of worst-case bounds requires more runtime, and thus, computing it during the offline calibration process might be more desirable than during the online inference process.\n\nDiscussions of selection of rule weights.If a knowledge rule is true with a lower probability, then the associated weight rule should be smaller, and vice versa.For example, there might be a case that a knowledge rule only holds with probability 70%.In the example, the probability is with respect to the data distribution, which means that 70% of data satisfies the rule \"IsStopSign→IsOctogan\".\n\nBesides, other factors such as the portions of class labels also affect the importance of corresponding rules.If one class label is pretty rare in the data distribution, then the knowledge rules associated with it clearly should be assigned a small weight, and vice versa.In summary, the importance of knowledge rules depends on the data distribution, no matter whether we select it via grid search or optimize it in a more subtle way.Therefore, we deem that a general guideline for an effective and efficient selection of rule weights is to perform a grid search on a held-out validation set, which is also essential for standard model training.However, we do not think the effectiveness of COLEP is quite sensitive to the selection of weights.From the theoretical analysis and evaluations, we can expect benefits from the knowledge rules as long as we have a positive weight w for the rules.\n\nB MORE RELATED WORK\n\nCertified Prediction Robustness To provide the worst-case robustness certification, a rich body of work has been proposed, including convex relaxations (Zhang et al., 2018;Li et al., 2019;Kang et al., 2023b), Lipschitz-bounded model layers (Tsuzuku et al., 2018;Singla et al., 2022;Xu et al., 2022b), and randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019;Salman et al., 2019;Li et al., 2021;2022a).However, existing work mainly focuses on certifying the prediction robustness rather than the prediction coverage, which is demonstrated to provide essential uncertainty quantification in conformal prediction (Jin et al., 2023).In this work, we aim to bridge worst-cast robustness certification and prediction coverage, and design learning frameworks to improve the uncertainty certification.\n\nKnowledged-Enabled Logical Reasoning Neural-symbolic methods (Ahmed et al., 2022;Garcez et al., 2022;Yi et al., 2018) use symbols to represent objects, encode relationships with logical rules, and perform logical inference on them.DeepProbLog (Manhaeve et al., 2018) and Semantic loss (Xu et al., 2018) are representatives that leverage logic circuits Brown ( 2003) with weighted mode counting (WMC) to integrate symbolic knowledge.Probabilistic circuits (PCs) (Darwiche, 2002;2003;Kisa et al., 2014) are another family of probabilistic models which allow exact and efficient inference.PCs permit various types of inference to be performed in linear time of the size of circuits (Hitzler & Sarker, 2022;Choi & Darwiche, 2017;Rooshenas & Lowd, 2014).\n\nWorst-case Certification.In particular, considering potential adversarial manipulations during test time, where a small perturbation could mislead the models to make incorrect predictions (Szegedy et al., 2014;Madry et al., 2018;Xiao et al., 2018;Cao et al., 2021), different robustness certification approaches have been explored to provide the worst-case prediction guarantees for neural networks.\n\nFor instance, a range of deterministic and statistical worst-case certifications have been proposed for a single model (Wong & Kolter, 2018;Zhang et al., 2018;Cohen et al., 2019;Lecuyer et al., 2019), reinforcement learning (Wu et al., 2022a;Kumar et al., 2022;Wu et al., 2022b), federated learning paradigms (Xie et al., 2021;2022), and fair learning (Kang et al., 2022;Ray Chaudhury et al., 2022), under constrained perturbations (Balunovic et al., 2019;Li et al., 2021;2022a).\n\nC PRELIMINARIES C.1 PROBABILISTIC CIRCUITS\n\nDefinition 1 (Probabilistic Circuit).A probabilistic circuit (PC) P defines a joint distribution over the set of random variables X and can be defined as a tuple (G, ψ), where G represents an acyclic directed graph (V, E), and ψ : V → 2 X the scope function that maps each node in V to a subset of X (i.e., scope).This scope function maps the nodes in the graph to specific subsets of random variables X.A leaf node Oleaf of G computes a probability density over its scope ψ(Oleaf).All internal nodes of G are either sum nodes (S) or product nodes (P ).A sum node S computes a convex combination of its children: S = N ∈ch(S) wS,N N where ch(S) denotes the children of node S. A product node P computes a product of its children:\n\nThe output of PC is typically the value of the root node O root .We mainly focus on the marginal probability computation inside PCs (e.g., P[\n\nThe inference of marginal probability is tractable by imposing structural constraints of smoothness and decomposability : (1) decomposability: for any product node P ∈ V, ψ(v1) ∩ ψ(v2) = ∅, for v1, v2 ∈ ch(P ), v1 ̸ = v2, and 2) smoothness: for any sum node S ∈ V, ψ(v1) = ψ(v2), for v1, v2 ∈ ch(S).With the constraint of decomposability, the integrals on the product node P can be factorized into integrals of children nodes ch(P ), which can be formulated as follows:\n\nWith the constraint of smoothness, the integrals on the sum node S can be decomposed linearly to integrals on the children nodes ch(S), which can be formulated as: We can see that the smoothness and decomposability of PCs enable the integral computation on parent nodes to be pushed down to that on children nodes, and thus, the integral x∈X,xj =1 O root (x) or x∈X O root (x) can be computed by a single forwarding pass of the graph G.In total, we only need two forwarding passes in the graph G to compute the marginal probability P[\n\nKnowledge rules in PCs.For the implication rule A =⇒ B, we define A as conditional variables and B as consequence variables.Suppose that the r-th PC encodes a set of implication rules defined over the set of Boolean variables V r .The PC is called a homogeneous logic PC if there exists a bipartition V rd and V rs (V rd ∪ V rs = V, V rd ∩ V rs = ∅) such that all variables in V rd only appear as conditional variables and all variables in V rs only appears as consequence variables.We construct homogeneous logic PCs to follow the structural properties of PCs (i.e., decomposability and smoothness) and can show that such construction is intuitive in real-world applications.For example, in the road sign recognition task, we construct a PC with the knowledge of shapes.We encode a set of implication rules A =⇒ B where A is the road sign, and B is the corresponding shape (e.g., a road sign can imply an octagon shape).We can verify that such a PC is a homogeneous PC and follow the structural constraints in the computation graph G, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nC.2 MULTIPLE PCS WITH COEFFICIENTS β r IN THE COMBINATION OF PCS\n\nLet us consider the case with R PCs.The conditional class probability of the j-th class corrected by r-th PC can be formulated as:\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n\nwhere µj denotes the j-th element of vector .Hr, K hr , w hr are the number of knowledge rules, the h-th logic rule, and the weight of the h-th logic rule for the r-th PC.Note that the numerator and denominator of eq. ( 24) can be exactly and efficiently computed with a single forwarding pass of PCs (Hitzler & Sarker, 2022;Choi & Darwiche, 2017;Rooshenas & Lowd, 2014).Specifically, the inference time complexity of one PC defined on graph (V, E) with node set V and edge set E is O(|V|).\n\nWe improve the expressiveness of the reasoning component by combining R PCs with coefficients βr for the r-th PC.Formally, given data input x, the corrected conditional class probability πCOLEP j can be expressed as:\n\nWe also note that the coefficients βr correspond to the accuracy of r-th PC normalized over all PC accuracies.The core of this formulation is the mixture model involving a latent variable r PC representing the PCs.In short, we can write π(r) j (x) as π(r) j (x) = P[Y = y|X = x, r PC = r], and πCOLEP j (x) as the marginalized probability over the latent variable r PC such as: With input perturbation ∥ϵ∥ 2 ≤ δ, the smoothed model satisfies:\n\nwhere Φ is the Gaussian cumulative density function (CDF) and Φ −1 is its inverse.\n\nIn practice, we can estimate the expectation in g j (x; σ) by taking the average over many i.i.d.realizations of Gaussian noises following (Cohen et al., 2019).Thus, the output probability of the smoothed model can be bounded given input perturbations.Note that the specific ways of certifying the learning component are orthogonal to certifying the reasoning component and the conformal prediction procedure, and one can plug in different certification strategies for the learning component.\n\nD CONFORMAL PREDICTION WITH COLEP\n\nD.1 FLEXIBILITY OF USER-DEFINED COVERAGE LEVEL\n\nIn this part, we illustrate the flexibility of COLEP to use different miscoverage levels α j for different label classes j ∈ [N c ] and prove the guaranteed coverage.Recall that in the standard conformal prediction setting, we are given a desired coverage 1 − α and construct the prediction set of a new test sample Ĉn,α (X n+1 ) with the guarantee of marginal coverage:\n\nIn COLEP, we construct the prediction set ĈCOLEPj n,αj (X n+1 ) for the j-th class (j ∈ [N c ]) as in Equation ( 7)\n\nand construct the final prediction set ĈCOLEP n,α (X n+1 ) as in Equation ( 8).Then we have the following:\n\nTherefore, we conclude that as long as we set max j∈[Nc] {α j } ≤ α, we have the guarantee of marginal coverage:\n\nThe flexibility of COLEP to set various coverage levels for different label classes is advantageous in addressing problems related to the imbalance of classes.For example, when samples of class j are extremely vulnerable to be attacked by the adversary, we can set a higher miscoverage level α j for class j to consider the class-specific vulnerability instead of setting a higher α for all classes which may affect the performance on other classes.\n\nD.2 ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE\n\nLet us consider the example of classifying whether the given image has a stop sign in Figure 1.The main model generates an estimate π(x), meaning that the image x has a stop sign with probability π(x).Suppose that we have a knowledge model to detect whether the image has an object of octagon shape with an estimate πo (x), meaning that the image x has an object of octagon shape with probability πo (x).Then we can encode the logic rule \"IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon\" with weight w in the PC, as shown in Figure 1.The PC defines a joint distribution over the Bernoulli random variables IsStopSign and IsStopSign and computes the likelihood of an instantiation of the random variables at its output (e.g., p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 0)).The represented joint distribution in the PC is determined by the encoded logic rule with the pattern in the top PC of Figure 1.We can see that only the assignment (IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 0) is not multiplied by the weight w due to the contradiction of the rule.Therefore, the probability of instantiations of random variables with such contradictions will be down-weighted after the correction of the PC.In the simple PC, we formally compute the class probability as: p(IsStopSign = 1) ={p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 0) + p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 1)}/ {p(IsStopSign = 1, p(IsOctagon = 0) + p(IsStopSign = 1, IsOctagon = 1) +p(IsStopSign = 0, IsOctagon = 0) + p(IsStopSign = 0, IsOctagon = 1)} .\n\n(33) Note that the nominator and denominator can be tractably computed by a forwarding pass of the PC graph.COLEP can enlarge the probability estimate p(IsStopSign = 1) when x is a stop sign and reduce it when x is not a stop sign by leveraging additional concept information p(IsStopSign, as rigorously analyzed in Lemma 5.1.\n\nE OVERVIEW OF CERTIFICATION\n\nWe provide the overview of certification flow in Figure 4, for a better understanding the connections

of COLEP.The certification setting is that the inference time adversaries can violate the data exchangeability assumption, compromising the guaranteed coverage.Therefore, the certification generally achieves the following three goals.( 1) We can preserve the guaranteed coverage using a prediction set that takes the perturbation bound into account (Thm.2), achieved by computing the probability bound of models before the reasoning component (by randomized smoothing) and the bound after the reasoning component (by Thm. 1).( 2) We prove the worst-case coverage (a lower bound) if we use the standard prediction set as before (Thm.3).( 3)\n\nWe theoretically show that COLEP can achieve a better prediction coverage (Thm.4) and prediction accuracy (Thm.5) than a data-driven model without the reasoning component.\n\nthe models with j ∀ ∈ [N c + L].Let V j rd be the set of index of conditional variables in the r-th PC except for j ∈ [N c ] and V j rs be that of consequence variables.Then the bound for COLEP-corrected estimate of the conditional class probability πCOLEP j is given by:\n\nProof of Thm. 1.We first provide a lemma that proves the monotonicity of the complex function with respect to the estimated condition probabilities of conditional variables and consequence variables within PCs as follows.\n\nLemma F.1 (Function Monotonicity within PCs).We define the target function as G(q, d) =\n\n).Then we have ∂G/∂ πq (x) ≤ 0 if class label q corresponds to a conditional variable in the PC and ∂G/∂ πq (x) ≥ 0 if class label q corresponds to a consequence variable in the PC.\n\nProof of Lemma F.1.Note that the function G(q, d) is linear with respect to πq (x).To explore the monotonicity, we only need to determine the sign of the coefficients of πq (x).We first consider the case where class label q corresponds to a conditional variable.We can rearrange the expression of G(q, d) as follows:\n\nThen we rearrange the coefficients of πq (x) as follows:\n\nwhere R(µ, q) : {0, 1} Nc+L × Z + → {0, 1} Nc+L rewrites the q-th dimension of vector µ to 1.Note that when q is the index of a conditional variable, given any implication logic rule K hr , we have\n\nSimilarly, when q is the index of a consequence variable, given any implication logic rule K hr , we have\n\nConsider the r-th PC.We first rearrange the formulation of the class conditional probability π(r) j (x) to the pattern of function G(•) and then leverage Lemma F.1 to derive the upper and lower bound.The reformulation of π(r) j (x) is shown as the following:\n\nNext, we focus on deriving the lower bound L[π (r) j (x)], and the upper bound can be derived similarly.\n\nIn Equation ( 41), we relax the numerator and denominator separately and then will show how to derive the upper bound of the numerator and the lower bound of the denominator in Equation ( 41).We can apply Lemma F.1 for any q ∈ [N c + L]\\{j} and get the following:\n\nwhere V j rd is the set of index of conditional variables in the r-th PC except for j ∈ [N c ] and V j rs is that of consequence variables.\n\nFrom Equation (41) and Equation ( 42), we can derive the final bound of πCOLEP j (x) by considering all the PCs:\n\nTheorem 2 (Recall).Consider a new test sample X n+1 drawn from P XY .For any bounded perturbation ∥ϵ∥ 2 ≤ δ in the input space and the adversarial sample Xn+1 := X n+1 + ϵ,

the proof of Thm. 2 in Appendix F.2.\n\nG FINITE-SAMPLE CERTIFIED COVERAGE\n\nIn this section, we consider the finite-sample error induced by the finite size of the calibration set I cal .\n\nWe provide the finite-sample certified coverage in the adversary setting as follows.\n\nCorollary 1 (Certified Coverage with Finite Samples).Consider the new sample X n+1 drawn from PXY and adversarial sample Xn+1 := X n+1 + ϵ with any perturbation ∥ϵ∥ 2 ≤ δ in the input space.\n\nWe have the following finite-sample certified coverage:\n\nwhere |I cal | is the size of the calibration set in conformal prediction.\n\nProof sketch and remarks.Leveraging corollary 1 of (Massart, 1990) and following the sketch in (Yang & Kuchibhotla, 2021), we can prove the finite-sample error bound.Combining the finitesample error with the certified coverage bound in Thm. 3 concludes the proof.Note that the union bound is applied to multiple models in (Yang & Kuchibhotla, 2021) while we circumvent it by aggregating individual results for class labels subtly, and thus, COLEP achieves an improved sample complexity of conformal prediction compared with ensemble learning given the same tolerance of finite-sample error.\n\nProof of Corollary 1. From Corollary 1 of (Massart, 1990), we have that for all ϵ > 0,\n\nFor ease of notation, we let:\n\nIt implies that:\n\nThen using Equation ( 93), we can bound E[W ] as follows:\n\nInequality (a) follows from Formula 7.1.13 of (Abramowitz & Stegun, 1948).Finally, combining the results in Thm. 3, we get:\n\nH OMITTED PROOFS IN SECTION 5\n\nH.1 PROOF OF LEMMA 5.1 Lemma 6.1 (Recall).For any class probability within models j ∈ [N c ] and data sample (X, Y ) drawn from the mixture distribution D m , we can prove that:\n\nwhere λ (r) j,D = (1/T (r) j,D + e −w − 1) and we shorthand πj (X) as πj .\n\nProof of Lemma 5.1.We first consider one PC and then analyze the effectiveness of R linearly combined PCs.Without loss of generality, we focus on the class conditional probability by the r-th\n\nRecall that we map a set of implication rules encoded in the r-th PC to an undirected graph G r = (V r , E r ), where V r = [N c + L] corresponds to the Boolean vector of class and concept predictions in the learning stage.There exists an edge between node j 1 ∈ V r and node j 2 ∈ V r iff they are connected by an implication rule j 1 =⇒ j 2 or j 2 =⇒ j 1 .Let A r (j ∀ ) be the set of nodes in the connected component of node j ∀ except for node j ∀ (i.e., j ∀ / ∈ A r (j ∀ )).Let A r,d (j ∀ ) ⊆ A r (j ∀ ) be the set of conditional variables and A r,s (j ∀ ) ⊆ A r (j ∀ ) be the set of consequence variables.Denote M j be the universal set of assignments except for the j-th element.Let P d (j) and P s (j) be the set of PC index where j appears as conditional variables and consequence variables, respectively.\n\nWe consider a mixture of benign and adversarial distributions denoted by D m , which indicates that an input x is either a benign example drawn from D b with probability p D b := P[x ∼ D b ] or an adversarial example drawn from D a with probability p Da := P[x ∼ D a ], where p D b + p Da = 1.We analyze the effectiveness of PCs in four cases: case (1) r ∈ P d (j) and Y ̸ = j, case (2) r ∈ P d (j) and Y = j, case (3) r ∈ P s (j) and Y = j, and case (4) r ∈ P s (j) and Y ̸ = j.We leave the probability conditions on Y = j or Y ̸ = j in each case for simplicity and consider them in the conclusions.\n\nCase (1) r ∈ P d (j) and Y ̸ = j.We can derive the class conditional probability by PCs as follows:\n\nNote that since r ∈ P s (j), we have µ∈M, µj =0 exp\n\n, and thus, π(r) j (x) ≤ πj (x) holds.Next, we analyze the gap to get a tight bound based on the distribution of the Boolean vector of the ground truth class and concepts ν.\n\nCase (1a): If ∃j ∀ ∈ A r,s (j), ν j ∀ = 0, then we have:\n\n≥ 1\n\nWhen we have models such that πj\n\nj,D ), we leverage the general bound in the case,\n\nWhen we have models of high quality such that πj\n\nj,D ), we can derive a tighter bound as follows:\n\nIn inequality (a), we plug in the lower bound of confidence of a correct prediction t j ∀ ,D and the upper bound of confidence of a wrong prediction 1 − t j ∀ ,D for label j ∀ .\n\nCombining Equations ( 109) and ( 113), we get the following bound for case (1a):\n\nwhere λ (r) j,D = (1/T (r) j,D + e −w − 1).Case (1b): If ∀j ∀ ∈ A r,s (j), ν j ∀ = 1, then we use the general bound in the case:\n\nNote that case (1a) is with probability U (r) j\n\nand case (1b) is with probability 1 − U (r) j .Combining Equation (114) in case (1a) and Equation (115) in case (1b), we have:\n\nCase (2): r ∈ P d (j) and Y = j.Since in the r-th PC j is the index of a conditional variable, we have ∀j ∀ ∈ A r,s (j), ν j ∀ = 1, where ν is the ground truth Boolean vector.Then we have the following:\n\nThen the following holds in case (2):\n\nCase (3): r ∈ P s (j) and Y = j.As in Case (1), we similarly consider cases based on the distribution of ground truth Boolean vector ν to get a tighter bound.\n\nCase (3a): ∃j ∀ ∈ A r,d (j), ν j ∀ = 1.\n\nWhen we have models such that πj\n\n) Equation ( 121) holds because in case (3), j corresponds to a consequence variable in the r-th PC, and thus, we always have:\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 When we have models of high quality such that πj ∀ (x) ≤ 1 − t j ∀ ,D |ν j ∀ = 0 and πj ∀ (x) ≥ 1 − t j ∀ ,D |ν j ∀ = 1 , ∀j ∀ ∈ A r (j) (with probability Z (r) j,D ), we can derive a tighter bound as follows:\n\nTherefore, the following holds in case (3a);\n\nCase (3b): If ∀j ∀ ∈ A r,d (j), ν j ∀ = 0, then we leverage the general bound:\n\nNote that case (3a) is with probability U (r) j and case (3b) is with probability 1 − U (r) j .Combining Equations ( 126) and ( 127), the following holds:\n\nCase (4): r ∈ P s (j) and Y ̸ = j.Since j is the index of a consequence variable, we have ∀j ∀ ∈ A r,d (j), ν j ∀ = 0.

cross-entropy loss for the knowledge models.\n\nKnowledge Rules & Reasoning.In summary, we have 3 PCs and 28 knowledge rules in GTSRB, 3 PCs and 30 knowledge rules in CIFAR-10, and 4 PCs and 187 knowledge rules in AwA2.Based on the domain knowledge in each dataset, we encode a set of implication rules into PCs.In each PC, we encode a type of implication knowledge with disjoint attributes.In GTSRB, we have a PC of shape knowledge (e.g.,\"octagon\", \"square\"), a PC of boundary color knowledge (e.g., \"red boundary\", \"black boundary\"), and a PC of content knowledge (e.g., \"digit 50\", \"Turn Left\").In CIFAR-10, we have a PC of category knowledge (e.g., \"animal\", \"transportation\"), a PC of space knowledge (e.g., \"in the sky\", \"in the water\", \"on the ground\"), and a PC of feature knowledge (e.g., \"has legs\", \"has wheels\").In AwA2, we have a PC of superclass knowledge (e.g., \"procyonid\", \"big cat\"), a PC of predation knowledge (e.g., \"fish\", \"meat\", \"plant\"), a PC of appearance (e.g., \"big ears\", \"small eyes\"), and a PC of fur color knowledge (e.g., \"green\", \"gray\", \"white\").\n\nFor example, in the PC of shape knowledge in GTSRB, we can encode the implication rules related to the shape knowledge such as IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon (stop signs are octagon) with weight w 1 , IsSpeedLimit =⇒ IsSquare (speed limit signs are square) with weight w 2 , and IsTurnLeft =⇒ IsRound (turn left signs are round) with weight w 3 .To implement the COLEP learning-reasoning framework, we follow the steps to encode the rules into PCs.(1) We learn the main model and knowledge models implemented with DNNs to estimate a preliminary probability for N c class labels and L concept labels (e.g., p(IsSpeedLimit = 1) = πsp , p(IsSquare = 1) = πsq ).( 2) We compute the factor value F (µ) for any possible assignment µ ∈ {0, 1} Nc+L as\n\nsince the assignment satisfy all three knowledge rules above).(3) We construct a three-layer PC as shown in Figure 1: (a) the bottom layer consists of leaf nodes representing Bernoulli distributions of all class and concept labels and the constant factor values of assignments (e.g., B(π sp ), B(1 − πsp ), B(π sq ), B(1 − πsq ), ..., F ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), F ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]), ...), (b) the second layer consists of product nodes computing the likelihood of each assignment by multiplying the likelihood of the instantiations of Bernoulli variables and the correction factor values (e.g., πsp × πsq × . . .× F ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])), and (c) the top layer is a sum node computing the summation of the products.(4) We linearly combine multiple PCs that encode different types of knowledge rules (e.g., 3 PCs in GTSRB: PCs of shape/color/content knowledge).We compute β k based on the utility of the k-th PC on the calibration set and manually set the weights of knowledge rules based on their utility.\n\nCodes are available at https://github.com/kangmintong/COLEP.Visualization of the contribution of different knowledge rules.In GTSRB, we consider the contribution of the shape knowledge rules, color knowledge rules, and content knowledge rules.In CIFAR-10, we consider the contribution of the category knowledge rules, space knowledge rules, and feature knowledge rules.More details of the meanings and examples of knowledge rules are provided in Appendix J.1.We provide the visualization of contributions of different types of knowledge rules in Figure 5.The results show that the rules related to the color knowledge in GTSRB and space knowledge in CIFAR-10 benefit the certified coverage more, but collectively applying all the well-designed knowledge rules leads to even better coverage.The effectiveness of these types of knowledge attributes to a higher utility of the knowledge models (i.e., the accuracy of concept detection).Concretely, the feature of these concepts is relatively easy to learn and can be more accurately detected (e.g., color concepts are more easily learned than shape concepts).The correlation between the knowledge model utility and effectiveness of COLEP is also theoretically analyzed and observed in Section 5. Runtime evaluation of COLEP.Since the knowledge models in the learning component are simple neural networks and can perform forward passes in parallelism, the additional computational complexity of COLEP comes mainly from the overhead of the reasoning component (i.e., PC).Given a PC defined on the directed graph (V, E), the time complexity of probabilistic inference is O(|V|), according to the details illustrated in Appendix C.1.Therefore, the additional time complexity of COLEP is O(|V|), linear to the number of nodes in PC graph.We empirically evaluate the runtime of a forward pass of COLEP and compare it with a standard model.The results in Table 1 show that COLEP only achieves a little higher runtime compared with a single standard model.Evaluations with different types of adversarial attacks.To evaluate the robustness of COLEP under various types of attacks, we further consider the AutoAttack method Croce & Hein (2020), which uses an ensemble of four diverse attacks to reliably evaluate the robustness: (1) APGD-CE attack, (2) APGD-DLR attack, (3) FAB attack, and (4) square attack.APGD-CE and APGD-DLR attacks are step size-free versions of PGD attacks with cross-entropy loss and DLR loss, respectively.FAB attack optimizes the adversarial sample by minimizing the norm of the adversarial perturbations.Square attack is a query-efficient black-box attack.We evaluate the prediction coverage and averaged set size of COLEP and SOTA method RSCP with ℓ 2 bounded perturbation of 0.25 on GTSRB, CIFAR-10, and AwA2.The desired coverage is 1 − α = 0.9 in the evaluation.The results in Table 2 show that under diverse and stronger adversarial attacks, COLEP still achieves higher marginal coverage than the nominal level 0.9 and also demonstrates a better prediction efficiency (i.e., smaller size of prediction sets) than RSCP.\n\nJ.2 ADDITIONAL EVALUATION OF COLEP\n\nEvaluations with various nominal levels.We further evaluate COLEP with multiple nominal levels of coverage 1 − α.We provide the results with multiple coverage levels 1 − α in Table 3.The results demonstrate that for different parameters of α, (1) COLEP always achieves a higher marginal coverage than the nominal level, indicating the validity of the certification in COLEP, and (2) COLEP shows a better trade-off between the prediction coverage and prediction efficiency (i.e., average set size) than the SOTA baseline RSCP.\n\nSelection of weights of knowledge rules.The weight w of logical rules is specified based on the utility of the corresponding knowledge rule.In Section 6, we theoretically show that the robustness of COLEP correlates with the utility of knowledge rules regarding the uniqueness of the rule, defined in Equation ( 17).Specifically, a universal knowledge rule which generally holds for almost all class labels is of low quality and does not benefit the robustness and should be assigned with a low weight w.For example, if all the traffic signs in the dataset are of octagon shape, then the implication rule IsStopSign =⇒ IsOctagon should be useless and assigned with a low weight w, which also aligns with the intuition.In the empirical evaluations, since we already designed knowledge rules of high quality (i.e., good uniqueness) as shown in Section 7, we do not need to spend great efforts selecting weights for each knowledge rule individually.We assume that all the knowledge rules have the same weight w and select a proper weight w for all the knowledge rules via grid searching.The results inspire us to fix w as 1.5, and the evaluations demonstrate that it is sufficient to achieve good robustness in different settings.One can also model the weight selection problem as a combinatorial optimization, which is non-trivial but can better unleash the power of COLEP.We leave a more intelligent and automatic approach of knowledge weight selection for future work.\n\nK OVERVIEW OF NOTATIONS\n\nIn this section, we provide overviews of used notations for a better understanding of the analysis of COLEP.Specifically, we provide an overview of notations related to models in Table 4, notations related to conformal prediction in Table 5, notations related to certification in Section 4 in Table 6, and notations related to analysis in Section 5 in Table 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We can upper bound the probability of miscoverage of the main task with the probability of miscoverage of label classes as follows:≤ max≤ max≤ maxwhere ĈCOLEP δ n,α,j ( Xn+1 ) := q y ∈ {0, 1} :is the certified prediction set for the class label j.Note that Equation (50) holds because we have S πCOLEP δ j (X n+1 ,). Next, we will prove Equation (50) rigorously.We first consider the probability of miscoverage conditioned on Y n+1 = j.Similarly, we consider the probability of miscoverage conditioned on Y n+1 ̸ = j.Combining Equation (55) and Equation (59), we prove that Equation (50) holds.Finally, from Equation (51), we prove that:if we construct the certified prediction set of COLEP whereand S πCOLEP δ j (•, •) is a function of worst-case non-conformity score considering perturbation radius δ:where] are computed by plugging in the β-confidence probability bound [π j ∀ (x; β), πj ∀ (x; β)] into Thm. 1.The high-confidence bound [π j ∀ (x; β), πj ∀ (x; β)] can be obtained by randomized smoothing as the following:where Ê is the empirical mean ofis the Berstein's finite-sample error.Proof of Thm. 6. Bounding the finite-sample error of randomized smoothing similarly as Theorem 1 in Anonymous (2023), we get that for a given j ∀ ∈ [N c + L], we have the following:We can upper bound the probability of miscoverage of the main task with the probability of miscoverage of label classes as follows:where ĈCOLEP δ n,α,j ( Xn+1 ) := q y ∈ {0, 1} :is the certified prediction set for the class label j.Note that Equation (70) holds because we have S πCOLEP δ j). Next, we will prove Equation (70) rigorously.We first consider the probability of miscoverage conditioned on Y n+1 = j.Similarly, we consider the probability of miscoverage conditioned on Y n+1 ̸ = j.Combining Equation (77) and Equation (82), we prove that Equation (70) holds.Finally, from Equation (72), we prove that:F.4 PROOF OF THM. 3Theorem 3 (Recall).Consider the new sample X n+1 drawn from PXY and adversarial sample Xn+1 := X n+1 + ϵ with any perturbation ∥ϵ∥ 2 ≤ δ in the input space.We have:where the certified coverage of the j-th class label τ COLEPcer j is formulated as:Proof of Thm. 3. We can bound the probability of coverage of the main task with the probability of coverage of label classes as follows:Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 H.3 PROOF OF THM. 5Theorem 5 (Recall).Suppose that we evaluate the expectation of prediction accuracy of πCOLEP j (•) and πj (•) on n samples drawn from D m and denote the prediction accuracy as A(π COLEP j (•), D m ) and A(π j (•), D m ).Then we have:Proof of Thm. 5. We can formulate the accuracy of πj (•) on D m as:Similarly, A(π COLEP j (•), D m ) can be formulated as:. Note that we have ϵ j,0,D > 0 and ϵ j,1,D > 0 by assumption.Then by rearranging the terms and Hoeffding's inequality, we can derive as follows:Similarly, we consider the case conditioned on Y = j.Note that from Equations (160) and (164), we have the following relation:Finally, by considering both the adversarial distribution and benign distribution, we can conclude that: .Assume that we aggregate PCs by taking the average (i.e., β r = 1/R).Then we have:Proof sketch.We construct a sequence {J r } R r=1 in a specific way and prove that it is a supermartingale or a sub-martingale with bounded differences conditioned based on the true label.Then we use Azuma's inequality to bound the objective A(π COLEP j , D m ) in different cases and combine them with union bound.Remarks.Lemma 5.1 indicates that better utility of knowledge models and implication rules can indicate a smaller E COLEP j,0and larger E COLEP j,1, which can further imply a tighter lower bound of prediction accuracy according toThm.7. Furthermore, according to the proof, we know that E COLEP j,0 negatively correlates with the number of PCs R and E COLEP j,1 has a positive correlation with R, indicating that more PCs (i.e., knowledge rules) implies a better prediction accuracy.Proof of Thm. 7. Consider R PCs.We construct a sequence {J r } R r=1 such that J r (X) = 1 r q∈ [r]  π(q) j (X), where π(q) j (•) is defined as Equation (24).We first consider the case conditioned on Y ̸ = j.Without loss of generality, assume that π(1)Then we can prove {J r } R r=1 is a super-martingale since we have the following:{J r } R r=1 also has bounded difference since we have the following:Also note that we have:Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 Therefore, {J ′ r } R r=1 is conditionally independent.Then by using Azuma's inequality, we can derive as follows:Finally, the following holds.Note that we can formulate A(π COLEP j , D m ) as:Combining Equations (182) and (195), we have: Implementation details.We run evaluations using three different random seeds and report the averaged results.We omit the standard deviation of the results since we observe they are of low variance due to a large sample size used for calibration and testing.All the evaluation is done on a single A6000 GPU.In the evaluation of certified coverage, we compute the smoothed score or prediction probability 100, 000 times for randomized smoothing and fix the ratio of perturbation bound and the smoothing factor during certification δ/σ cer as 0.5 for both RSCP and COLEP.In the evaluation of marginal coverage and set size under PGD attack, we use the attack objective of   undirected graph encoded with rules in the r-th PC A r (j ∀ ) node set in connected components of node j ∀ in graph G r A r,d (j ∀ ) node set of conditional variables in connected components of node j ∀ in graph G r A r,s (j ∀ ) node set of consequence variables in connected components of node j ∀ in graph G r ν(x) boolean vector of ground truth class and concepts given sample x as input t j∀,D the threshold of confidence for the j ∀ -th label z j∀,D probability matching this threshold for the j ∀ -th label T the set of PC index where j appears as conditional variables and consequence variables U (r) j utility of associated knowledge rules within the r-th PC for the j-th class ϵ j,0 ,ϵ j,1 characterization of probability correction by COLEP conditioned on ground truth label 0 and 1 ϵ j,0,D ϵ j,0,D = E (X,Y )∼D [ϵ j,0 |ν j = 0], expectation of ϵ j,0 ϵ j,1,D ϵ j,1,D = E (X,Y )∼D [ϵ j,1 |ν j = 1], expectation of ϵ j,1 A(π, D) accuracy of probability estimator π on data distribution D\nHandbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables.

    "text": "\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last decade CO 2 laser ablation has become a mature technique for the processing of optical glasses, uniquely suited to fabricating micrometer-scale structures with sub-nanometer surface roughness [1,2]. A wide range of shapes can be produced using this technique, including microspheres [3], microlenses [4,5], microtoroids [6], gratings [1], holographic structures [7] and concave mirror templates [8,9]. In particular, such concave mirror templates can be realized on the tip of optical fibers [8], and can be used to define tunable open-access Fabry-Perot microcavities with high finesse [10,11]. The combination of spectral tunability, high finesse, intrinsic fiber coupling and uniquely small dimensions offered by these optical cavities has led to their widespread adoption in the cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) community [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19], and to a lesser extent in the optomechanics community [20][21][22][23]. \n\nOver the past few years, the main focus of research on CO 2 laser ablation of mirror templates on optical fibers has been developing multi-shot ablation procedures in order to achieve better control over the geometry of the concave shape [24][25][26][27]. These studies, alongside with improved analytical and numerical cavity models [28][29][30][31][32], notably contributed to recent breakthroughs in trapped ion CQED [33], trapped atom CQED [34], solid-state QED [35], and optomechanics [36]. Nevertheless, a systematic study of the effects of fabrication parameters on the geometrical characteristics of structures created by a single ablation pulse has not yet been reported. \n\nIn this work we focus on single-shot ablation, adding to the pioneering work from [8]. We realize mirror templates on the tips of a large number of optical fibers using varying pulse powers (0.5 to 3 W), pulse durations (10 to 30 ms), and spot sizes (32 to 67 µm). We characterize in detail the influence of each of those three ablation parameters on the shape of the resulting structures, and more specifically on their radius of curvature, depth, and diameter. We then study the relationships between those three geometrical characteristics and identify regimes of ablation parameters that lead to templates with favorable geometries for use in CQED and optomechanics. \n\nSetup and methods\n\nCO 2 ablation setup\n\nOur CO 2 laser ablation setup is depicted in Fig. 1(a). Similarly to the setup introduced in [25], it comprises both a CO 2 ablation arm and an imaging arm. The fiber holder is translated between the two arms using a Thorlabs DDS220 long-travel x stage, and is further positioned using PI M-111.12S short-travel y-z stages. The fiber is held in a Thorlabs HFV002 V-groove fiber holder. A Synrad Firestar V30 CO 2 laser is driven by a 20 kHz pulse-width-modulated control signal which ensures a continuous output and determines the maximum power that can be used for ablation. Here we use a 50 % duty cycle, which corresponds to a maximum power of 2.1 W. The laser beam is sent through a Brimrose GEM-40 acousto-optic modulator (AOM) whose RF drive is amplitude-modulated by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) which is synchronized to the CO 2 laser drive signal. We use square pulses of amplitude V AOM between 0 and 1 V and of duration τ ranging from 10 to 50 ms. Given that the 125 ns rise time of the AOM is short compared to the duration of the pulses, the temporal profile imprinted on the CO 2 laser beam is approximately square. The first-order diffracted beam goes through a Faraday isolator and a quarter-waveplate, ensuring the beam is circularly polarized. The laser beam is then expanded in a Kepler telescope so that it fills the focusing lens. A 50 µm diameter pinhole positioned at the focal point of the beam expander provides spatial filtering. The beam is finally focused on the target with a 50 mm focal length aspheric lens. The radius of the beam at the position of the target is controlled by positioning the target at a distance ∆z from the focal point of the lens, ranging from 0 to −1 mm. The mapping between the defocusing distance ∆z and the 1/e 2 beam radius (spot size) w was calibrated by performing a series of knife-edge measurements of the beam profile for different values of ∆z. Additionally, a mirror can be placed between the beam expander and the focusing lens in order to measure the incident power with a power meter. This provides a mapping between the amplitude V AOM of the pulse sent to the AOM and the peak power P CO2 of the ablation pulse. \n\nThe imaging arm consists of an infinity-corrected microscope objective, a green LED and a CMOS camera. The green light from the LED is collimated and directed to the objective with a beamsplitter. The light reflected from the target is then focused on the camera sensor by a tube lens. \n\nExperimental procedure\n\nWe use bare Thorlabs 780HP single mode fiber, which has a cladding diameter of 125 µm and a core diameter of 8 µm. Each fiber is prepared, ablated, and finally characterized. \n\nThe fiber preparation steps include cutting to length, stripping, cleaving, and positioning into the holder. We use a Photon Kinetics PK11 ultrasonic cleaver to obtain smooth cleaves with minimal cleave angles. The fiber is clamped onto the V-groove holder with about 2 mm of freestanding length. \n\nBefore ablation, the core of the fiber is centered in front of the imaging arm. The holder is then translated by a carefully calibrated distance in all three directions so that the core of the fiber is located at the focal point of the laser beam. An additional displacement ∆z (defocusing distance) along the beam axis can be performed at this point in order to change the spot size of the CO 2 beam at the position of the fiber. We then signal the AWG to send an electrical pulse of amplitude V AOM and duration τ to the AOM at the next raising edge of the CO 2 laser control signal. After ablation, the target is translated back to its original position for imaging. In-situ microscopy (Fig. 1(b) and (d)) is used to confirm centering and to roughly estimate the geometrical characteristics of the concave structure. The fiber is finally transferred to a different holder for profiling and storage. \n\nFor characterization, each fiber is profiled with a Keyence VK-X200K laser scanning confocal microscope. The two examples of such profiles plotted in Fig. 1(c) and (e) show two typical geometries that we obtain depending on the ablation pulse power, as discussed in the next section. We additionally performed AFM measurements on a few of the fibers and found that the roughness at the center of the ablated structures is typically smaller than 0.3 nm rms, in good agreement with previously reported values [8]. The green dashed curve is the corresponding linecut through the best fit elliptic paraboloid. The dotted black curve is the circle of radius ROC a (defined in the main text), which appears as an ellipse due to the scale used. The annotations illustrate the geometrical characteristics that are calculated during the fitting procedure. \n\nFitting procedure\n\nWhen the height profiles exhibit a concave structure, we run them through a Python fitting routine that extracts the characteristic dimensions of the concave part. The fitting process is illustrated in Fig. 2, in which the graphical output of the routine is displayed. The Python script first corrects for plane tilt, finds the center of the structure, and calculates its outer diameter D out which we define as the diameter of the contour line at 5 % of the depth of the structure. An elliptic paraboloid is then fitted to the height profile cropped to a disk centered on the structure and whose radius is half the waist of a Gaussian fitted to a linecut through the structure. The fit results are then used to calculate the depth t of the structure and its radii of curvature ROC a and ROC b along the major and minor axes of the elliptic paraboloid. We additionally define the mean radius of curvature ROC = (ROC a + ROC b )/2, and the asymmetry γ = (ROC a − ROC b )/ROC a . The routine finally computes the residuals of the fit and calculates the spherical diameter D sph of the structure, which we define as the diameter of the disk centered on the structure for which fit residuals are smaller than 100 nm. D sph is intended to be an estimate of the effective mirror diameter as used in [10]. \n\nEffects of ablation parameters on the shape of the structure\n\nCO 2 laser ablation is a complex, multi-physical process in which the dynamics of heat transfer, phase transitions and liquid flow all come into play. The dominant phenomena for determining the shape created at the ablation site are strongly material dependent and change for even small variations in ablation parameters [37]. For instance, when the surface temperature is not raised above the vaporization temperature, material removal is minimal and the ablation site mainly undergoes smoothing [38]. When vaporization occurs, for certain ablation parameters a combination of vaporization and of melt displacement driven by recoil pressure can result in the formation of a concave shape [39]. Finally, if solidification occurs slowly enough, capillary forces can make the geometry evolve further, eventually leading to a convex shape [40]. Mainly due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the ablation process and to the lack of data on material properties at high temperature, both analytical and numerical models have yet to demonstrate the ability to accurately predict the shape resulting from CO 2 laser ablation within an experimentally relevant range of ablation parameters [37,[40][41][42]. Modeling is especially problematic in the case when optical fibers are used as the target because lateral boundary effects come into play [8] . As a result, the extensive experimental exploration of the fabrication parameter space presented here is relevant both from a fundamental point of view and to determine ablation parameters useful to create shapes designed for specific applications. Extending on the work in [8], we aim at improving the understanding of the effect of each ablation parameter, extending the range of geometries that can be achieved and providing guidelines for the fabrication of structures for open micro-cavities. \n\nWe study the geometrical characteristics of 129 structures machined on Thorlabs 780HP single mode fibers following the single-shot CO 2 ablation procedure described above. We used pulse durations τ of 10, 30, and 50 ms and defocusing distances ∆z of 0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, and −0.4 mm, corresponding to spot sizes w of 32, 36, 45, 56, and 67 µm. For each combination of those parameters we performed a series of ablations with varying pulse power P CO2 . We then measured the height profile of the fiber facets, which can be flat, concave, convex or a mixture of convex and concave. We focus on the 123 fibers that are concave in their centers and fit this concave part to extract the geometrical characteristics of the structure. \n\nIn order to illustrate the effect of ablation pulse power on the shape, linecuts through the height profiles of a selection of fibers are plotted in Fig. 3. We distinguish 5 different regimes of pulse power, each of them leading to a different type of modification of the surface of the fiber, some of which might not be observed depending on the value of the other ablation parameters. 1) For very low pulse powers, no modification of the surface occurs. 2) For low pulse powers, the overall geometry is not modified, but the area exposed to the laser is smoothed due to melting and resolidification. 3) For medium pulse powers, concave structures are created, whose depth and outer diameter increase with pulse power. 4) For high pulse powers, concave structures whose depth and outer diameter decrease with pulse power are created within an increasingly convex shape. This compound shape is an interesting geometry for short cavities [43]. 5) For very high pulse power, a fully convex shape is created. We are mainly interested in regimes 3 and Fig. 3. Linecuts taken through the height profiles of fibers ablated with increasing ablation pulse power and duration, as measured by laser scanning confocal microscopy. The axis shows the direction along which P CO2 increases and illustrates the power regimes defined in the main text. A spot size of 45 µm was used for all fibers. A pulse duration of 30 ms was used for all fibers but the rightmost, which was subjected to a 300 ms ablation pulse. 4, in which a concave structure is created. These two regimes must be considered separately for further discussion of the effects of pulse power, pulse duration, and spot size on the geometry of the structure. The geometrical characteristics ROC, t, D out , and D sph obtained by fitting the profiles of the fibers exhibiting concave structures, are plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of the ablation parameters P CO2 , τ, and w. In the low power regime (regime 3), an increase in pulse power leads to a decrease in ROC, and an increase in depth, outer diameter and spherical diameter. In the high power regime (regime 4), an increase in pulse power leads to an increase in ROC, a decrease in depth and outer diameter, and an increase in spherical diameter. In both power regimes, an increase in spot size leads to an increase in ROC, a decrease in depth and has no significant effect on the outer and spherical diameter. Increasing the pulse duration has a more complex effect: it generally shifts values of the geometrical characteristics to lower pulse powers and narrows their distribution. This results in a decrease in the pulse power corresponding to the onset of regime 4, associated to an increase in the sensitivity of the geometrical characteristics to changes in the pulse power. As a consequence, shorter pulse durations give a finer control over the geometry of the structures since deviations in pulse power have a smaller effect. In addition, decreasing the pulse duration decreases the minimum achievable ROC, increases the maximum achievable depth, and decreases the minimum achievable outer and spherical diameter. Note that we do not observe the defocusing distance to have a significant effect on crater asymmetry, which we measure to be 5 % on average. \n\nRelationships between the geometrical characteristics of concave structures\n\nFiber-based Fabry-Perot optical microcavities are widely used in the fields of CQED [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]33,34] and optomechanics [20][21][22][23], with additional applications in sensing [44][45][46]. A figure of merit common to most of these applications is the ratio between the finesse F of the cavity and the crosssection πw 2 0 of the fundamental mode of the cavity, which we define here as FOM = F /(πw 2 0 ). In order to maximize finesse and minimize the waist w 0 , it is necessary to optimize several geometrical characteristics simultaneously, while complying with experimental requirements specific to each application. However, strong relationships exist between the different geometrical characteristics of concave structures created by CO 2 ablation, which have been reported to put most of the parameter space out of reach [47,48], leading to significant compromises. In this section we study the relationships between the geometrical characteristics of the concave structures, showing that they can be independently chosen to a larger extent by varying τ, ∆z, and P CO2 . We then point towards strategies to fabricate mirror templates tailored for two commonly used cavity geometries and their associated applications. \n\nThe relationship between the radius of curvature and the depth of the structures is shown in Fig. 5(a,b). It is most relevant to fiber-based cavity QED with solid-state emitters, or to other applications where an optical emitter is located on or near one of the mirrors. The optimal cavity geometry is the planar-concave geometry, for which the waist of the fundamental mode is given by: \n\nwhere ROC is the radius of curvature of the concave mirror and L cav is the cavity length. FOM is usually improved by minimizing both the cavity length and the radius of curvature in order to decrease the mode waist, the physical limit for L cav being the depth of the structure. One should additionally make sure that L cav < ROC/2 in order to prevent finesse deterioration due to clipping losses [29]. A guideline for the best cavity geometry is then L cav = t = ROC/2 (shown as a gray dashed line in Fig. 5(a,b)), with ROC and t as small as possible. The ablation results plotted in Fig. 5(a,b) show a strong nonlinear relationship between the radius of curvature and the depth of structures ablated with varying pulse power at constant spot size and pulse duration. However we observe that this relationship depends strongly on the value of the spot size and pulse duration. Structures with favorable geometries can be produced using short pulse durations and small spot sizes, the latter of which can be obtained by using a focusing lens with a larger numerical aperture and by performing the ablation at its focal point. In contrast, another category of applications exists for which experimental constraints limit how short the cavity can be made. Fiber-based cavity QED with trapped atoms or ions, fiber-based cavity optomechanics, or other applications where the emitter or mechanical resonator is located in between the two mirrors belong to this category. The preferred cavity geometry is then the symmetric geometry, and for these relatively long cavity lengths the main obstacle to maximizing FOM is maintaining a high finesse. Finesse is degraded by clipping losses, which arise when the spot size of the fundamental mode of the cavity on the end mirrors becomes large compared to the spherical diameter. The condition on D sph for clipping losses not to significantly degrade the finesse of a symmetric cavity is given by [10]: \n\nIn order to minimize waist while maintaining a high finesse, one should choose structures with the smallest radii possible which satisfy both Eq. ( 2) and ROC > L cav . The relationship between the spherical diameter and the radius of curvature of the structures is shown in Fig. 5(c,d), where the region defined by Eq. ( 2) is shown for L cav = ROC. Craters fabricated with a high pulse power within regime 4 exhibit the largest spherical diameters, while pulse duration or spot size can be changed to adjust the radius of curvature. \n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, we have performed a systematic study of the effect of single-shot CO 2 laser ablation parameters on fiber tip geometry. We have investigated the effects of extended ranges of pulse power, pulse duration, and spot size and developed guidelines for the fabrication of fiber mirror templates optimized for experiments in optomechanics and CQED. We anticipate that this study will be helpful in providing empirical insight in the physics of laser ablation processes. Notably, we have observed a new parameter regime in which ROC, D sph , and D out exhibit extrema as a function of P CO2 and τ (see Fig. 4). We speculate that the presence of such extrema arises from the interplay of surface tension and boundary effects originating from the limited lateral size of the fibers. Associated with this we find that compound concave-convex shapes can be produced using a simple single-shot ablation procedure (ablation regime 4 in Fig. 3). Such compound shapes are very useful for small mode volume cavities and previously required tapering of the fiber in an additional processing step [43]. Finally, we expect that using shorter laser pulses and smaller spot sizes than presented here will enable to simultaneously decrease ROC and crater depth further. \n\nFunding\n\nWe acknowledge the support of the ERC through Starting Grant NWScan (Grant No. 334767), the Swiss National Science Foundation (Ambizione Grant No. PZ00P2-161284/1) and the NCCR Quantum Science and Technology (QSIT). \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n         \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n      \n",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe compressible state of two dimensional electrons at the filling factor ν = 1/2 has been explained as the result of Fermi surface formation of quasiparticles called composite fermions [1,2]. Here the filling factor, ν, is the ratio of the number of electrons and the total number of external flux quanta given by the external magnetic field. Thus there exist φ number of external flux quanta per electron if ν = 1/ φ. The composite fermions are bound objects of electrons and their correlation holes. Due to the fact that the electron wavefunction vanishes at the positions of correlation holes and there exists a phase winding of the electron wavefunction around them, these correlation holes are also called vortices. The bound state of electrons and even number of vortices satisfies Fermi statistics leading to the name \"composite fermions\" [3]. \n\nUpon the discovery of the compressible states in the half-filled Landau level, it was soon proposed that the vortices can be represented by fictitious flux quanta pointing in the opposite direction of the external magnetic field [4]. In this case, the bound state of an electron and two fictitious flux quanta would see zero effective magnetic field on average at ν = 1/2 [4,5]. This is because the number of external flux quanta per electron and that of fictitious flux quanta are the same. Now the composite fermion system can form a Fermi sea as if they are free fermions in zero magnetic field. These ideas can be formulated in terms of the Chern-Simons gauge theory that represents the fictitious flux quanta by a U(1) gauge field and requires the position of these flux quanta to be the same as those of electrons. This \"Chern-Simons composite fermion\" theory explained the finite compressibility of the system and various experimental results that require understanding of the long wavelength and low energy properties of the system [4]. \n\nIn spite of this success, the Chern-Simons composite fermion theory suffers from some important problems. At the most naive level, the flux attachment transformation uses the kinetic energy of the electrons to generate the kinetic energy of composite fermions. If this transformation is taken seriously, the mass of the composite fermions is given by the bare mass of electrons. This is certainly not correct because, in the lowest Landau level, the kinetic energy of electrons is quenched and the only relevant energy scale is given by the interaction energy; the mass of the composite fermions should be determined by the interaction energy scale [1,4]. Therefore the kinetic energy term with the bare mass in the Hamiltonian should be somehow replaced by the term with the interaction induced mass [1,4]. In the Chern-Simons theory approach, the kinetic energy term with the interaction induced mass has been used on phenomenological ground [1,4]. One hopes that the final answer will be correct in the limit of the zero bare mass (infinite cyclotron energy). Sometime ago, more microscopic picture was suggested to resolve the unsatisfactory aspects of the Chern-Simons theory [6]. In the lowest Landau level, the system of N number of composite fermions maintains the antisymmetry of the total wavefunction by assigning a different vector k j (j = 1, ..., N ) to each composite fermion such that the distance between the electron and vortices in a given composite fermion j is |k j |l 2 B and the direction of k j is perpendicular to the line connecting the positions of electron and vortices [6]. Here l B = hc/eB is the magnetic length. The electron and vortices within each composite fermion drift along the equipotential, V (|k|), in the same direction keeping the distance, |k|l 2 B , between them. This can generate the dispersion (or \"kinetic energy\") of the composite fermions [6]. Also the vectors k j form a Fermi sea in k-space with a well defined Fermi wavevector k F = √ 4πn e where n e is the density of electrons. Since the \"kinetic energy\" arises from the interaction potential, the effective mass at the Fermi wavevector is determined by the interaction energy scale [6]. These composite fermions are called \"dipolar composite fermions\" due to the dipolar internal structure [6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. The ideas outlined above have been recently formulated in several different ways [7][8][9][10][11][12]. The essential parts of the formulation can be summarized as follows [7][8][9][10][11][12]. We consider the case of ν = 1/ φ for simplicity. Let R ej be the position of the electron j and R vj be the position of φ number of vortices associated with the electron j. Equivalently one can regard the complex coordinates of vortices, w j , as dummy variables in reference to the coordinates, z j = x j + iy j , of the electrons. Using a canonical transformation, we can define an equivalent set of coordinates: \n\nwhere (∧a) µ ≡ ǫ µν a ν (µ, ν = x, y) and a∧b = a•(∧b). In this representation, r j is the center of mass coordinate, |k j |l 2 B is the distance between the electron and vortices, and the direction of k j is perpendicular to the line connecting the electron and the vortices. Notice that R ej and R vj are guiding center coordinates of electrons and vortices so that they satisfy the following commutation relations. \n\nwhere R x ej and R y ej denote the x and y components of R ej and so on. Using these relations, we get \n\nwhere α, β = x, y. Thus k j serves as the canonical momentum of the coordinate r j . The density operators for electrons and vortices can be written in the Fourier space as \n\nwhere L and R represent the electron and vortices respectively. In order to eliminate additional degrees of freedom (the coordinates of the vortices are dummy variables) and ensure the equivalence to the original system, we require the following constraint. \n\nwhere ρ is the average density of electrons. The Hamiltonian of the system is written in terms of physical electron density operators [7,9,11]: \n\nwhere Ṽ (q) = V (q)e −q 2 l 2 B /2 and V (q) is the interaction potential. The colons : ... : represents the normal ordering. \n\nIn the long wavelength limit, the electron density operator can be expanded as \n\n2 j e iq•rj q ∧ k j . \n\n(1.7) \n\nThe Hamiltonian can now be written as (up to a constant) \n\n(1.8) \n\nIn particular, the i = j term will give rise to \n\nThis may be taken as the origin of the kinetic energy term of the composite fermions in the long wavelength limit [7][8][9][10][11][12]. \n\nIt turns out that it is very important to incorporate the residual interaction terms and the constraint to satisfy proper conservation laws. For example, the original system of dipolar composite fermions is invariant under k j → k j + K for all j and any K because it just corresponds to a constant shift in the center of mass coordinate of the entire system [9][10][11]. This symmetry is intimately related to the fact that the kinetic energy term of the electrons is absent or the system is in the infinite bare mass limit m b → ∞. This, for example, leads to F 1 = −1 among Landau parameters via m * /m b = 1 + F 1 if the dipolar composite fermions are treated as quasiparticles in the Landau Fermi liquid theory [10,11]. The approximate Hamiltonian in Eq.1.9, however, breaks this symmetry. While this problem can be fixed in the long wavelength and low energy limits by incorporating the constraints [10], it was also shown that one can formulate the theory in a conserving approximation for all q and ω (more specifically for ν = 1 bosons) [11]. In any case, the conserving approximation leads to the conclusion that the system is still compressible [10,11]. Also various physical response functions in the low energy and long wavelength limit were shown to have the same forms as those of the Chern-Simons gauge theory approach. In other words, the dipolar composite fermion description in the infinite bare mass limit seems to be equivalent to the Chern-Simons composite fermion system in the zero bare mass (or infinite cyclotron energy) limit as far as the low energy and long wavelength limits are concerned [10,11]. \n\nIn this paper, we ask whether the close correspondence between the results of the Chern-Simons theory and those of the lowest Landau level theory is still valid at finite wavevectors where the excitations do not necessarily look like dipolar quasiparticles. We were partly motivated by the recent phonon drag experiment in the double-layer ν = 1/2 system [13]. In this experiment, the drag resistivity between two layers due to the electron-phonon interaction is measured [13]. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, it has been known that the phonon drag divided by T 2 reaches its maximum when the temperature becomes of the order of T 0 = c(2k e F ) where c is the phonon velocity and k e F is the Fermi wavevector of the electrons in each layer [14,15]. This is due to the fact that the particle-hole excitations of electrons cease to exist beyond the wavevector q = 2k e F so that the phonons with q > 2k e F cannot scatter electrons at low temperatures. Thus the scattering between the particle-hole continuum and the phonons is suppressed when the energy scale is larger than T 0 . In a way, this experiment can tell us the properties of the system at short distances like (k e F ) −1 . In the case of ν = 1/2 double-layer system, one may expect that the cutoff wavevector scale would be set by the composite fermion Fermi wavevector, \n\nF if all the spins of electrons are polarized due to strong magnetic field. It is expected that the maximum of the drag resistivity should occur at a temperature T max 1/2 around T 1/2 = c(2k cf F ) = √ 2T 0 . On the other hand, in the experiment, T max 1/2 turns out to be even smaller than T 0 [13]. Recently, Bonsager, MacDonald, and the author performed a theoretical calculation of the drag resistivity in the Chern-Simons theory [16]. It was found that the maximum of the drag resistivity indeed occurs around T 1/2 if the effective Fermi energy (determined from the effective mass) of the composite fermions ε F is much larger than T 1/2 [16]. However, for realistic values of effective mass, one finds ε F ∼ T 1/2 leading to substantial finite temperature effects that were not observed in the experiment [16]. At this stage, it appears that the Chern-Simons theory does not capture the correct short distance properties of the system. \n\nUpon this situation, it is natural to ask what happens to the composite fermions in the lowest-Landaulevel theory at short distances because this approach is supposed to be more microscopic. One may expect that more microscopic theory may give rise to different results compared to the predictions of the Chern-Simons theory and eventually explain the experiment. In this paper, we will consider the density-density response function at q = 2k F at low energies and investigate possible difference between the results of the lowest Landau level theory and the Chern-Simons theory. In order to compare the theory with the drag experiment, we need to know the physical response functions at arbitrary energy and wavevector scales. Thus complete explanation of the experiment mentioned above is beyond the scope of this paper. We will, however, try to make a connection wherever it is possible and discuss what might happen in the drag experiment using our results. \n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we briefly review the formalism of the lowest-Landaulevel theory. In section III, the density-density response function at q = 2k F in the low energy limit is evaluated. In section IV, these results are compared with those of the Chern-Simons theory. In section V, we discuss possible connection between our results and the phonon drag experiment. We summarize our results in section VI. \n\nII. BRIEF REVIEW OF THE LOWEST-LANDAU-LEVEL THEORY\n\nWe set l B = 1 from now on. We restore this factor explicitly wherever it is necessary. It can be shown that the density operators of electrons and vortices in Eq.1.4 can be written in second quantized forms as [11] ρ \n\nwhere c k , c † k satisfy the fermionic anticommutation relation; \n\nThese operators satisfy the following lowest-Landau-level algebra first noticed in Ref. [17]. \n\nThe constraint in Eq.1.5 implies that \n\nOne can first build up states as combinations of {ki} c † k |0 where i = 1, ..., N and then project them to satisfy the constraint. Notice also that the constraint operators G(q) = ρ R (q)− ρ(2π) 2 δ(q) commutes with the Hamiltonian given by Eq.1.6. \n\nUsing the second quantized electron density operator, the Hamiltonian in Eq.1.6 can be rewritten as [11] H = 1 2 \n\nsubject to the constraints ρ R (q) − ρ(2π) 2 δ(q) = 0. We first use the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation to obtain the effective kinetic energy of the quasiparticles. In the HF approximation, the effective single-particle Hamiltonian can be written as [7,9,11,12] \n\nwhere ξ k = ε k − µ and \n\nIn the ground state at zero temperature, \n\ntimes the Fermi wavevector of the electrons in zero magnetic field and µ chosen such that ξ kF = 0. Notice that k dependence of ξ k comes from the Fock term in the effective Hamiltonian. When the interaction potential is repulsive, ξ k is a monotonically increasing function of |k|. The effective mass of the quasiparticles at the Fermi level can be obtained from [11] \n\nwhere θ kk ′ is the angle between k and k ′ . The HF ground state which is just the Fermi sea |F S is not annihilated by the constraint operator; G(q)|F S = 0 for q = 0. Also G(q) does not commute with the HF effective Hamiltonian. Thus G(q) are not conserved by the HF approximation. In order to recover the conserved quantities, we use the generalized HF theory called the time-dependent HF approximation which is the natural conserving approximation related to the HF theory. \n\nThe density-density response function in this generalized HF approximation corresponds to the sum of all ring and ladder diagrams with the single particle Green's function given by \n\nwhere ω n is the Matsubara frequency. The irreducible density-density response function of electrons, χ irr LL , in the generalized HF approximation corresponds to the sum of the ladder diagrams. The expression for χ irr LL was found to have the following form [11]. \n\nHere the scattering vertex function, Γ(k, k ′ , q, iω ν ), satisfies the following integral equation. \n\nIt is also useful to define the following one-particle-irreducible vertex function; \n\n(2.12) \n\nOne can show that the conservation of the constraints is represented by the following Ward identities satisfied by Λ(k, q, iω ν ) [11]; \n\n(2.13) For example, using the Ward identity, one can show that ρ R (q)ρ R (−q) = ρ R (q)ρ L (−q) = 0 and so on [11]. At low temperatures, in the limit of small q and ω ν , the expression for Γ(k, k ′ , q, iω ν ) was explicitly found as [11] \n\nwhere \n\nand \n\n(2.17) \n\nHere v k is the velocity and N (0) the density of states at the Fermi level. In the long wavelength limit, the exponential factors in the expression of χ irr LL can be expanded as e ik∧q − 1 ≈ ik ∧ q. Using the scattering vertex function in the long wavelength and low energy limits, one finds [10,11] \n\n. \n\n(2.18) \n\nIt leads to the similar result to that of the density-density response function in the Chern-Simons theory in the long wavelength and low energy limits (small |q| and ω) [11]; \n\nwhere χ * d is the diamagnetic susceptibility of the Fermi gas with the dispersion ξ k . This also implies that the compressibility of the system is finite. \n\nIII. Q=2KF DENSITY-DENSITY RESPONSE FUNCTION\n\nIn this section, we study the q = 2k F density-density response function in the lowest-Landau-level theory. The difficulty in finding the finite wavevector response function comes from the fact that one needs to know the scattering vertex function Γ(k, k ′ , q, iω ν ) for arbitary q and ω ν . In principle, if one can find all the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the integral kernel, one can find the inverse of the integral operator and find the solution for Γ(k, k ′ , q, iω ν ). This turns out to be not an easy task for arbitray q and ω ν . \n\nIn the small limit, the nontrivial part of the integral kernel becomes \n\nwhich is concentrated at k = k F at zero temperature. \n\nIn this limit, both Ṽ (k − k ′ ) and the scattering vertex function can be expanded only in terms of cosℓθ k and sinℓθ k (ℓ = 0, 1, ...) because both k and k ′ are basically restricted on the Fermi surface [11]. If one takes only the ℓ = 1 modes, the eigenfunctions are just q • v k /q and q ∧ v k ′ /q. By finding the correspoding eigenvalues, one gets the expression of Γ(k, k ′ , q, iω ν ) in Eq.2.14 [11]. When q is not small, the tricks outlined above do not work. Fortunately, we can find at least one eigenvector which is correct for all q in the small frequency limit. This eigenvector can be found by use of the Ward identity and is given by ξ k+ 1 2 q − ξ k− 1 2 q with the eigenvalue tending to zero as iω ν → 0. This part of the vertex function can be explicitly found as \n\nOne can also show that Γ 1 (k, k ′ , q, iω ν ) exhausts the Ward identity in Eq.2.13 in the following sense. Let us consider the following quantity. \n\nwhere the definition of χ 0 in Eq.2.15 is used in going from the third to fourth lines. Notice also that, among two terms in the curly braket in the third line, the first term gives zero contribution to the k 1 -integral. Comparing with the Ward identity in Eq.2.13, one can see that Λ(k, q, iω ν ) is nothing but the one-particle-irreducible vertex Λ(k, q, iω ν ). Therefore, the full scattering vertex function can be written as \n\nNow, for notational convenience, let us rewrite the irreducible density-density response function as follows. \n\nχ irr LL (q, iω ν ) = χ a (q, iω ν ) + χ b (q, iω ν ) + χ c (q, iω ν ) , \n\nwhere \n\nLet us investigate χ a and χ b first, then consider χ c later. \n\nWhen the momentum transfer is given by q = Q 0 ≡ 2k F q, one can see that k ± 1 2 Q 0 can be rewritten as \n\nWe can also easily see that \n\nwhere p ∧ q is the component of p perpendicular to q. \n\nIn the low energy limit |ω| ≪ ε F (here ε F ≡ ε |k|=kF ), we have p∧q ≪ k F in the imaginary part of the analyticallycontinued response functions χ(q, iω ν → ω + i0 + ). In this case, restoring l 2 B = (2/ φ)k −2 F in the expression, the exponential factor in χ a can be expanded as \n\n(3.9) Thus the imaginary part of χ a (Q 0 , ω) in the low energy limit can be written as \n\nwhere χ ⊥ 0p (q, iω ν ) is given by Eq.2.17. After changing the integral variable from k to p defined via k ± 1  2 Q 0 = ±k F q+ p, one can take the low frequency approximation |ω| ≪ ε F and p ∧ q, p • q ≪ k F to find the imaginary part of χ ⊥ 0p (Q 0 , iω ν ). Here we can use \n\nSimilarly, we get \n\nAfter finding the imaginary part, the leading order behavior of the real part can be also found by the Kramers-Kronig relation with a frequency cutoff that depends on the details of the interaction potential. Finally, we get \n\nwhere C 1 is a constant that depends on the details of the single-particle spectrum ξ k . Recall that ε F = ε |k|=kF . In the case of the quadratic band, \n\nUsing Eq.3.13, the low frequency limit of Imχ a (Q 0 , ω) can be estimated as \n\nSimilarly, Imχ b (Q 0 , ω) can be evaluated by expanding the exponential factors. Notice, however, that the expansion in the linear order in il 2 B 2k F p ∧ q will give zero contribution to the integral because of the symmetry of the integrand. Thus one has to keep the terms that are second order in il 2 B 2k F p ∧ q. After some algebra, we obtain the following result in the low frequency limit. \n\n(3.15) \n\nIn the low frequency limit, one can also show that \n\nwhere D 1 is a constant that depends on the details of the single-particle spectrum ξ k . In the case of the quadratic band with the effective mass m * , we get D 1 = 1 with 2m * ε F /k 2 F = 1. Using Eq.3.13 and Eq.3.16, the leading order contribution to Imχ b (Q 0 , ω) can be estimated as \n\nNow let us consider χ c (q, ω). In principle, in order to evaluate χ c for finite q, one needs to know the form of Γ 2 (k, k ′ , q, iω ν ) for arbitrary k and k ′ . This is a difficult task because the form of Γ 2 cannot be obtained from Ward identities. As a result, Γ 2 will, in general, depend on some detailes of the given potential Ṽ (q). Some progress can be made, however, if the momentum transfer q is given by Q 0 = 2k F q. It is also worthwhile to notice that, due to the identity given by Eq.3.5, Γ 2 (k, k ′ , q, iω ν ) is an odd function of k ∧ q and k ′ ∧ q. In fact, the small q limit of Γ 1 (k, k ′ , q, iω ν ) becomes the first term in the expression of the small q limit of the full scattering vertex in Eq.2.14. Thus the second term in Eq.2.14 can be regarded as the small q limit of Γ 2 . This form, of course, cannot be easily generalized to the case of arbitrary q and ω. \n\nLet us investigate the integral equation for Γ(k, k ′ , Q 0 , iω ν ) given by Eq.2.11 more closely in the small ω ν limit. In order to make a progress, let us define p and p ′ such that k ± 1 2 q = ±k F q + p and k ′ ± 1 2 q = ±k F q+p ′ . In the imaginary part of χ c (Q 0 , ω), we have p ∧ q, p ′ ∧ q ≪ k F in the low frequency limit. This means that k − k ′ = p − p ′ ≪ k F . In this case, it is reasonable to assume that Ṽ (k − k ′ ) = Ṽ (p − p ′ ) can be expanded in terms of p • q, p ′ • q, p ∧ q, and p ′ ∧ q. \n\nOne can see that similar consideration applies to the k 1 -dependence of the kernel of the integral equation in Eq.2.11 as far as the frequency ω ν is sufficiently small. One has to, however, introduce a cutoff in the p 1 integral after changing the variable from k 1 to p 1 . This cutoff depends on the details of the potential Ṽ (q). In view of the structure of the integral equation, it is also reasonble to assume that, in the low frequency limit, the scattering vertex Γ(k, k ′ , Q 0 , iω ν ) can be expanded in terms of p • q, p ′ • q, p ∧ q, and p ′ ∧ q. In fact, these are the eigenfunctions of the integral equation in the low frequency limit. More explicitly, the integral equation in the low frequency limit may be rewritten as \n\nwhere \n\nand ′ represents the fact that there is a cutoff in the p 1 -integral. The solution for Γ(p, p ′ , Q 0 , iω ν ) can be written as \n\nOne can see that the integral equations for the first and the second terms are decoupled. The first term is nothing but the q = Q 0 limit of Γ 1 in Eq.3.2. Thus we know exactly what λ 1 (Q 0 , iω ν ) is. The second term would correspond to a contribution from Γ 2 . The explicit form can be found from the integral equation as \n\nin the small ω limit. Using Γ 2 obtained above, we now evaluate Imχ c . In the low frequency limit, the exponential factor can be again expanded by assuming that l 2 B k ∧ q = l 2 B 2k F p ∧ q ≪ 1 or p ∧ q ≪ k F . Substituting Γ 2 in Eq.3.21 to the expression of χ c in Eq.3.7, we get \n\nIn the low frequency limit, the leading order contribution is given by \n\nCombining χ a , χ b and χ c , we can see that Imχ b is the leading order contribution in Imχ irr LL (Q 0 , ω). Therefore, in the low frequency limit, we have \n\nIn the next section, we will compare this result with that of the Chern-Simons theory. \n\nThe irreducible density-density response function in the Chern-Simons theory at arbitrary q and ω was previously calculated and has the following form [4]. \n\nwhere χ 0 (q, ω) and χ ⊥ 0 (q, ω) are given by Eq.2.15 and Eq.2.16 with the quadratic dispersion ξ k = k 2 /2m * − µ. \n\nIn the case of the quadratic band, in the low frequency limit, it can be shown that the leading order results are given by \n\nUsing the results above, the imaginary part of χ cs (Q 0 , ω) in the low frequency limit can be estimated as \n\nNotice that the density-density response function in the Chern-Simon theory, Imχ cs (Q 0 , ω), has the same √ ω dependence as that of the density-density response function, Imχ irr LL (Q 0 , ω), in the lowest-Landau-level theory. \n\nHowever, the coefficients are different. In fact, the ratio between them becomes \n\nThis ratio is, in general, nonuniversal number which depends on the details of the interaction potential Ṽ (q). In order to get some feelings about how small or large the ratio can be, let us take the HF dispersion relation, ξ k , being quadratic in k with the effective mass m * . In this case, and C 2 1 /D and the ratio approaches to 1/81 = 0.012 as φ becomes an infinitely large even number. Of course, these numbers cannot be taken seriously on the face value because the HF dispersion is quadratic only for small |k| ≪ k F and the dispersion relation for larger |k| affects also these numbers. However, it may be suggestive for certain purposes. In the next section, we will use these estimations to discuss the results of the recent phonon drag experiment. \n\nV. DISCUSSION ON THE PHONON DRAG EXPERIMENT \n\nRecently, the drag resistivity between two ν = 1/2 layers was measured when the layer separation is much larger than the magnetic length (or typical interparticle spacing) in each layer. In this case, the contribution to the drag resistivity from the interlayer Coulomb interaction is substantially suppressed and the electron-phonon interaction becomes the dominant source of the scattering. Theoretically, the drag resistivity can be evaluated from [16,18] \n\nU 21 (q, ω) ε(q, ω) \n\n2 Imχ 1 (q, ω)Imχ 2 (q, ω) \n\nwhere χ 1,2 are the density-density response functions and n 1,2 the electron densities in layer 1 and 2. U 21 is the interaction between the electrons in different layers and ε is the interlayer dielectric or screening function. The details can be found in Ref. [16] and Ref. [18]. If the interaction is dominated by the phonon-mediated interaction, U 21 is given by the interlayer electron-phonon interaction. When two layers are identical, the matrix element for the drag resistivity invloves [Imχ(q, ω)] 2 . Let us first discuss the situation of the zero applied magnetic field. The phonon-mediated drag occurs by transfering momentum q of the phonon to excite the particle-hole continuum of electrons. At zero temperature, the particle-hole continuum ceases to exist if the momentum transfer q is larger than 2k F at low frequencies. Formally, this means that Imχ becomes very small if q > 2k F in the low frequency limit. Thus when the phonon energy ω ph = cq becomes larger than c(2k F ), the scattering is suppressed. At finite temperature T , the typical phonon energy is set by the temperature scale so that, if T > T 0 = c(2k F ), the drag resistivity is substantially suppressed. This is why there is a maximum of ρ 21 around T ≈ T 0 in the measured phonon-mediated drag resistivity. \n\nIn the case of the ν = 1/2 double-layer system, the underlying ground state is the composite fermion Fermi sea. Naively, one may expect that the drag resistivity will have a maximum around T ≈ T 1/2 > T 0 where \n\nHere k cf F is the Fermi wave vector of composite fermion system. In the experiment, the maximum of the drag resistivity occurs at a temperture that is even smaller than T 0 [13]. \n\nIn order to invetigate the theoretical consequence in detail, Bonsager, MacDonald, and the author calculated the phonon-mediated drag resistivity in the Chern-Simons theory [16]. In fact, since the electron density-density response function is not simply proportional to the densitydensity response function of composite fermions in the Chern-Simons theory, it is not obvious whether the naive expectation is valid even in the Chern-Simons theory. They found that [16] 1. If the effective mass of composite fermions is sufficiently small such that the effective Fermi energy is substantially larger than T 1/2 , the naive expectation is more less correct. That is, the maximum occurs around T 1/2 . \n\n2. When realistic values of the effective mass are used, however, the effective Fermi energy is not very small compared to typical temperature scale we are looking at (such as T 1/2 ). As a result, there are significant finite temperature effects leading to the shift (not necessarily monotonic as a function of the effective mass) of the maximum position. \n\n3. any case, the maximum of the drag resistivity occurs always at a temperature larger than T 0 . Thus the theory cannot explain the large downward shift of the maximum position. Now the question is what happens in the lowest-Landau-level theory. In order to evaluate the drag resistivity in the lowest-Landau-level theory, one needs to know, in principle, the imaginary part of the densitydensity response function for arbitrary frequency and wavevector. This may be necessary especially because the effective Fermi energy is not much larger than the temperature scales we are interested in. Evaluation of the density-density response function at arbitrary q and ω in the lowest-Landau-theory is not an easy task because one has to solve the scattering vertex function Γ for arbitrary wavevector and frequency. Also the finite wavevector response function would contain nonuniversal contribution which may depend on the details of the given interaction potential Ṽ (q). \n\nIn this paper, we evaluated the imaginary part of the density-density response function of electrons for q = 2k F in the low frequency limit. Thus the full evaluation of the drag resistivity is beyond the scope of the present paper. However, based on what we got in the last section, we may be able to speculate what might happen to the drag resistivity within the lowest-Landau-level theory. We found in the last section that the imaginary parts of the density-density response functions in the Chern-Simons and lowest-Landau-level theory (Imχ cs and Imχ irr LL ) have the same √ ω dependence in frequency at q = 2k F in the low frequency limit. It may appear that this is a disappointing result because the lowest-Landau-theory does not provide qualitatively different results. \n\nHowever, we also learned that the ratio between Imχ LL and Imχ cs can be quite different from unity. For the sake of the order of magnitude estimation, if we use a quadratic approximation for ξ k in the lowest-Landaulevel, Imχ irr LL /Imχ cs ≈ 0.2 for ν = 1/2 as shown in Eq.4.6. In the expression of the drag resistivity in Eq.5.1, the imaginary part of the density-density response enters as [Imχ] 2 . If the behavior of Imχ irr LL /Imχ cs for larger frequencies is similar to that of the low frequency limit, the contribution from the scattering events with q near 2k F to the drag resistivity in the lowest-Landau-level theory would be ∼ 1/25 times smaller than that of the Chern-Simons theory. This implies that the large wavevector scattering may be quantitatively more suppressed in the lowest-Landau-level theory compared to the case of the Chern-Simons theory. \n\nIn fact, according to the experimental data, the smallest drag resistivity in the measured temperature range is only ∼ 20 times smaller than the maximum value. Thus, if the drag resistivity near T 1/2 = c(2k F ) is ∼ 1/25 times smaller than the expected value, it may appear that the maximum occurs at a much smaller temperature scale, T max 1/2 < T 1/2 . The discussion above is based on the density-density response function at q = 2k F in the low frequency limit. Thus, at this stage, the discussion above is only suggestive and not the satisfactory explanation. It appears that numerical calculation of the response function is necessary to understand fully the phonon drag experiment. \n\nVI. SUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we consider finite q density-density response function of the compressible Fermi-liquid-like states in the lowest Landau level. In particular, we evaluated the q = 2k F density-density response function in the low energy limit within the lowest-Landau-level formalism. We compare this result with the prediction of the Chern-Simons theory. We found that the density-density response functions in both cases are proportional to √ ω in the low frequency limit. However, the coefficients can be quite different and the ratio between them is a nonuniversal number. We found that the response function at q = 2k F in the lowest-Landau-level theory can be substantially smaller than that of the Chern-Simons theory. Using these results, we speculate that the lowest-Landau-level theory may explain the suppression of the q = 2k F scattering seemingly observed in the experiment on the phonon-mediated drag resistivity in the double layer ν = 1/2 system. However, the satisfactory understanding of the phonon drag experiment may require numerical evaluation of the density-density response function. \n\nFinally, we would like to mention various other possibilities which were not considered in this paper. The lowest-Landau-level theory in the present form through the time-dependent HF approximation may turn out to be inadequate for describing the large q or short distance behaviors of density-density response of the composite fermions. This is because the picture of the correlations between the electrons and vortices itself may break down at short distances due to the fact that we are looking at the length scale comparable to the distance between the electrons and vortices [19]. The theory, if it exists, which describes this situation and the crossover or transition from the present lowest-Landau-level theory to this regime may provide better understanding of the finite q response of the system. In any case, our work should serve as a useful starting point for understanding more microscopic picture of the compressible states in the lowest Landau level. \n",

While such landscapes may not be Three large carnivores are present in semiarid landscapes with high human densities and poor wild prey abundance challenging present-day Indian wildlife management narratives. compatible with certain species' ecologies (Karanth, Nichols, Ullas Karanth, Hines, & Christensen, 2010) or species may show statistical avoidance of these areas (Bouyer et al., 2015), they can provide acceptable habitat and facilitate persistence of other species (Prange & Gehrt, 2004;Yirga et al., 2017). Although this challenges traditional approaches to conservation, these landscapes are predicted to become common in the future (Dobrovolski, Loyola, Guilhaumon, Gouveia, & Diniz-Filho, 2013;Lindenmayer et al., 2008). While some species populations have recovered by the creation of unmodified protected areas (PAs) (Walston et al., 2010), land-sharing holds the promise of letting other species persist in the long term by increasing connectivity between PAs and expanding the total size of populations. Many wide-ranging and low-density species that occur outside state-institutionalized reserves cannot be restricted to the current PA network (Chapron et al., 2014;Rodrigues et al., 2004). Exploring alternative approaches is pertinent for accommodating human needs and conservation goals, especially in the face of rapidly changing landscapes (Crespin & Simonetti, 2019).\n\nThe wide-ranging nature of large carnivores produces an overlap between their distributions and human-modified areas (Johansson et al., 2016;Sanderson, Redford, Vedder, Coppolillo, & Ward, 2002), potentially posing threats to human lives and livelihoods. This may lead to carnivore population declines and loss of community support for conservation (Treves & Karanth, 2003). However, a congruence of carnivore resilience (Chapron et al., 2014;Mech, 2017), conservation policy (Swenson, Linnell, Swenson, & Andersen, 2015;Treves & Karanth, 2003), and local acceptance of carnivores (Carter & Linnell, 2016) has enabled carnivores to persist in \"shared spaces\" in many countries (Lindenmayer et al., 2008). While Europe and North America are witnessing recolonization of large carnivores in human-modified landscapes following their mass persecution (Chapron et al., 2014;Smith, Nielsen, & Hellgren, 2016), countries like Australia (Newsome et al., 2014), Ethiopia (Yirga et al., 2017), Brazil (Vynne et al., 2011), Iran (Hosseini-Zavarei, Farhadinia, Beheshti-Zavareh, & Abdoli, 2013, India (Athreya, Odden, Linnell, Krishnaswamy, & Karanth, 2013), Kenya (Van Cleave et al., 2018), and Israel (Barocas, Hefner, Ucko, Merkle, & Geffen, 2018) have also recorded large carnivore presence in mix-use landscapes. These studies demonstrate the complex and evolving relationships between people and predators, challenging earlier generalizations about co-adaptation in shared spaces (Linnell, Swenson, & Andersen, 2001;Woodroffe, 2000).\n\nBesides being the second most populous country in the world, India is also one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. This entails large-scale land-use conversions with intensive irrigation-assisted agriculture to increase production, industrialization, and urbanization to accommodate economic interests (Sudhira, Ramachandra, & Jagadish, 2004;Tian, Banger, Bo, & Dadhwal, 2014). Despite these conservation challenges, India still retains high diversity and densities of large carnivores (Karanth, 2011). Although high densities of humans and wildlife in India have historically co-occurred in shared spaces, management and research on large-bodied wildlife is mostly focused on populations inside PAs, which cover <5% of the country's land area known (Ghosal, Athreya, Linnell, & Vedeld, 2013). For instance, large carnivores use of humanmodified habitats, their interactions with humans, and their life histories in these landscapes are very poorly understood, and there is a need for the conservation discourse to expand to human-modified landscapes (J. R. B. Miller, Linnell, Athreya, & Sen, 2017).\n\nAmong the various shared landscapes in India, arid and semiarid regions present a unique set of problems. These have sparse tree cover and could not support taxable livelihoods and the British colonial administration wrongly recognized them as degraded \"wastelands.\" This designation has shaped their current governance, which rarely regards them as important ecosystems (Ratnam, Tomlinson, Rasquinha, & Sankaran, 2016;Whitehead, 2010), and they are easily converted for agriculture, infrastructure development, and industrial use (P. . Most regions have gradually transformed from rain-fed systems to intensively irrigation-fed permanently cropped lands, or become hotspots of industrialscale infrastructure, thus creating fragments of semiarid lands. There is an emerging threat from the proposed National Forest Policy of India (F. No. 1-1/2012-FP [Vol.4], 2018), which proposes to increase \"forest cover\" on semiarid and desert tracts, clearly indicating the lack of ecological understanding of these unique ecosystems.\n\nIn this study, we focused on three wide-ranging carnivore species-the leopard Panthera pardus, the Indian gray wolf Canis lupus pallipes, and the striped hyena Hyaena hyaena, to (a) examine the ecological and anthropogenic factors that facilitate their persistence in a large multiuse semiarid landscape (~89,000 km 2 ) co-inhabited by high-density human populations and (b) determine the patterns of occurrences of these species in this landscape. Among these species, leopards are better represented in research from outside-PAs, most likely because they pose serious management challenges (Athreya et al., 2015;Kshettry, Vaidyanathan, & Athreya, 2017). The ecological requirements of wolves and hyenas in human-use areas, however, remain largely unknown. Based on the observed distribution patterns, we make inferences on the social, management, and policy attributes that could aid in the conservation of these large carnivores in shared semiarid landscapes, outside the PA network.\n\n| MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n| Study area\n\nWe chose seven districts in western Maharashtra (Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, and Kolhapur), which together cover 89,853 km 2 of primarily semiarid human-dominated landscapes (Figures 1 and 2). Districtlevel human population densities range from 266.48 to 602.63 people/km 2 (2011 India census; https://www. census2011.co.in/census/state/districtlist/maharashtra.html; accessed June 13, 2017). The landscape is highly heterogeneous; the western fringes abutting the Western Ghats are more forested and receive higher rainfall (average monsoon rainfall June-September = 230 mm).The central and eastern parts of the study area receive less rainfall (average monsoon rainfall = 90 mm), and are dominated by arid habitats with a grassland-cropland mosaic (http://hydro.imd.gov.in/ hydrometweb/(S(r4sf5srela3ca3zdvw4mkaep))/DistrictRainfall. aspx; accessed June 13, 2017; http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/; accessed February 13, 2016) (Roy et al., 2015).\n\nThe region has three large river basins (the Godavari, Krishna, and the Bhima), where agricultural intensification through irrigation has modified arid habitat in the past few decades, where cultivated areas are dominated by sugarcane, millet, grapes, paddy, soya, and other cash crops (District Census Handbook http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/ dchb/DCHB.html;accessed July 17, 2017 Habib & Kumar, 2007). Along with the tiger Panthera tigris, which was present in the landscape historically , the region originally had a diversity of medium-to-large-sized ungulate herbivores; gaur Bos gaurus, sambar Rusa unicolor, and chital Axis axis in the western parts, and blackbuck Antilope cervicapra and chinkara Gazella bennettii in the central and eastern parts (Karanth, Nichols, Hines, Karanth, & Christensen, 2009), although these are now sparsely present outside the few PAs and their fringes.\n\n| Study design\n\nWe assessed carnivore distributions in human-dominated areas and excluded protected reserves (national parks and wildlife sanctuaries), which formed less than 3% of the total sampled area. We collected detection/nondetection information on all three carnivores under an occupancy framework (MacKenzie et al., 2018), treating 305 forest administrative units called \"rounds\" as independent sampling units (hereafter, \"sites\"). We collected these data through interviews with forest department field staff as our key informants who were active in the field at least during the previous 12 months and were therefore likely to provide reliable information. The average area of the sites was 299.52 km 2 (±19.11 [standard error [SE]). Because we wanted to examine true occupancy and not habitat use, almost all sites were considerably larger than the estimated home range sizes for all species (120-300 km 2 for wolf [Habib, 2007;Jhala & Giles, 1991]; 6-50 km 2 for leopard [Odden, Athreya, Rattan, & Linnell, 2014]; 6-10 km 2 for hyena ). We conducted interview surveys from January to July 2015, treating F I G U R E 1 A map of the study area depicting land cover with protected areas, major cities and sampling unit boundaries overlaid on it each interview as an independent replicate (1-18 interviews per site; Srivathsa, Puri, Kumar, Jathanna, & Karanth, 2018). We assumed that a site's occupancy status did not change during the one year for which data were collected (Rota, Fletcher, Dorazio, & Betts, 2009). Relying on administrative boundaries as sites (rather than a grid-based design) allowed us to accurately describe the spatial limits of the sites to the respondents (see Pillay, Johnsingh, Raghunath, & Madhusudan, 2011), and also obtain sufficient number of replicates at this spatial scale.\n\nOur protocol for eliciting interview responses was: (a) We asked all questions in the local language Marathi, (b) detection/nondetection records were based only on firsthand sightings of the species (dead or alive) over the past 12 months; indirect signs such as scat, tracks, or calls reported by the respondent were not recorded to avoid potential misclassifications (D. A. Miller et al., 2011), and (c) each respondent was presented with photographs of the focal species for identification. If the respondents identified the species correctly, we further enquired about the morphological and behavioral traits of the species to which if the respondent was unable to give the correct details, their response was discarded. Alternately, for cases where the respondent was unable to identify species altogether from the photograph on the first attempt, we described behavioral and morphological characters of the species to them and a second attempt at identification was allowed. If the species were not identified even after this, their response was discarded. Hence, only those respondents who could describe the species or assign morphological and behavioral traits to each species was considered. In all cases where the respondent reported the presence of a species, we recorded the name of the closest village, habitat where the species was seen, and its behavior as observed by the respondent. Since oral consent was obtained from each respondent prior to the interview, we did not obtain approval from any human ethics committee before the data collection.\n\n| Covariates for modeling species occupancy and detectability\n\nWe collected information on land use/land cover, human population, domestic and wild prey availability as predictors for modeling occupancy probability (ψ; probability of species presence in a site) of leopards, wolves, and hyenas (see Figures S1-S3 in Appendix S1). Similarly, we used information on respondent's field experience, their ability to identify other species and the number of respondents (effort) in each site to model detection probability (p; probability of detecting the species, given its presence in the site). For the former, we derived remotely sensed land-use/land-cover information from the Bhuvan-Indian geo-platform of Indian Space Research Organisation (http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in [accessed February 13, 2016]) and (Roy et al., 2015). We chose absolute land-use area values as covariates for predicting ψ since the use of proportion of each category within differently sized sites would lead to loss of information on minimum habitat requirements for the species. We obtained site-specific numbers of domestic animals and people from the All India Livestock Census 2012, Government of India and the All India Population Census 2011 (http:// censusindia.gov.in/ [accessed January 20, 2015]), respectively. We calculated both abundance and densities of domestic livestock in each site; the former reflects minimum prey requirement and the latter accounts for accessibility of prey per unit area, both of which could be relevant as predictors. We collected information on the presence of the two most widely distributed wild prey species (chinkara and blackbuck) in each site as part of the interview surveys (Table 1). As a surrogate for the abundance of wild prey, we calculated the proportion of respondents who reported a presence for either chinkara or blackbuck for each site.\n\nFor all three carnivore species, we selected covariates following a priori predictions based on field observations and published literature concerning their natural history (Table 1). Broadly, we predicted that (a) leopard presence would be positively associated with higher degree of tree cover or permanent crop cover (because of F I G U R E 2 A map showing distribution of human densities in the study area (the categories have been fixed to represent equal counts of units) the refuge it provides in human use landscapes) and abundance/densities of medium and large domestic prey, but negatively with urban habitation (Athreya et al., 2015;Kshettry et al., 2017), (b) wolf presence would be positively influenced by open dry habitats including grasslands, seasonal crop cover, abundance of antelope, and medium-sized domestic prey, but negatively by forest cover and urban habitation (Habib & Kumar, 2007;Jethva & Jhala, 2004;M. Singh & Kumara, 2006), (c) hyena presence would be positively influenced by dry habitats with scrub cover, permanent crop cover like has been recorded in parts of the landscape, abundance of medium-sized domestic prey and poultry farms, but negatively by open dry habitats and urban habitation P. Singh, Gopalaswamy, & Karanth, 2010).\n\nWe predicted that detection probability would increase with longer field experience of respondents (≥10 years) and with the number of respondents interviewed per site (Guillera-Arroita, 2017). Being the only large felid in the landscape, leopard identification was generally unambiguous. Since this was unlikely for wolf and hyena, we considered that respondents' ability to identify the other carnivore (i.e., identify hyena when recording for wolf and vice versa) would affect detection and used this binary 0/1 index as a reliability score in modeling p.\n\n| Analytical methods\n\nIf a species sighting was confirmed by a respondent in the past year, we recorded it as a single \"1\" (irrespective of more than one sighting), while nondetection by a respondent was recorded as a single \"0\" and detection histories were created accordingly for all. We used the program PRESENCE 12.10 (Hines, 2006) to estimate ψ and p using the standard single-season occupancy model (MacKenzie et al., 2018). We used a two-step process to predict the two parameters of interest: ψ and p (Doherty, White, & Burnham, 2012). We first performed model selection to predict p, while keeping a general additive structure for ψ constant. Here, we tested all possible combinations of covariates to examine singular and additive effects. The model with the best relative fit for p was chosen based on Akaike information criterion (AIC; K. P. Anderson & Burnham, 2002), and was kept constant while building models for ψ. In the case of ψ, we first simplified the global model by dropping those predictors whose SE values were higher than their β estimates. We then examined model ranking by building competing models with either singular or additive effects of the remaining covariates which were compared against the null model based on AIC values, and also allowed for assessment of top model performance (Mac Nally, Duncan, Thomson, & Yen, 2017). We concluded on our top models depending on which ranked within ΔAIC of 2.0 of the top most model. However, we calculated averaged occupancy estimates (with associated standard errors) across all models for each site and present the β estimates for each covariate from the top most model it figured in from the entire set. Since differing occupancy probabilities might be a function of unequally sized sampling units, we examined top model performance by additionally including the area of the sampling unit as a covariate provided it was not highly correlated (r > |0.7|) with other covariates. Because they represented the same category of predictor, we refrained from using domestic prey \"abundance\" and \"densities\" in the same model although these non-nested models were compared together using AIC values (D. Anderson & Burnham, 2006). We standardized all covariates using zscore conversions and examined them for cross-correlations; covariates with a correlation of Pearson's r > |0.7| were not used together in the same model.\n\n| RESULTS\n\nWe obtained adequate data through interviews (1,626 interviews; 1-18 interviews per site) for only 295 sites out of 305, since for 10 of these respondents were not available. After filtering out data from those respondents who could not identify the species correctly, less than 5% of the remaining respondents required a second attempt at identification for any of the three species. Because of this low proportion, assuming that this category of respondents would have introduced an upward bias in detection estimates due to false positives, we did not consider these separately for explicitly conducting false-positive analysis. We created detection/nondetection matrices with data from 289 sites for leopards, 279 for wolves and 286 for hyenas. Leopard presence was recorded in 150 sites (naive occupancy = 0.51), wolf in 161 sites (naive occupancy = 0.57), and hyena in 179 sites (naive occupancy = 0.62). We compared 20 covariate models for leopards, 26 for wolves, and 18 for hyenas to predict occupancy probability. For all three species, no single model fully supported the data better than other competing models; three models for leopards (cumulative AIC wt. = 0.76), three for wolves (cumulative AIC wt. = 0.78), and four for hyenas (cumulative AIC wt. = 0.85) ranked within ΔAIC ≤ 2.0 (Tables 2-4), indicating that these were similar in their performance. We intended to assess top model performance by including \"sampling unit area\" as a predictor. But these models either did not converge or the predictor was highly correlated with other covariates and was therefore excluded. Model averaged p for leopards was 0.87 (SE = 0.01) and the model-averaged ψ across all was 0.57 (SE = 0.007) (see Figure 3). For wolves, average p was 0.75 (SE = 0.01) and model-averaged ψ was 0.64 (SE = 0.01) (see Figure 4). Average p for hyena was estimated at 0.78 (SE = 0.01) and model-averaged ψ across all models was 0.75 (SE = 0.009) (see Figure 5).\n\nDetection probability for leopards was best explained by respondents' experience in the field (10 years and above) (top model estimate β exp.10 = 0.51 [SE = 0.14]). For wolves, p was positively influenced by respondents' field experience and also the number of respondents in each site (top model estimate β exp.10 = 1.07 [SE = 0.13]; β no.resp = 0.28 [SE = 0.06]). In case of hyenas, p was most explained by the respondents' ability to identify wolves, but correlated poorly with field Leopard presence was positively influenced by the extent of permanently cropped areas (associated with high degree of irrigation) and densities of cattle, whereas it was negatively influenced by densities and abundance of medium-sized livestock (sheep and goats together; usually present in larger numbers in the drier areas), built-up areas and forested regions; of which the latter two were supported poorly. Wolf presence was strongly favored by abundance as well as densities of medium-T A B L E 1 List of covariates used to model occupancy probability ψ and detection probability p for the three carnivores A priori predictions for each species: \"−,\" negative influence; \"+,\" positive influence; \"NA,\" not applicable, not used to model occupancy for the corresponding species.\n\nb\n\nCovariates combined into single category for one or more species. sized livestock (sheep and goats), abundance of the chinkara antelope and by area under seasonal agricultural cover (both irrigated and nonirrigated) but negatively favored by dry forests and built-up areas. Hyena presence was strongly favored by sheep and goat densities, abundance of dogs, and broiler fowl (weaker support), while dry plains with sparse vegetation cover and built-up areas had a negative effect (weak statistical support). See Table 5 and Tables S1-S3 in Appendix S1) for β-coefficient values for each covariate and model comparisons, respectively.\n\n| DISCUSSION\n\nNonforest lands outside the purview of state-managed reserves are generally undervalued in supporting large carnivore populations in India. Although most species' geographic ranges overlap with human-dominated landscapes, ecological assessments are disproportionately focused on PAs (Ghosal et al., 2013). We interviewed only trained informants, attempted to eliminate false positives through a fixed protocol (see Methods), and encountered a low proportion of respondents who required a second attempt at identification. Although false positive records likely result in overestimation of state and sampling parameters, we have reason to believe that for our focal species, such biases would be minor (see Pillay, Miller, Hines, Joshi, & Madhusudan, 2013). Using hierarchical occupancy models, we establish that a primarily semiarid landscape spanning over c. 89,000 km 2 , of which only 2.6% is under wildlife reserves, harbors leopards across 57%, wolves across 64% and hyenas across 75% of its area (see Figures 3-5). Among the 295 sites sampled, 210 (c. 44,000 km 2 ), 154 (c. 72,000 km 2 ), and 157 (c. 59,000 km 2 ) sites had occupancy probabilities higher than the corresponding mean estimates of the same for leopards, wolves, and hyenas, respectively. We interpret areas with high occupancy probability as areas that may support sustainable populations (see Royle & Nichols, 2003). An area of 22, 896 km 2 (25% of the study site) was found to have high probability of occurrence (above estimated mean value of ψ) for all three carnivores species together, which also supported human densities ranging from 59.32 to 1,169.26 people/km 2 (see Figure 6).\n\n| Agricultural lands as carnivore habitats\n\nLand conversions to agricultural use, accompanied by urbanization, have led to widespread modifications of arid and semiarid lands (Bestelmeyer et al., 2015;Ramankutty, Evan, Monfreda, & Foley, 2008). However, carnivores such as black bears Ursus americanus, cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus, wolves C. lupus pallipes, and jaguars Panthera onca have shown resilience and adapted to agricultural landscapes (Behdarvand et al., 2014;Blanco & Cortés, 2007;Boron et al., 2016;Ditmer et al., 2015;Winterbach, Winterbach, Boast, Klein, & Somers, 2015  , and their presence has been documented in other production landscapes with prey elsewhere in the country (Athreya et al., 2015;Kshettry et al., 2017). Although dry grasslands have been representative habitats for wolves in India (Jethva & Jhala, 2004), seasonal agriculture better favored their presence compared to fragmented dry grasslands in the landscape. Wolf presence in such areas (with no crop cover for certain parts of the year) may stem from their preference for open areas for hunting prey and the associated presence of medium-sized domestic livestock (as prey),which commonly graze in these lands. The presence of hyenas was not significantly associated with any particular land use, but they appeared to avoid large tracts of seasonally fallow arid lands with sparse vegetation.\n\n| Urban area expansion and degrading wastelands\n\nThe expansion of urbanscapes to accommodate rural-urban migration is often at the cost of modifications of grasslands and scrublands (Vanak et al., 2017). Indian policy has often classified savanna ecosystems under human-use as \"wastelands\" or degraded lands (Ratnam et al., 2016). Hence, such areas are likely to undergo intense alteration because of their T A B L E 3 (i) Top additive models run to predict detection probability p for wolves while keeping a constant structure for occupancy probability ψ and (ii) top additive model results for predicting wolf occupancy probability ψ against the null model Abbreviations: built, built-up area in km 2 ; chink, measure of chinkara abundance; dry, natural drylands in km 2 ; dry.for, dry forest cover in km 2 ; exp.10, experience above 10 years; grs, dry grassland cover in km 2 ; hyena.id/wolf.id, ability to identify hyena or wolf respectively; resp, no. of respondentsper site; shpgt, sheep and goat abundance.\n\nconversion to irrigated farmlands, industrial areas with associated infrastructure (e.g., solar farms) and commercial monoculture plantations, all of which is accelerated with government policies and subsidies. Such expansion of urban environments is expected to gain momentum in our study landscape. While urban landscapes may sometimes favor carnivore presence, as with the coyote Canis latrans and puma Puma concolor in North America (Gehrt et al., 2010) and the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta and African wolf Canis anthus in Ethiopia (Yirga et al., 2017), these may also be avoided due to factors like hunting pressure (Abade et al., 2018). All three large carnivores in our study demonstrated statistical avoidance of urbanscapes, this effect being weaker for leopards compared to wolves and hyenas. Leopards in India and some areas of Africa are known to inhabit periurban and suburban areas Van Cleave et al., 2018), subsidized by anthropogenic factors, which has enabled them to thrive in considerable densities in close proximity to humans. However, built-up lands are associated with hotspots of human activities and hence, some species such as wolves and hyenas may avoid them. However, even though a statistical avoidance of highly urbanized areas was observed, these species are known to exhibit flexibility in activity patterns, which has enabled them to thrive in other parts of the landscape that have low levels of human activity (Boydston, Kapheim, Watts, Szykman, & Holekamp, 2003;Theuerkauf, 2009). Landscapes with no wild prey presence (Athreya, Odden, Linnell, Krishnaswamy, & Karanth, 2016), or those with very low prey densities or diversity (Khorozyan, Ghoddousi, Soofi, & Waltert, 2015;Pimenta, Barroso, Boitani, & Beja, 2017), have frequently sustained carnivore populations because domestic livestock (as prey or as carrion) serves as a primary source for the wild carnivores in such regions. Livestock losses have sometimes been accepted (Inskip, Carter, Riley, Roberts, & MacMillan, 2016), or have resulted in retaliation especially if accompanied by attacks on humans (Carter & Linnell, 2016). At least one species of domestic prey was associated with the presence of each of the three carnivores in our study area. Cattle densities supported leopard occurrence, a pattern that is consistent with previous observations in this landscape (Athreya et al., 2016). Sheep and goat densities favored wolf and hyena occurrence and just like the leopard's case, wolf diet studies in the landscape have also shown high dependence on livestock (Habib, 2007). Interestingly, hyena presence was associated with abundance of a greater variety of domestic prey, including domestic dogs and poultry fowl. It is possible that hyenas in human-dominated landscape are dependent on poultry and other waste (Yirga et al., 2017), which also attracts dogs, thereby explaining the association between dogs and hyena presence.\n\n| Carnivore conservation in shared landscapes\n\nIn landscapes shared by humans and large carnivores, there is an increased interface that could endanger the welfare of both people and wildlife. In terms of a direct threat to human life, western Maharashtra had 91 officially documented instances of human attacks from 2014 to 2016 (roughly coinciding with our study duration) most of which (93%) were by leopards. Such incidents remain a major challenge in the shared spaces of India, particularly for wide-ranging carnivores that cannot be confined to PAs. Acceptance of losses to carnivores and subsequent large carnivore persistence in the vicinity of humans has strong roots in the sociopolitical and cultural factors (Dickman, 2010). One such factor is the absence of lethal control of carnivore populations in India, which has perhaps supported shared landscapes. Unfortunately, the cultural and socio-political attributes of people-predator interactions have been examined cursorily at broad spatial scales (Karanth et al., 2009), or, completely discounted because they cannot be quantified in the same way as ecological assessments. It is increasingly evident that the social and cultural factors probably play a much more important role in influencing large carnivore persistence (Aiyadurai, 2016;Athreya et al., 2018;Redpath et al., 2017). In shared landscapes, the presence of potentially \"problematic\" carnivores that receive active State protection could create alienation of people (Naughton- Treves & Treves, 2005) and fuel human-human conflict (Redpath et al., 2012). However, in a country such as India, where rural communities have shared space with wildlife for a very long time, we know very little of the socio-cultural mechanisms and behaviors (of both humans and wildlife) that support the sharing of spaces. The human-dominated landscape we consider in this study has hosted human civilizations since at least 200 B.C. (Sontheimer, 1989), while leopards, wolves, and hyenas have inhabited the Indian subcontinent for between 0.4 and 0.1 million years (Rohland et al., 2005;Sharma, Maldonado, Jhala, & Fleischer, 2004;Uphyrkina et al., 2001), and it is clear these landscapes have long supported both together. But several questions about these T A B L E 5 The β estimates with associated standard error values for all covariates from the top models in which they occur (from the candidate set of models run) for each species interactions remain unexplored, for example, (a) what kind of agricultural practices are wildlife-friendly, (b) how sociopolitical changes like agricultural intensification or land abandonment due to human migration affect carnivores, or (c) how will changes in husbandry methods from open grazing to stall-fed practices affect carnivore diet, (d) how will livestock depredation patterns change over time and whether this will affect acceptance of carnivores by people. It is important that policy paradigms, which are currently PAcentric and rely on reactive measures, adapt to incorporating such knowledge so that conflicts between managers and local people can be avoided or reduced and enable conservation on shared lands. Our results highlight the presence of large carnivores in changing landscapes (Lindenmayer et al., 2008) and that there are species-level consequences to land conversions that are neither fully understood nor integrated into the current paradigm of wildlife management. We call for a shift away from the three dominant narratives in Indian conservation policy-(a) associating sparsely vegetated semiarid landscapes with an absence of biodiversity and subsequent removal of the colonial tag of \"wastelands,\" (b) the urge to expand monocultures to increase tree cover in semiarid landscapes, and (c) ideologically confining large mammals to the extant PAs. In a densely populated country like India, advocating coercive actions such as imposing absolute state control and enforcement of wildlife protection without incorporating power relations, local sentiments, and values (say in the case of criminalizing traditional hunting practices) may not be an ideal strategy in the long term for wildlife that has historically shared space with humans (Redpath et al., 2012).There is a need for (a) an overhaul of obsolete and parochial approaches to conserving large carnivores, especially ineffective management interventions that focus on removal or translocation of animals rather than engaging with local communities on effectively managing shared spaces, (b) thinking of novel frameworks relevant to India's evolving landscapes, like promoting socially responsible interventions that are transparent and focus on measuring conservation performance like wildlife population counts and reduced losses to humans (Mishra, Young, Fiechter, Rutherford, & Redpath, 2017;Ravenelle & Nyhus, 2017;Zabel & Holm-Müller, 2008) or formulating programs which encourage modification of human behavior (Schultz, 2011;Treves & Karanth, 2003) to ensure their safety in shared spaces, and (c) understanding and acknowledging the role of socio-cultural factors that allow for shared spaces to exist and decentralizing the process of conservation with more socially inclusive programs. If large carnivore populations are to be retained in human-use areas, this shift will require an expansion of the skills and tools used by wildlife managers (J. R. B. Miller et al., 2017). Future research will need to augment this with multidimensional assessments that incorporate social and political domains from disciplines like the humanities and social sciences.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe study was funded by the Rufford Small Grant Foundation, Wildlife Conservation Society-India Program, and the Maharashtra State Forest department.

The Hippo pathway is a central regulator of organ development, tissue repair after injury and stem cell fate [2]. The pathway is composed by a regulatory module and a transcriptional module. The first encompasses kinases and adaptors whereas the second is composed by two closely related transcriptional cofactors acting downstream the core regulatory module: TAZ and the Yes-associated protein (YAP). The core module prevents YAP/TAZ nuclear accumulation and interaction with transcriptional partners (e.g. TEAD1-4), refraining YAP/TAZ-driven gene transcription [2]. Deregulation of the Hippo pathway and pervasive activation of YAP/ TAZ was observed in a variety of tumors and linked to a number of tumor-promoting activities, spanning from malignant transformation and metastatic dissemination to chemoresistance and self-renewal of cancer stem cells [2]. In GC, YAP knockdown had detrimental effects on cell proliferation, invasion and motility, and the inhibition of the YAP-TEAD interaction hindered tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo [3,4]. \n\nMutations in central components of the pathway have rarely been detected in cancer genome studies [2]. Thus, a common belief is that deregulation of the Hippo pathway is mostly driven by the dysfunctional nature of stimuli that physiologically fine-tune its activity. Indeed, the Hippo cascade is collocated at the centerpiece of an intricate regulatory network that includes determinants of cell polarity and cell-cell junctions, kinases acting upstream the regulatory module, mechanical forces (mechanotransduction), soluble factors acting through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and Rho GTPases, and metabolic routes [2]. Recently, evidence is accumulating conveying the message that the Hippo signaling cooperates with other deregulated pathways in a process that ignites aberrant YAP/TAZ activity. For instance, YAP/TAZ are functionally concatenated with the Wnt pathway whose key components, in turn, are frequently mutated in various tumor types, even including GC [5][6][7]. Consistently, the expression of TAZ along with Wnt pathway mutations (APC, CTNNB1 and FBXW7) negatively impacts survival outcomes in advanced GC patients [1]. \n\nAdding further complexity to this picture is the Janusfaced relationship between the Hippo pathway and p53. In a TP53 wild-type background, YAP and Hippo kinases cooperate with p53 in inducing a tumor suppressive response that culminates into senescence, apoptosis or differentiation [8]. This process is further bolstered by positive feedback loops, given that YAP induces p53 transcription that, in turn, activates YAP and LATS2 transcription. Conversely, in a TP53 mutated context, YAP and mutant p53 forms a complex that promotes the transcription of key cell cycle regulators including cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 [8]. Thus, the biological output of this transcriptional program is an increase in cellular proliferation. \n\nHere, we investigated the clinical significance of the YAP-p53 partnership in GC, relying on tissue samples from 83 GC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy either in prospective phase II trials or in routine clinical practice. Samples had been already characterized for the expression of a battery of protein-and gene-level biomarkers, also including YAP assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TP53 mutations evaluated through targeted DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) [1,9]. A detailed description of reagents, procedures and statistical analyses was provided elsewhere [1,9], whereas baseline characteristics of GC included in this analysis are detailed in the Additional file 1. \n\nGiven that the goal of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of YAP-mutant p53-mediated transcription, we generated a molecular model that combined nuclear YAP expression in association with TP53 missense mutations. Thus, we did not consider positive tumors that harbored other types of mutations (i.e. stop-gain mutations). This is consistent with the documented pattern of TP53 alterations necessary for interacting with YAP. We referred to this background as the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature. We did not record any significant association between the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature and clinical-pathological factors potentially affecting survival outcomes (data available upon request). Moreover, when individually considered, neither YAP expression nor TP53 mutations were associated with shorter PFS (log-rank p = 0.284 and 0.209, respectively). \n\nThe YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature is an independent predictor of longer progression-free survival\n\nThe individual distribution of YAP expression and TP53 mutations is presented in Additional file 2, along with the nature of TP53 mutations. Patients whose tumors carried the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature had longer PFS compared with their negative counterparts (log rank p = 0.038) (Fig. 1). This latter group was defined as YAP expression without TP53 missense mutations (wild-type or TP53 stop-gain mutations) and samples with negative YAP expression, irrespectively of the presence or absence of TP53 mutations. The protective significance of the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) model was retained in a multivariate Cox regression analysis built by adjusting for other plausible predictors of PFS (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30-0.91, p = 0.022) (Table 1). We have previously described two other signatures associated with adverse survival outcomes, the first denoting the TAZ/Wnt pathway crosstalk (TAZ pos /WNT mut) and the second indicating the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) network (γ-H2AX pos /pATM pos ) [1,9]. Thus, we verified whether the protective role of the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) model was maintained also when taking into account the two aforementioned molecular backgrounds. A molecularlyfocused multivariate Cox regression analysis enforced the  idea that the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) model holds a protective role (HR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-0.99, p = 0.045) independently of other molecular contexts, and also confirmed the robustness of the H2AX pos /pATM pos and TAZ pos / WNT mut signatures (Additional file 3). Moreover, we did not find any association between the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) model and the other two signatures (H2AX pos /pATMpos and TAZ pos /WNT mut Chi squared test p = 0.759 and p = 0.817, respectively). Internal validation performed through the bootstrap method confirmed the stability of the model. \n\nThe impact of the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature on overall survival is dependent on post-first-line chemotherapy \n\nWe finally verified whether the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) model was associated with better OS. Unexpectedly, we did not record any significant association in the entire cohort (univariate Cox for OS: HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-1.11) (Fig. 2). Prompted by this observation, we reasoned that the connection between YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) and OS might be tied to the administration of chemotherapy beyond the first-line setting. This hypothesis is rooted in the transcriptional output of the YAP-mutant p53 complex, which up-regulates various cell cycle controllers and culminates into increased cellular proliferation. Consistently, we observed that Ki-67 levels, assessed in a subgroup of samples, were significantly higher in YAP+/ TP53 mut(mv) -positive vs negative cases (p = 0.031) (Additional file 4). On this premise, we tested the subgroup of patients who received second-line chemotherapy, and the subset of patients who did not receive chemotherapy beyond the first-line setting. With this approach, we noticed that the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature was associated with a decreased risk of death exclusively in patients who received second-line (and eventually subsequent) chemotherapy (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.83) (Fig. 2). This observation was confirmed in a multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.81, p = 0.013) (Table 2). Collectively, these findings corroborate the idea that the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature favorably impacts survival outcomes, and that its protective role is linked to the administration of chemotherapy. \n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study capitalizes on a growing body of evidence that assigns oncogenic functions to the YAP-p53 cooperation [8]. In order to address the clinical relevance of such a vicious interaction, we evaluated a relatively large  series of advanced GC patients treated with chemotherapy. Approximately half of the patients examined were enrolled in prospective phase II trials. Our results suggested that a molecular background registering YAP-p53-driven transcription, and consequently accelerated neoplastic proliferation, is associated with better survival outcomes. The link between the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature and clinical outcomes emerged when we exclusively considered oncogenic TP53 missense variants. This is consistent with a mutational pattern necessary to encode a protein able to interact with YAP. It is worth mentioning that in a molecularly-focused multivariate Cox regression analysis, the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) model was associated with a decreased risk of disease progression independently from the two other signatures we had previously identified [1,9]. The observation that the three signatures retained their predictive value enables us to exclude potential confounding factors. \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report striving to address how two cooperating oncogenic forces, namely YAP and mutant p53, impact survival outcomes in advanced GC patients. The seemingly paradoxical finding that the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature is associated with better survival outcomes in chemotherapy-treated GC raises some interesting points. First, even though YAP is an established tumor-promoting factor, in some instances tumor-suppressive functions have been described [10]. For instance, (i) YAP interacts with, and stabilizes, p73 leading to transcription of pro-apoptotic target genes, (ii) as aforementioned, in the absence of TP53 mutations the crosstalk between YAP and p53 leads to the induction of cell death stimuli, (iii) YAP is negatively regulated by oncogenic AKT, and (iv) in some cases such as breast cancer, multiple evidence side with a tumor suppressive function of YAP, including both frequent loss of heterozygosity at 11q22.2 and mechanistic studies [10]. Thus, while YAP is widely perceived as an oncogene, in some contexts it seems to be endowed with tumor-suppressive capabilities. In GC, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that YAP boosts tumor progression [3,4], whereas our data point to YAP as a biomarker of greater efficacy of chemotherapy in a TP53-dependent manner. The explanation of such inconsistency may be fairly intuitive. The YAP-mutant p53 transcriptional program accelerates cellular proliferation by up-regulating master regulators of the cell cycle; this, in turn, should increase chemosensitivity. Consistently with this hypothesis, the relationship between the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) model and OS was strictly dependent on the administration of chemotherapy. Indeed, OS analyses revealed that the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature was associated with better OS exclusively in the subset of patients who received second-line chemotherapy, whereas this relationship was lost in the subgroup of patients who were not treated with chemotherapy beyond the first-line setting. Thus, the model we propose is that an oncogenic process fueling the proliferation of neoplastic cells turns into a vulnerability trait upon exposure to chemotherapy. The observation that tumors carrying the YAP+/TP53 mut(mv) signature have higher Ki67 levels is consistent with our hypothesis. It is worth mentioning that we were unable to perform comparable analyses in publically available datasets (e.g. TCGA). Indeed, other independent databases do not contain the necessary information to verify our findings including PFS, extensive data on administered chemotherapy throughout the natural history of the disease, and YAP expression/localization at the protein level (to our knowledge, RPPA data in the TCGA contains the phosphorylated, and therefore inactive, form of YAP). Nevertheless, the stability of our signature was confirmed with the bootstrap method, representing the most accurate procedure for internal validation. \n\nAnother aspect that needs to be considered is that the interaction between the Hippo pathway and p53 extends beyond the molecular frame herein investigated [8]. For instance, p53 also cooperates with the Hippo kinases. LATS2 stabilizes p53, whereas the silencing of LATS1 and LATS2 modifies p53' conformation and interactome, shifting p53 function toward a mutant-like state that promotes cell migration. Beyond p53, YAP also associates with p73 leading to the transcription of pro-apoptotic target genes such as PUMA and p53AIP1. Taking into account the multi-level interaction between the Hippo signaling cascade and p53 family members [8], in our opinion a deeper molecular characterization is needed to fully appreciate the clinical implications of such cooperation. To address this issue, we designed a prospective study with biomarker validation purposes on the basis of our previous results [1,9]. The trial envisions an extensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis that will enable us to carry out an integrated pathway-focused analysis. This will be instrumental to achieve a deeper understanding of this process. \n\nFinally, the molecular characterization of GC revealed the existence of four molecular subtypes: chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI), genomically stable (GS) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive [7]. Deregulation of the Hippo pathway in GS-GC is suggested by RHOA and CDH1 mutations, along with CLDN18-ARHGAP26 fusions [7]. All these alterations impact established regulatory branches of the Hippo pathway such as Rho GTPases, cell-cell adhesion mechanisms and cell polarity factors. Moreover, EBV-related GC is characterized by DNA hypermethylation, and both MOB1B and WWTR1, the gene encoding for TAZ, present frequent promoter hypermethylation [7]. Thus, the molecular taxonomy of GC adds further complexity to a yet intricate phenomenon, raising the idea that individual molecular subtype deserves increased attention in studies striving to assess the clinical exploitability of the Hippo-p53 communication. \n\nConclusions\n\nCollectively, our data suggest that the YAP-mutant p53 interaction denotes a subset of advanced GC with better survival outcomes. Our hypothesis is that this unexpected association is rooted in a pro-proliferative program triggered by YAP and mutant p53 proteins, that render cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapyinduced death stimuli. Wider molecular analyses within the context of prospective studies are warranted to provide further evidence on how this information can be transferred to the clinical setting. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nBetween January and September 2012, a teacher and four students at a technical college in Marseille, France, developed pulmonary tuberculosis. All Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from these cases were identical and belonged to the Beijing strain family, multispacer sequence type 72, a rare genotype identified only once in our laboratory in the previous two years. This report highlights once more the potential for M. tuberculosis Beijing strains to cause outbreaks, this time in a school setting. \n\nAmong the different genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenic to humans, the Beijing strains -first described 20 years ago in the Chinese capitalare now known to have a global distribution [1,2]. The Beijing strain family is characterised by its potential to cause epidemics and its association with drug resistance [3,4]. Several outbreaks of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to M. tuberculosis Beijing have been reported in congregate settings such as homeless shelters [5] and prisons [6]. We report on a recent outbreak of pulmonary TB cases attributed to M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype in a school. \n\nOutbreak description\n\nIn January 2012, a 20-year-old male (Case 1) attending a technical school in Marseille, in southern France, was diagnosed with pulmonary TB and mediastinal lymph node involvement. Direct microscopy examination of three sputum specimens did not detect acid fast bacilli (AFB) but M. tuberculosis was cultured from the sputa and broncho-alveolar fluid. The strains were susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid and the patient was successfully treated using a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. In mid-June 2012, a 42-year-old teacher at the same school (Case 2) was also diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He presented with fever and weight loss as well as a cough that had lasted for the previous six months. Radiology showed extensive lesions in both lungs with multiple cavitations. Three sputum samples yielded an average of 100 AFB per microscopy field and M. tuberculosis susceptible to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs was cultured. \n\nResponse to first-line drug combination therapy was favourable and no AFB were detectable on sputum microscopy after two months. In early July 2012, as part of the investigation of these two cases by the local public health authorities for TB control, pulmonary TB was diagnosed in a second student in the same school (Case 3) who presented both clinical and radiological signs. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture from sputum specimens, which also isolated drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis. \n\nContact tracing\n\nThese cases of pulmonary TB clustered in time and place led to a broader investigation including a total of 334 individuals associated with this school in 2012, comprising students, teachers and administrative personnel. All were tested with interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) and 30 tests were interpreted as positive. Those who tested positive were put on prophylactic medication with isoniazid. Family members of the three patients who had been in regular contact with the three and 20 other persons in a factory where Case 1 was a trainer were also examined by symptom screening, followed by X-ray, and then sputum microscopy. In September 2012, this investigation led to the detection of subclinical pulmonary TB in two students (Cases 4 and 5) attending the same class as Case 3. In both cases, culture of respiratory tract samples yielded drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates. \n\nThe investigation led to the hypothesis that the teacher (Case 2) was the source case of this outbreak. The source case had no identified risk for TB from significant contact outside the school or a previous history of TB. Given that his clinical signs and symptoms were initially attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to heavy smoking, the diagnosis of TB was delayed and only confirmed after that of Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 were considered to have been exposed in the class in which the teacher taught. In addition, the teacher gave truck-driving lessons to the students of this class three times per week with each session lasting four consecutive hours. No direct contact between Case 1 and the teacher was established. \n\nLaboratory investigations\n\nM. tuberculosis isolates collected in all five cases were sent to our reference laboratory for further analyses. Molecular testing using a marketed assay (GenExpert, Cepheid, Maureus-Scoport, France) [7] confirmed the identification of M. tuberculosis and detected no mutations associated with rifampicin resistance. Susceptibility testing using conventional liquid culture showed no resistance to all first-line antimycobacterials. Real-time PCR genotyping targeting the intergenic region Rv0927c-pstS3 [8] and a second region specific to the Beijing family [9] confirmed a Beijing genotype for all isolates. Multispacer sequence-typing (MST) [10] identified a genotype MST72 and confirmed that the isolates were indistinguishable. Our laboratory had only detected this genotype once previously among 174 strains of M. tuberculosis genotyped since 2010 (data not shown) in a patient born in Thailand and residing in France who had no known contacts with the cases reported in the current outbreak. \n\nConclusions\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype infections occurring in a school. This is also the largest outbreak of pulmonary TB detected in Marseille area in the last 15 years: in this area, the other outbreaks have only occurred in penitentiary establishments. This report illustrates the highly pathogenic and highly contagious nature of the Beijing strain family, which requires a quick laboratory confirmation. This outbreak was characterised by the high contagiousness of the source case and a clinically-severe picture in three of the five cases detected. Prolonged contact within the confines of a truck cabin (with an approximate volume of six cubic metres) may confer a risk of TB infection not very different from that in a long-haul airplane flight [11]. This outbreak also illustrates the importance of contact tracing and laboratory investigation in improving the early detection of linked cases of TB and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease even in the presence of other conditions leading to chronic cough. As in this report, most cases of TB today are caused by organisms which are not drug-resistant and which can be cured using a standard treatment with combination of anti-TB drugs for at least six months [12]. Patients on treatment only require isolation until they are no longer infectious. Given that Beijing strains are particularly transmissible and often exhibit multi-drug resistance, France and other European countries are concerned with Beijing strain family of M. tuberculosis [13]. Schools should be integrated in nation-wide surveillance systems for TB in France. \n",

INTRODUCTION\n\nEndowing mobile robots with the ability to autonomously navigate has been viewed as a major challenge to realizing their full potential as autonomous embodied systems [1], [2]. In an autonomous navigation task, a mobile robot is typically asked to navigate collision-free from a start point to a goal point, sometimes without an accurate or complete prior map, and it is challenging to efficiently plan routes without prior knowledge. \n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) offers a way for embodied systems to acquire high-performance policies to operate in stochastic environments through trial-and-error learning [3]. Given no prior information describing the environment, a RL agent can learn by directly interacting with the environment. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combines RL with deep neural network architectures, and has been widely used to solve practical problems with high-dimensional sensory inputs in recent years. One of the earliest examples, DQN [4], was able to play Atari 2600 games to superhuman levels. DRL methods have also shown the ability to learn desired route planning policies in unknown stochastic environments, which can be efficiently executed via neural network inference at run-time. \n\nExisting DRL based route planners select the route that maximizes the expectation of accumulated rewards (e.g., the blue path in Figure 1), which may be associated with high variance and suffer from unstable performance across trials when the operating environment is highly stochastic. A possible solution is Distributional Reinforcement Learning (Distributional RL) [5], which aims at learning return distributions and enables various policies beyond expectation maximization. Recent works in this area (described below) have used Distributional RL to learn mobile robot controllers that can achieve safe navigation performance by avoiding actions with highly uncertain outcomes. \n\nIn this paper, we propose a route planning framework that learns environmental stochastitcity with distributional RL, and is capable of selecting a robust route with execution policies based on the second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) relation. The performance of our framework is demonstrated in simulated urban road network environments where travel time stochasticity exists in certain states. While state-of-the-art RL methods are agnostic to travel time stochasticity, our framework could plan routes that circumvent those states when robustness is preferred (e.g., the red path in Figure 1). The code of our approach is available at https: //github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/ Stochastic_Road_Network. \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces related works about RL based route planners and distributional RL based mobile robot controllers; Section III introduces the RL problem setup; Section IV introduces our proposed robust learning and execution framework based on distributional RL; Section V introduces the road network environments we build for studying the robust route planning problem; Section VI shows route planning experiment results and analysis; Section VII concludes the paper and comments on plans for future work. \n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nDeep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used to develop solutions to route planning problems in unknown stochastic environments. Qian et al. [6] considered the charging station navigation problem for electric vehicles in an urban environment with unknown uncertainty in traffic conditions, price and waiting time at different charging stations, and proposed a DRL based planner that could select a goal station and route that minimize travel time and charging cost. Zhang et al. [7] also worked on the route planning problem for electric vehicles, but with an emphasis on the power management issue; they used reinforcement learning to train a route planner that could efficiently plan paths that minimize overall energy consumption. Geng et al. [8] proposed a DRL based route planner that minimizes travel time by predicting pedestrian flows in congested environments; the proposed planner outperforms A* when congestion occurs. Koh et al. [9] proposed a DRL based real-time navigation system operating in complex city maps with varying traffic conditions; the system re-plans the route for the ego vehicle given its surrounding instant traffic information, achieving better performance in travel time than dynamic-Dijkstra and dynamic-A*. Basso et al. [10] studied dynamic route planning for electric delivery service vehicles where customer requests and energy consumption are stochastic, proposing a DRL based solution that learns to anticipate future customer requests and energy consumption, planning routes for delivery and battery charging that minimize energy consumption and prevent battery depletion. \n\nDistributional reinforcement learning (Distributional RL) has recently been used to learn risk-aware control policies in mobile robot navigation tasks. Choi et al. [11] focused on the indoor navigation of a mobile ground robot, and trained a distributional RL agent that could learn the collision risk of control commands (linear and angular velocity); the proposed method outperforms traditional RL in the collision avoidance success rate. Kamran et al. [12] designed a distributional RL based autonomous vehicle controller for automated merging and crossing at occluded intersections, where other vehicles' behaviors are uncertain; the proposed method exhibits adjustable performance that balances travel time and driving comfort according to user preference at run-time. Liu et al. [13] proposed an adaptive risk-aware control policy for a micro drone navigation task; the algorithm automatically adjusts the threshold of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) according to the level of environmental uncertainty during the learning of a distributional RL agent, which shows robust navigation performance without human effort in parameter tuning. Given that distributional RL has been proven to be effective in learning risk-aware policies, we use it to develop a high-level route planning framework that is robust to uncertainties in the environment. \n\nIII. PROBLEM SETTING\n\nUsing the standard problem setting for RL, the interaction between the agent and the environment is formalized as a Markov Decision Process (S, A, P, R, γ), where S, A, and are the set of states and actions. At each time step t, the agent receives an observation of the current state s t ∈ S, and decides an action a t ∈ A. It causes the environment transition to the state s t+1 ∼ P(•|s t , a t ) , and the agent receives an observation of s t+1 , as well as a reward r t+1 = R(s t+1 , a t+1 ). A common way to find an optimal policy in RL is to maximize the expected future return Q π . \n\nIt's also known as the action-value function, which starts with a state-action pair (s t , a t ) and follows the policy π thereafter. Discount factor γ ∈ [0, 1) controls the effect of future rewards. \n\nThe relation between Q π and its successors satisfies the Bellman equation (2), where s ∼ P(•|s, a), and a ∼ π(•|s ). An optimal policy could be solved using the Bellman optimality operator (3). \n\nT Z(s, a) : \n\nInstead of the expected return, Distributional RL algorithms [5] focus on the return distribution, which satisfies the distributional Bellman equation (4), where Z π (s, a) is a random variable that satisfies \n\nSimilarly, the distributional Bellman optimality equation ( 5) is used in this case. This permits the estimation of a collection of outcomes that could result from the stochasticity inherent in the agent's domain. For instance, if the reward encodes a robot's transition time, then its return distribution reflects the spread in total travel times that result from taking different routes whose random traffic conditions vary. \n\nIV. ROBUST LEARNING AND EXECUTION FRAMEWORK\n\nOur proposed robust learning and execution framework is illustrated in Figure 2. In the learning process, the agent interacts with the environment according to the behavior policy π β , and updates the return distribution Z(s, a; θ) with the learning policy π α . During the execution process, the agent decides the action to take with the learned return distributions Z(s, a; θ) and the execution policy π ψ . \n\nConsider an example when the learning and execution policies are the same. In this case, the robot would learn for some period of time, stop using its behavior policy, then start using its execution policy. In settings where robustness is desired, however, it can be beneficial to use a distinct execution policy to impose additional robustness preferences on decisions. \n\nA. Learning\n\nWe use QR-DQN [14] to learn return distribution Z(s, a), which is approximated with a uniform distribution of N Diracs, Z θ (s, a), where θ i is the value corresponding to the quantile τi = ( \n\nwhere \n\nDuring each training step, {θ i (s, a)} are optimized by performing stochastic gradient decent on the quantile regression loss L QR , which is computed with quantile TD error δ ij and quantile Huber loss ρ κ τ . \n\nWe use the greedy policy as the learning policy in optimization. \n\nB. Execution\n\nIn stochastic environments where a robot can experience multiple and potentially negative outcomes, it can be beneficial to impose an additional preference over outcomes so they are robust. Robustness here is specified with the dispersion of a given return distribution, and in the past it has been measured with statistics of the return distribution such as the variance [15] or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) [16]. Martin et al. [17] showed that policies based on the secondorder stochastic dominance (SSD) relation are aggregations of CVaR policies, and these can lead to optimal behaviors that favor robustness when multiple solutions exist. \n\nThe SSD relation is defined using distribution functions and compared over the set of their realizable values. Consider two expected returns, G and G , respectively induced by actions a and a . We say that G stochastically dominates G in the second order when their integrated CDFs, F (2) \n\nThe function F (2) defines the frontier of what is known as the dispersion space, whose volume reflects the degree to which a random variable differs from its expected value. Outcomes that are disperse have more uncertainty and are less robust when it comes to realizing consistent outcomes. Indeed, a fundamental result from expected utility theory states that rational risk-averse agents prefer outcome G to G when \n\nWe consider the SSD policy as an execution policy, which is based on the SSD relation. In settings where there is not an exact tie among the actions offering the largest expected returns, the SSD policy will be equivalent to the standard greedy policy. Otherwise, the SSD policy selects the action that is second-order stochastically dominant. Here we also introduce a relaxation to the SSD policy that permits uncertainty to be considered even when there is not an exact tie. The Thresholded SSD policy looks at the action gap between the top two optimal actions. When this is less than a certain threshold they will be considered equivalent, and the tie will be broken with a comparison of their second central moments, which eliminates the difference in expected values and is consistent with the exact SSD policy-namely, the action that induces the smaller second central moment will be preferred. Details of the SSD and Thresholded SSD policies are shown in Algorithm 1. \n\nAlgorithm 1 SSD and Thresholded SSD policy Require: use thres , ssd thres for all a ∈ A do \n\nV. THE STOCHASTIC ROAD NETWORK ENVIRONMENT\n\nTo examine the performance of the proposed framework on the urban driving route planning problem, we develop a simulation environment called the Stochastic Road Network Environment. The environment is built upon map topology and simulated sensory data originating from the CARLA autonomous vehicle simulator [19]. We select two maps from CARLA (0.9.6 version), Town01 and Town02. \n\nEach map in the proposed environment is procedurally generated. Starting from the continuous OpenDRIVE maps provided alongside CARLA, maps are extracted through a discretization process that produces a graph approximating the route-level topology of the original CARLA maps. The waypoint topology is initially represented in the OpenDRIVE road description format [20]-an industry-standard description language of road networks for use in autonomous vehicle simulation. The generation procedure produces maps with an offline data pre-processing script, which communicates with the CARLA simulator and generates static map graphs and observational data. For instance, the graph extracted for the CARLA Town01 road network is visualized in Figure 3. Given the extensibility of the CARLA simulator framework, the proposed environment generation method can be extended to cover any custom-made CARLA maps that include an underlying OpenDRIVE map graph. \n\nA. State and Action Space\n\nEach map in the proposed environment is a discrete and directed road network graph, where the state space is the set of all vertices in the graph representing all possible locations that the robot could visit. \n\nThe available actions at each state are determined by a discrete map of candidate state transitions, which correspond to edges in the graph. The dimension of the action space in the map is the largest number of available actions in any state. At states where the graph topology does not allow for use of the full action space (i.e., in the case of a straightaway, where there is only one valid direction of travel) the remainder of the action space corresponds to the loopback action, whereby the agent re-transitions into its current state. State transitions are fully deterministic, meaning every state-action pair yields a transition to a deterministic subsequent state. \n\nB. Observation\n\nThe CARLA simulator provides access to an array of rich sensor data-types. In this work, rich 3D LIDAR data is extracted from the CARLA simulator and post-processed into a form more amenable to usage with reinforcement learning methods. \n\nFirst, raw returns from a 32-beam, 360 • FoV simulated 3D LIDAR are extracted at each state location in the original CARLA environment. Next, this data is collected into a simple occupancy-map format on a per-state-basis, whereby the number of LIDAR returns per grid-cell are counted and stored in a 3D grid structure. This grid structure posesses a dimensionality of 255×255×3, and a size of 50 m×50 m× 8.4 m, with individual voxels of size 0.2m × 0.2m × 2.7m. Finally, a single 2D slice of this grid structure (255 × 255) is extracted for use as the environment observation at each environment state. The final observation is binarized, yielding a 2-dimensional matrix of size 255 × 255. Each cell is populated with a value of 1 if a non-zero number of LIDAR returns were present within the corresponding occupancy voxel, and 0 otherwise. A representation of the resulting observation format is shown in Figure 3. \n\nWhen the learning agent reaches a state, it perceives the corresponding observation matrix at that location. In this paper, we are focused on studying how route planning policies are affected by the environmental stochasticity induced by crosswalks where a vehicle may need to stop for pedestrians. Thus, observation noise is not modeled, and observation data is non-stochastic, with each binary matrix representing a static, unchanging observation returned from a specified state. Subsequent revisiting of a given state will always yield the same observation. \n\nC. Reward\n\nRewards are designed to reflect the travel time cost of passing states, and they are summarized in Equation (12). As most vertices are generated with fixed distances to neighbouring vertices, a fixed base action reward is present at all states to reflect the normal travel time cost, yielding a deterministic reward of −r base . In addition to this fixed action reward, there exist three categories of reward modifiers: goal states, crosswalk states, and loopback actions. \n\nGoal states, denoted as S G , are destinations of the agent, and reaching a goal state results in the end of a route and an additional reward +r base . Hence, the total reward of reaching a goal state is 0. \n\nCrosswalk states, denoted as S C , are the sole source of stochasticity within the environment, where travel time varies. We impose an additional reward sampled from a zero-mean truncated Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 1 and threshold bounds of −r base to +r base . Thus the total reward of reaching a crosswalk state range from −2r base to 0. \n\nLoopback actions are actions which result in the agent remaining in its current state. Loopback actions may incur an additional penalty r loopback , resulting in an effective loopback action reward of −(r base + r loopback ). \n\nVI. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\n\nUsing the Stochastic Road Network Environment, we study the route planning performance of our proposed framework, as well as that of state-of-the-art RL algorithms for comparison. Specifically, in section VI-A, we investigate the effect of different learning rates on the performance of selected state-of-the-art methods, and report our hyperparameter selection. In section VI-B, we apply the proposed framework to the route planning task, and compare its performance with others. \n\nA. Baselines Study\n\nWe select four state-of-the-art Deep RL methods, which are A2C [21], PPO [22], DQN [23], and Quantile-Regression DQN (QR-DQN) [14], and investigate their performance on the Stochastic Road Network Environment. In each map, a start state, a pair of goal states (permitting the goal to be reached from either side of a two-way street), and a crosswalk state (designed to lie within the shortest path of the map) are provided. The base reward r base = 1, and the penalty on the loopback actions r loopback = 0. Agents equipped with the selected methods are trained to learn route planning policies from the start state to a goal state, which are represented by end-to-end multilayer perceptron (MLP) models with the same structure introduced below. We evaluate a trained agent after every 10,000 steps of learning in the training environment. An evaluation occurs in a separate environment instance, where the agent starts from the same start state and stops when reaching a goal state or 1000 steps. The curves of discounted return (γ = 0.99) over the trajectories executed during evaluation, shown in Figure 4, can be used to analyze the learning performance of an agent. \n\nWe use implementations of A2C, PPO, DQN and QR-DQN from the Stable-Baselines3 project [24], and the variable names of hyperparameters used hereafter are the same as in the Stable-Baselines3 code. \n\nHyperparameter selection: Several hyperparameters were tuned for our experiments, described in detail below. \n\nFor A2C, n step = 64. This means the agent collects 64 on-policy transitions before updating the policy. All collected transitions are used to perform a one-step optimization to update the current policy, and then they are subsequently abandoned. \n\nFor PPO, n step = 2048, batch size = 64, and n epochs = 1. Thus the agent acts for 2048 steps with the current policy, and then the policy is updated by performing a one-step optimization with 64 samples randomly selected from 2048 collected transitions. Similar to the A2C agent, all n step transitions are abandoned after every policy update. \n\nFor DQN, buffer size = 2048, batch size = 64, and gradient step = 1. In contrast to A2C and PPO, DQN is off-policy, and we use the default -greedy policy for exploration. \n\nDuring training, it keeps a buffer of transitions obtained with previous policies and updates the current policy with minibatches from its replay buffer. The chosen hyperparameters indicate that a one-step optimization with 64 samples from the buffer containing 2048 previous transitions is performed to update the current policy. In this way, DQN is comparably parameterized with A2C and PPO. \n\nFor QR-DQN, we chose n quantiles = 4, meaning 4 atoms are used to represent the return distribution of a given action. We also set exploration fraction = 0.02 and exploration final eps = 0.1, meaning that the exploration rate of the -greedy policy starts at 1 and decreases linearly to 0.1 during the initial 2% of total training time steps, then stays at 0.1 thereafter; buffer size = 2048, batch size = 64, gradient step = 1. \n\nPolicy network structure: The route planning policy is represented by a fully-connected multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with four layers. The input layer takes a vector of the size 65,025 obtained by flattening the observation matrix. Next, there are two sequential hidden layers, each of which has 64 neurons. For A2C, PPO and DQN, the output layer gives estimated Q value of actions; for QR-DQN, the output layer gives gives quantile points reflecting the return distribution of actions. The action that maximizes estimated Q value or expected value of the return distribution is chosen as the final output. \n\nWe study the effect of different learning rates on the performance of the agents in each map. The range of examined learning rates is from 1 × 10 −6 to 1 × 10 −3 . For each agent and learning rate value, five trials with different random seeds are run, and the mean area under the learning curves over the trials is computed and used as a metric for evaluating the learning performance at each learning rate -the results are shown in Figure 5. The learning rates corresponding to the maximum mean area under the curve values are marked by stars, and summarized in Table I. Then for each agent in each map, we run another 25 trials with different random seeds, and plot the general performance over 30 trials in Figure 4.  Four agents learn planning policies that lead to the shortest path within about 5 × 10 5 steps of experience in most trials in Town01, and about 2×10 5 steps in Town02. In both maps, A2C and PPO achieve the best learning performance when the learning rate is around 1 × 10 −4 , while that of DQN and QR-DQN are not significantly affected by the learning rate. As the expected reward of a crosswalk state is −r base , which is the same as other states with a deterministic reward, agents learning greedy policies are agnostic to its stochasticity. \n\nB. Robust Route Planning under Uncertainty\n\nBased on the results of Section VI-A, the learning rate we choose for each agent is shown in Table II, and other  We use the same start state, goal states and crosswalk state as those used in the baselines study. The base reward r base = 3. As we are concerned with the effect of crosswalk stochasticity on route planning, a positive penalty on the loopback actions r loopback = 18 is used. In this experiment, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the planning policies. Similar to the baselines study, evaluation is performed in a separate environment after every 10,000 steps of learning. We run 30 trials with different seeds for each map, and plot the overall performance of each algorithm in Figure 6. We also plot the planned route of each algorithm during the final evaluation in Figure 7 and Figure 8. \n\nPolicy network structure: The route planning policy is represented by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with the following structure. The input is the observation matrix, of size 255 × 255 × 1. The first hidden layer convolves 16 filters of the size 8 × 8 with stride 4 with the input, followed by a rectifier. The second hidden layer convolves 32 filters of the size 4 × 4 with stride 2, followed by a rectifier. The third hidden layer convolves 64 filters of the size 4 × 4 with stride 2, followed by a rectifier. The fourth hidden layer convolves 64 filters of the size 3 × 3 with stride 1, followed by a rectifier. Two sequential fullyconnected layers, each of which has 64 neurons, follow that. Similarly, the output layer gives the estimated Q values of actions (A2C, PPO and DQN) or quantile points reflecting the return distribution of actions (QR-DQN). Note that for a QR-DQN agent, the output action is determined by its execution policy. \n\nIt can be seen that the results over the two maps are similar. We note that when equipped with the Thresholded Fig. 7: Planned routes of evaluated algorithms during the final evaluation in Town01 (Robust Route Planning). We also zoom in on the area where the Noisy path and the Robust Path diverge (Red rectangle box), and draw the critical state and its actions in red. In the action return distributions, red crosses mark learned quantiles, the central vertical bar marks the mean, and the distance between the central bar and a lateral short bar equals the variance. SSD policy, our proposed framework is the only one that learns to execute a high-quality robust route, which avoids travel time stochasticity and is still short in length. In Town02, the second and the third shortest paths are both free of stochasticity, and very close in length, thus it is relatively slow for the algorithm to learn to move from the third shortest path to the second second path. We denote the second and the third shortest path in Town02 as Robust Path 1 and Robust Path 2, respectively. \n\nFor our Town01 results (shown in Figure 7), besides the planned paths, we also show the return distributions of actions (learned by QR-DQN) at the critical state after which the Noisy path and the Robust Path diverge. It can be seen that the action leading to the Noisy path has a higher expected return but a greater variance, hence the Thresholded SSD policy favors the other action with less variance, while the expected return is still within the SSD threshold. \n\nFor our Town02 results (shown in Figure 8), we draw the action return distributions for two critical states. Critical state 1 decides whether to take the Robust Path 2 or the Noisy Path, and critical state 2 decides whether to take Robust Path 1 or the other two. It could be seen that at critical state 1 , the difference in variances is large, hence the proposed framework quickly learns to avoid taking the Noisy path. However, critical state 2 is more distant from and less affected by the crosswalk state, and the variance of the final learned distributions of both actions are quite close and small. Hence, this explains why the learning curve of QR-DQN (T-SSD) in Figure 6b converges slowly from Robust Path 2 to Robust Path 1. \n\nThe Greedy policy is agnostic to environment stochasticity, so it takes the Noisy Path in all trials. Because there are no exact ties in expectation, the SSD policy exhibits identical behavior to Greedy. As the Thresholded SSD policy plans a robust path at the price of a longer expected travel time, the user may select the stricter SSD policy if robustness is less preferred. DQN also learns a greedy policy that selects the shortest paths in both maps. \n\nHowever, A2C and PPO fail to learn a route to the goal in both maps, and it can be seen that they become stuck in loops. It is likely because they are on-policy algorithms, which may converge to a local optimal solution before sufficient exploration. Additionally, the penalty on the loopback action also leads to bias towards the other action and contributes to A2C and PPO converging to locally optimal solutions. \n\nVII. CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper introduces the Robust Learning and Execution framework for the route planning problem of mobile robots in unknonwn and stochastic environments. The framework learns environmental stochasticity with QR-DQN, and could use different execution policies according to user preferences on route robustness. We use the SSD policy, which is based on the second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) relation, to determine robust actions during execution, and we introduce a relaxation, the Thresholded SSD policy, that allows further preferences on robustness. Experimental results on a simulated road network environment show that our proposed framework could achieve adjustable performance with different execution policies: (1) Due to no strict tie in expected returns, the SSD policy selects routes that minimize expected travel time but with higher stochasticity; (2) When equipped with the Thresholded SSD policy, our framework could select short robust routes with minimum stochasticity in travel time, at the cost of higher expected travel time. \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n",

    "text": "\nIntroduction\n\n3][4] Whereas the vast majority of the annotated glycome exists as either lipid-or proteinmodified glycoconjugates, ''free'' (soluble or unconjugated) glycans represent an under-studied fraction of the glycome. From their initial discovery as plant defense signaling molecules 5 and modulators of host-pathogen interactions, 6 to the recent discovery of a mammalian disaccharide that induces autoimmunity, 7 it is becoming increasingly conspicuous that free glycans are important biological regulators. \n\nHuman milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a family of free glycans that are abundantly found in breast milk. 8,9 2][13] Some HMOs also display antimicrobial activity by acting as soluble decoys for pathogenic microbes or through inhibiting biofilm formation. 14,15 HMOs share a common lactose (Galb(1-4)Glc) core structure, which is often decorated with additional modifications, such as fucose or sialic acid residues (Fig. 1A). Importantly, such variants can impart vastly different biological activities. 16 Despite growing evidence demonstrating that HMOs impact diverse biology important to human health, a molecular understanding of the mechanisms and protein partners through which HMOs act remains limited. 12 imilar to glycoconjugates, the interactions of free glycans with glycan-binding proteins are relatively weak (K D B 10 À4 -10 À7 M), dynamic, and prefer the physiological presentation of proteins in live cells. 17 These inherent characteristics preclude the use of conventional affinity-based techniques, which require harsh sample preparation procedures. Although several methods have been developed to survey the protein-binding partners of glycoconjugates in live cells, these techniques have not been applied directly to the study of free glycans. 18 hus, we hypothesized that photoaffinity labeling could be applied towards the study of HMO interactions in live cells. 19,20 2][23][24][25] To enable identification of potential HMObinding proteins, we chose to utilize a 'fully-functionalized' enrichment tag composed of a photoactivatable diazirine group for UV light-induced capture of HMO bound protein targets and an alkyne handle for conjugation to azide-bearing reporter tags via copper-mediated azide-alkyne (CuAAC) ''click'' chemistry. 26,27 We synthesized four probes composed of the most abundant HMOs in human breast milk (lactose or Lac, 2'fucosyl lactose or 2FL, 3'sialyl lactose or 3SL, and 6'sialyl lactose or 6SL), and first cross-evaluated their engagement with purified glycan-binding lectins in vitro, followed by profiling their interactions with live murine macrophages. Using this strategy, we observed that the HMO probes interacted with hundreds of proteins encompassing several intracellular compartments, some of which interacted in a glycanmediated manner. Among these interactors were galectin-1 and galectin-3, which were validated as 3SL targets in live cells. \n\nResults and discussion\n\nUsing a similar experimental protocol previously reported by the Townsend group to prepare the 2FL probe (2), 28 the chemical synthesis of our photoactivatable HMO probes commenced with the Kochetkov microwave-assisted conversion of commercially available HMO hemi-acetals into their corresponding amine derivatives, 29,30 followed by amide bond coupling with a 'fully-functionalized' bifunctional diazirine-alkyne acid linker (see ESI †). The probes 1-4 were synthesized in 44% to 53% overall yields (Fig. 1A). ][33] With probes in hand, we evaluated their engagement with plant lectins in vitro. Plant lectins, such as LTL, MAL II, and SNA, are commonly used reagents to describe glycan patterns in cells. 5][36] Upon incubation of the probes with the plant lectins and UV-light irradiation at 365 nm, the mixtures were reacted with tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) azide via CuAAC, separated using denaturing SDS-PAGE, and visualized by in-gel fluorescence scanning and silver staining (Fig. 1C). 19 We observed dose-dependent (0-50 mM) photo cross-linking of probes 2-4 with the lectins (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1, ESI †), and cross-linking was dependent on UV irradiation. Consistent with the multi-subunit nature of plant lectins, we observed several bands in SDS-PAGE corresponding to lectin monomers, dimers, or oligomers (Fig. S1, ESI †). \n\nTo further evaluate the selectivity of the probes and determine whether the glycan recognition domains of the lectins were engaged, we performed a cross comparison analysis of different probes against individual lectins and used an array of excess unmodified HMOs as competitors. We observed that LTL was equally captured by probes 1 and 2, and excess 2FL abrogated the interaction with 2 but not with probe 1 (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A, ESI †). MAL II was engaged by all probes, with probe 4 showing maximum cross-linking. However, only the interaction with probe 3 was competed by excess 3SL. Although cross-linking with SNA was observed with probe 2 and probe 4, only the interaction with probe 4 was reduced by 6SL. We also evaluated the ability of unmodified soluble HMOs (Lac, 2FL, 3SL, 6SL) to reduce photo-crosslinking of the probes (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B, ESI †), and observed that the preferred glycan of \n\nCommunication\n\nRSC Chemical Biology each lectin is superior as a competitor molecule compared to other HMOs. We also note, however, that the interaction of probe 1 in the presence of excess Lac reduced photocrosslinking with LTL. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the known preferred glycan ligands are required for successful competition, and that, while probes can cross-react with non-binding lectins, incubation with an excess of the corresponding preferred glycan competes for specific interactions. \n\nWe next evaluated the ability of our probes to engage proteins in live RAW264.7 murine macrophages (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3A, ESI †), as the immunomodulatory activities of HMOs have previously been described in these cells. 11,37 In addition to the previously reported immunomodulatory roles, RAW264.7 cells are widely used in immunology due to their phenotypic and functional stability. 38 In brief, cells were treated with each probe, followed by exposure to UV light, harvesting, lysis, coupling of probe-modified proteins to TAMRA-azide and fluorescence visualization. We observed dose-dependent photo-crosslinking with probes 2-4 in cells, with protein targets engaged across a range of molecular weights. Photocrosslinking was observed to be dependent on the presence of the probe and UV, and probe labeling was significantly blocked by excess soluble HMO (Fig. 3B and Fig. S3B, ESI †), suggesting the selective capture of proteins that recognize the cognate free glycan. We also observed that proteins across multiple cellular compartments, including those that are located within cells were engaged by the probes (Fig. S4A-C,  ESI †). \n\nWe next sought to identify the protein targets of photoactivatable HMOs using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Briefly, following probe treatment and photocrosslinking, we used CuAAC to append a biotin-azide enrichment handle to crosslinked proteins, which were then enriched with streptavidin beads and digested with trypsin. The resulting \n\nRSC Chemical Biology Communication\n\npeptides were subsequently labeled with isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT) 39,40 to facilitate multiplexed, quantitative comparisons. We also included a control probe (5; see ESI †) to account for possible background interactions dependent on the enrichment tag alone. 19 Overall, we identified 512 proteins in this experiment (Appendix Table S1 As probe 3 engaged most of the proteins detected and its cognate free glycan (3SL) displays important immunomodulatory properties, 11,41,42 we pursued competition experiments to provide additional evidence that the identified targets bind 3SL. In these experiments, cells were pre-treated with excess 3SL prior to incubation with probe 3 plus 3SL and processed for proteomic analysis as described above. We observed excellent correlation between replicates (Fig. S6A, ESI †), and as expected from gel labeling experiments, we observed a strong, dosedependent reduction of global protein abundances with coincubation of the 3SL competitor (Fig. S6B, ESI †) and diverse competition profiles (Fig. S6C and D, ESI †). \n\nOverall, we identified 193 unique targets that were both enriched by 3 and competed with coincubation of excess free 3SL (42-fold, p o 0.05 at maximum competition; Appendix Table S2, ESI †). Notably, this list encompasses known glycanbinding proteins including Lgals1 (galectin-1), Lgals3 (galectin-3), and Gpnmb. We also observed proteins that have not been reported to exhibit glycan-binding activities, such as Pon3 (paraoxanase 3) and Acp6 (lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase type 6). 4][45] We selected galectin-1 and galectin-3 as targets for validation studies, which entailed over-expressing FLAG(DDK)-tagged galectin-1 or Histagged galectin-3 in HEK293T cells (Fig. S7A-C, ESI †). We observed robust photo-crosslinking of galectin-1 (Fig. 5A) or \n\nCommunication\n\nRSC Chemical Biology galectin-3 (Fig. 5B) by probe 3 in live cells, which was abrogated by excess 3SL. While galectins (expressed both intra-and extracellularly) [46][47][48] are commonly known to bind galactoseterminated glycans, they are also known to tolerate a(2,3)sialic acid substitutions. 49 Previous shotgun glycan array studies highlighted that galectins can also bind HMOs and may in some instances be receptors of HMOs. 50 Together, these data pinpoint high confidence interactors of probe 3 and demonstrate the capture of known glycan binders as well as unexpected proteins with affinity for HMO probes. \n\nConclusions\n\nWe have demonstrated that fully-functionalized HMO probes can be used to capture and identify potential HMO protein targets in live cells. Our finding that 3SL exhibits maximal interactions with proteins found in murine macrophages is intriguing, given recent findings that it induces transcriptional activation to resolve inflammatory responses, however further investigations are needed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. 11,41,42 Overall, these probes augment the existing toolkit to study of glycan-protein interactions in solution and in equilibrium, and we expect the datasets herein to facilitate our understanding HMO biological activity as well as other untapped free glycans. \n\nMethods\n\nDetailed information regarding the availability and sources of all reagents used as well as experimental procedures used are listed in the ESI. † All raw mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD035729. \n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts to declare \n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n   \n",

    "text": "\nAim: This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the mental health status and daily step count of adult individuals. Methods: The research was conducted between November 2023 and April 2024 with a descriptive cross-sectional design. The research population consisted of 386 individuals over the age of 18 who voluntarily filled out public electronic forums on online platforms. Data were collected with the socio-demographic characteristics diagnostic form consisting of 21 questions, the average number of steps in the last week, and the General Health Survey-28 (GHQ-28). Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics, normality statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), t test, Kruskal Wallis variance analysis, Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance level was accepted as p < 0.05 Results: GHQ-28 total score average was found to be 5.59 ± 6.52. 42.0% of the participants received a score of 5 or above on the GHQ-28 and were considered at risk for mental health. The individuals' average weekly step count was mean¼5269±3065 steps and 43% were basal-limited active. According to GHQ-28, the average weekly step count of individuals in the mental health risk group (4528.62 ± 2892.31) was lower than those who were not at risk (5804.63 ± 3081.67) (p < 0.05). According to step count categories, individuals who were basal-limited active (51.2%) and low active (39.4%) were found to be at higher risk for mental health than those who were slightly active (36.0%) and active-highly active (18.4%) (p < 0.05). A weak negative correlation was found between the average number of steps and the scores obtained from the GHQ-28 (r ¼ -.187; p ¼ 0.000). Conclusions: It was determined that more than half (51.2%) of the individuals (42.0%) in the risk group in terms of mental health were sedentary, that is, basal-limited active (less than 2500-4999 steps). \n\nKey messages:\n\n• Increasing awareness about the positive effects of individuals' daily step counts on mental health can contribute positively to the promotion of health. Methods: We conducted a systematic review on PubMed as well as government and NGO websites to identify public health initiatives in the prevention and early identification of mental illness among young individuals. \n\nResults: Preliminary results show that, while certain countries have delineated guidelines on how to support students' mental health, very few have implemented nation-wide, or even region-wide programmes that directly target prevention and education. A particular note should be made regarding substance abuse and addiction, one of the few illnesses for which many countries have already enacted in-school programmes, that however often overlook the medical aspect of such diseases. Of further note are certain local programmes aimed at offering quality and accessible care to adolescents struggling with mental diseases. \n\nConclusions: With psychiatric diseases projected to become one of the greatest contributors to the global burden of disease by 2030, and the importance of early intervention in preventing severe psychiatric illness, we advocated for European public health initiatives implemented in schools, which could be crucial in curbing the spread of mental illness. \n\nKey messages:\n\n• Adolescent and young adults are those most affected by the rising prevalence of mental illness. Consequently, we advocate for inschool programmes to aid in early identification and intervention. • Early identification of mental diseases is crucial in the prevention of severe psychiatric illness, but little has been done so far in terms of public health interventions to tackle such problems. \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n",

    "text": "\nIntroduction\n\nThe carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere plays an essential role in the study of global change for its potential to warm up the atmosphere and the surface. A better estimation of carbon fluxes over global ecosystems would help in better understanding each nation's contribution to global warming and improve global warming science. \n\nIn the past decade, many efforts have been made to estimate the surface CO 2 fluxes using both atmosphere-based top-down and land-based bottom-up methods. Carbon-Tracker (Peters et al., 2005(Peters et al., , 2007) may be one of the most advanced among these efforts. It uses an ensemble square root filter to assimilate atmospheric CO 2 mole fractions into an ecosystem model coupled with an atmospheric transport model. \n\nThe model state vectors in CarbonTracker are carbon fluxes only. However, the observed CO 2 consists of both initial state of atmosphere CO 2 and recently released carbon fluxes, and therefore including CO 2 concentration in the state vectors should improve the estimation of initial atmosphere CO 2 (Miyazaki et al., 2011). This could lead to further improvement of carbon flux estimation. Kang et al. (2011) and Liu et al. (2012) also added CO 2 concentrations to the state vectors due to their strong correlations with weather variables that are simultaneously assimilated. However, their efforts mainly focus on studying the performance of the assimilation methodology and observation settings by using idealized models only, not on assimilating real observations. \n\nThe length of the assimilation window in CarbonTracker is 5 weeks. This would include CO 2 observations far from the analysis time. However, this may not necessarily improve the flux analysis compared to an instantaneous analysis due to the attenuation of the detailed information as discussed by Enting (2002). A shorter assimilation window reduces the attenuation of observed CO 2 information, because the analysis system can use near-surface CO 2 observations before the transport of CO 2 blurs out the essential information of nearsurface CO 2 forcing (Kang et al., 2012). \n\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. \n\nS. Zhang et al.: A global carbon assimilation system\n\nIt is well known that correct estimation of the forecast error statistics is crucial for the accuracy of any data assimilation algorithm. In all existing ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilations for estimating carbon fluxes, the ensemble forecast errors are estimated by the difference of perturbed forecasts and their ensemble mean. The perturbed forecast errors are defined as the perturbed forecast states minus the true state. Motivated by the fact that the analysis state is a better estimate of the true state than the forecast state, Wu et al. (2013) proposed a new estimator for the perturbed forecast errors by using the difference between the perturbed forecast states and the analysis state. Moreover, they demonstrated through a simulation study that the new estimator can lead to better assimilations for models with large errors. Since the errors of ecosystem models are generally large, the new estimation of the perturbed forecast errors is potentially useful to improve EnKF assimilation for estimating carbon fluxes. \n\nBesides forecast errors, the observation errors also need be accurately estimated. In the majority of schemes for estimating carbon fluxes, including CarbonTracker, the observation error variances are not estimated but empirically assigned. The quality of the estimation of observation error variances critically depends on whether the forecast error covariance matrix is appropriately estimated (Desroziers et al., 2005). However, appropriate estimation of the forecast error covariance matrix is a challenge in real applications. \n\nIn this paper, we propose several modifications to the conventional EnKF for assimilating atmospheric CO 2 observations into ecosystem models. First, the model state contains both the surface carbon fluxes and atmospheric CO 2 concentration as suggested by Miyazaki et al. (2011), Kang et al. (2011) and Liu et al. (2012). Second, the analysis state is used to adaptively estimate forecast errors as suggested by Wu et al. (2013) and Zheng et al. (2013), and both forecast and observation errors are inflated as suggested by Liang et al. (2012). Finally, the 1-week assimilation window is tested against longer windows. This modified EnKF is used to assimilate real CO 2 concentration data into the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS; Chen et al., 1999;Liu et al., 1999;Mo et al., 2008) for estimating the real terrestrial carbon fluxes with 3-hourly and 1 This paper consists of six sections. The models and data used in this study are introduced in Sect. 2, while the methodology is described in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the validations of the new methodologies using the real observing system. A real data application of the proposed methodology is presented in Sect. 5. Conclusions and discussions are given in Sect. 6. \n\nModels and data\n\nSurface carbon flux models\n\nThe surface carbon fluxes mainly arise from fossil fuel combustion, vegetation fire, oceanic exchange, and biosphere. In this study, only the surface carbon fluxes from biosphere are simulated using BEPS, while the rests are taken from data sets of CarbonTracker 2011 (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ ccgg/carbontracker/). \n\nBEPS is a process-based ecosystem model mainly developed to simulate forest ecosystem carbon budgets (Chen et al., 1999;Ju et al., 2006;Liu et al., 1999). For many reasons, including the complexity of ecosystem processes, spatialtemporal variabilities, and representative errors, parameters in process-based models often do not represent their true values when these models are used to calculate carbon budgets over large areas or for long time periods (Mo et al., 2008). Errors in these parameters lead to biases in model results (other uncertainties, such as lack of knowledge on historical land use change and land management, also have influence on model results). In this study, we try to reduce biases in the BEPS-simulated carbon fluxes by incorporating atmospheric CO 2 concentration measurements with data assimilation methods. The prior carbon fluxes simulated by BEPS are at a spatial resolution of 1 • × 1 • and for every 1 h. On each model grid, BEPS calculates carbon fluxes of six different plant function types and outputs the sum of them through weighting the fluxes against areal fractions of the plant function types. Figure 1 shows the plant function types with the largest weight on each grid. \n\nThe vegetation fire flux is taken from CarbonTracker 2011 data set, which is modeled using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) biosphere model (Potter et al., 1993) based on the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED) (van der Werf et al., 2006). \n\nThe oceanic CO 2 flux is taken from CarbonTracker 2011 optimized results, whose a priori estimates are based on two different data sets: namely, the ocean inversion flux result (Jacobson et al., 2007) and pCO 2 -Clim prior estimate derived from the climatology of seawater pCO 2 (Takahashi et al., 2009). \n\nThe fossil fuel combustion estimate is the data set preprocessed by CarbonTracker 2011 from the global total fossil fuel emission of the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center (CDIAC) (Boden et al., 2011) and the Open-source Data Inventory of Anthropogenic CO 2 emission (ODIAC) data set (Oda and Maksyutov, 2011). \n\nAtmospheric transport model\n\nThe global chemical transport Model for OZone And Related chemical Tracers (MOZART; Emmons et al., 2010)  with 28 vertical levels. The forcing meteorology is from the National Center For Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) forecasts (Kalnay et al., 1996;Kistler et al., 2001). Since CO 2 is chemically inert in the atmosphere, we turn off all the chemical processes and leave only transport of CO 2 by atmospheric motions. Given the atmospheric CO 2 concentration in the previous week and the surface carbon fluxes in the current week, MOZART is used to forecast gridded atmospheric CO 2 concentration within the current week. \n\nObservation\n\nThe atmospheric CO 2 concentration measurements collected and preprocessed by Observation Package (ObsPack) data product (Masarie et al., 2014) 1. CO 2 concentration measurements reflect the variability of the total surface carbon fluxes (i.e. fossil fuel combustion, vegetation fire, oceanic uptake and biosphere) as well as inter-exchange among CO 2 air mass in the initial atmosphere. \n\nThe observation error variances are also provided in obspack_co2_1_CARBONTRACKER_CT2013_2014-05-08. They were subjectively chosen and manually tuned to fit into specific atmospheric transport models and observations (Peters et al., 2005(Peters et al., , 2007)). Since these values depend on the atmospheric transport model used in a carbon data assimilation system, they are just used as prior values for this study and will be adaptively adjusted with the proposed assimilation scheme. \n\nMethodology\n\nWithin tth week, let c t be a set of gridded atmospheric CO 2 concentrations every 3 h, f t be the set of prior carbon fluxes every 3 h, and λ t be a set of factors defined as constants on areas and within a week for adjusting f t . Then, the model state is defined as \n\nIn this study, only land surface carbon fluxes need to be adjusted. The partition of the adjustment factors (i.e. λ t ) is based on 11 Transcom regions (Gurney et al., 2004) and 19 Olson ecosystem types, as in CarbonTracker. Thus, the size of the state vector in this study is 128 × 64 × 28 × 8 × 7 (c t : lon × lat × lev × times/day × days) plus 145 (λ t ). We refer to this data assimilation scheme as the Global Carbon Assimilation System based on the ensemble Kalman filter (GCAS-EK). \n\nEnKF with error inflations\n\nUsing the notations of Ide et al. (1997), the first EnKF algorithm used in this study consists of the following three main steps: \n\nwww. \n\nForecast step\n\nThe perturbed forecast states are estimated as \n\nwhere i represents an ensemble member, ξ t,i are vectors sampled from a distribution with mean zero and a given covariance matrix (taken from prior covariance structure in CarbonTracker; see the document of CarbonTracker and Peters et al., 2005Peters et al., , 2007)), and G is the atmospheric transport operator which maps c t−1 and the λ t adjusted f t onto gridded CO 2 concentration. Then the forecast state is estimated as \n\nwhere m is the ensemble size. \n\nError step\n\nThe ensemble forecast errors and the observation error covariance matrix are estimated as √ θ t X f t and µ t R t , respectively, where \n\nand R t is the prescribed observation error covariance matrix. θ t and µ t are the inflation factors of the forecast error and the observation error, respectively, which are estimated by minimizing the objective function (Liang et al., 2012;Zheng, 2009): \n\nwhere y o t is the vector of atmospheric CO 2 concentration measurements, H t is a linear observation operator, which interpolates gridded CO 2 concentrations at observation times and locations. Michalak et al. (2005) used a similar objective function for estimating the statistical parameters in the atmospheric inverse problems of surface fluxes. \n\nAnalysis step\n\nThe perturbed analysis states are estimated as \n\nwhere ε t,i is a normal random variable with mean zero and covariance matrix µ t R t (Burgers et al., 1998). The analysis state x a t is estimated as \n\nx a t,i . \n\nFinally, set t = t +1 and return to the forecast step (1) for the assimilation at next time step. The assimilated surface carbon fluxes are from all sources because the observed CO 2 concentrations arise from all sources. Then, the surface carbon fluxes from the biosphere are estimated by the assimilated total carbon fluxes minus carbon fluxes from other sources supplied by the forcing data. \n\nConstructing error statistics using analysis\n\nLet x t t be the true state. Then the ensemble forecast error should be defined as x f t,i − x t t . However, x t t is estimated by x f t in Eq. ( 4). Since x a t is derived by assimilating observations into the model, it is a better estimate of x t t than x f t , especially when the model error is large (Wu et al., 2013). Therefore, after the analysis step (3) in Sect. 3.1, it is suggested to return to the error step (2), and substitute x f t in Eq. ( 4) by x a t . This procedure is repeated until the corresponding objective function (Eq. 5) converges (Wu et al., 2013;Zheng et al., 2013). In this study, the iteration is stopped when the difference between the minima of −2L t (θ, µ) at nth and n + 1th iterations is less than 1. A flowchart of the proposed assimilation scheme is shown in Fig. 2. Inf refers to the case with inflation on forecast error covariance only, both Inf refers to the case with inflations on both forecast and observation error covariances and iteration refers to the case with both inflations and further using analysis to improve forecast error statistics. The closer χ 2 /n obs is to 1, the better the corresponding error estimates. \n\nRemoving carbon mass imbalance\n\nIn this study, the background CO 2 concentration field at the beginning of a week is the analysis state at the end of the previous week. It is then updated using the observations within the week; therefore, the estimated CO 2 concentration at the beginning of the week is different from that at the end of the previous week. This results in inexact carbon mass balance. To remove this imbalance, a corrected atmospheric CO 2 concentration is generated using the sequential forecast of CO 2 concentration with the optimized carbon fluxes from the very beginning of the entire assimilation period. The corrected CO 2 concentration is denoted by c ca t . \n\nValidation statistics\n\nChi-square statistics (Tarantola, 2005) are used to test the error covariances constructed in this study. For the tth week, it is defined as \n\nwhere \n\nand θ, µ are the estimated inflation factors for the week. \n\nIf the forecast and observation error covariance matrix are correctly estimated, χ 2 2,Iter follows a Chi-square distribution with n obs degrees of freedom, where n obs is the number of observations within tth week. Since the mean and the vari- ance of χ 2 2,Iter /n obs are 1 and 2/n obs , respectively, the value of χ 2 2,Iter /n obs should be close to 1. The Chi-square statistics for the error covariance matrices without using the analysis state can be defined similarly to Eq. ( 8), but with X f t replaced by X f t . They are denoted as χ 2 0 , χ 2 1 and χ 2 2 for the cases of no inflation, inflation on forecast error only and inflation on both forecast and observation errors, respectively. The closer χ 2 j /n obs , j = 0, 1, 2 to 1 is, the better the corresponding error statistics. \n\nThe root mean square error (RMSE) of estimated CO 2 observations is defined as \n\nwhere y ca i (l) is generated by interpolating c ca t to the observation site l and time i, and L is the total number of the CO 2 concentration observations during the entire assimilation period. The smaller RMSE means better assimilation scheme. \n\nDiscussions on methodology\n\nError covariance statistics\n\nTo validate the construction of error statistics used in this study, we plot the weekly time series of χ 2 2,Iter /n obs (Eq. 8) from 2002 to 2003 in Fig. 3, which shows that the values are remarkably close to 1. In contrast, the weekly time series of χ 2 0 /n obs , χ 2 1 /n obs , and χ 2 2 /n obs (for the cases of no inflation, inflation on forecast error only, and inflation on both forecast and observation errors) are not as close to 1 as χ 2 2,Iter /n obs . This indicates that the construction of error statistics using the analysis state iteratively (Sect. 3.2) is effective for correctly estimating the error statistics. Figure 3 also shows that χ 2 2 /n obs is closer to 1 than χ 2 1 /n obs , and both are closer to 1 than χ 2 0 /n obs . This suggests that the inflations on forecast error and observation error are also both effective in improving the estimation of error statistics. \n\nInclusion of CO 2 concentration in state vectors\n\nIn this study, the CO 2 concentration is included in state vectors. The benefit of this inclusion needs to be tested against the traditional approach without this inclusion. This issue is studied with the 1-week assimilation window. \n\nFor this purpose we design a comparative experiment as follows. In every week, the CO 2 concentration (i.e. c) is not updated (Eq. 6). Instead the analysis CO 2 concentration is derived by sequentially predicting atmospheric CO 2 concentration forced by the updated flux within the week. The carbon mass is automatically balanced in this experiment. The results show that RMSE of the analysis CO 2 concentration observations (Eq. 10) is 8.5 % larger than that of the corrected analysis CO 2 concentration described in Sect. 3.3. This suggests that inclusion of CO 2 concentration in state vectors can significantly alter the CO 2 mass balance and may have an advantage in optimizing the surface CO 2 flux. \n\nIf the CO 2 concentration is not included in state vectors, the analysis CO 2 concentration at the beginning of each week is just the analysis CO 2 concentration at the end of the previous week, so the CO 2 concentration observations within the current week are not used to optimize the CO 2 concen-tration at the beginning of each week. However, when the CO 2 concentration is included in state vectors, all the observations within the current week and the previous weeks are used to estimate the CO 2 concentration at the beginning of the current week. So the CO 2 concentration at the beginning of each week estimated by inclusion of CO 2 concentration in state vectors could be more accurate than estimated without inclusion. Therefore, the estimated flux associated with the updated CO 2 concentration at the beginning of the current week should have better quality. This is more clearly demonstrated by smaller RMSE in Eq. ( 10) with the inclusion than that without the inclusion. \n\nLength of assimilation window\n\nDifferent lengths of the assimilation window are used in various systems (5 weeks in CarbonTracker, 3 and 7 days in Miyazaki et al., 2011, and6 h in Kang et al., 2012). We choose the 1-week assimilation window in our methodology for the following reasons. First, since most surface stations only have weekly observations, we need at least 1 week of data to cover the globe. Second, beyond 1 week the errors of the atmospheric transport model may be significant, and they are very difficult to quantify. Third, the detailed information of observations may be attenuated with time by atmospheric diffusion and advection (Enting, 2002). \n\nFor comparison to longer assimilation windows, the following alternative experiments with moving assimilation windows were carried out. In the first alternative experiment, the length of the moving window is set to be 2 weeks while the forecast time step is still 1 week. The CO 2 concentration observation system is still the same as that described in Sect. 3, but is used to update the global carbon flux and the atmospheric CO 2 concentration within the current week and the previous week. This procedure is similar to Eq. ( 6), while the ensemble forecast state of the first week in the assimilation window is set as its ensemble analysis state at previous assimilation time step. Therefore, carbon fluxes and CO 2 concentration every week are optimized twice with the observations in the current week and the next week. The corrected analysis of CO 2 concentration is also retrieved from rerunning the atmospheric transport model as described in Sect. 3.3. The second alternative experiment is similar to the first one, but with the 3-week moving window. \n\nThe linear trends for the observations, the estimates with 1-week, 2-week and 3-week moving windows are 2.14, 2.17, 1.59, and 1.13 ppm yr −1 , respectively. It seems that the longer the moving window is, the larger difference is the long-term growth rate to the measurements. For further investigating the reason, the annual mean carbon budgets on 11 Transcom regions are shown in Fig. 4. It can be found that the longer the moving window is, the larger are the carbon budget adjustments. Long windows result in underestimation of the corresponding long-term growth rate. \n\nTo further investigate the long time and long distance impact of atmospheric transport on CO 2 observations, components of CO 2 concentration at observation sites associated with different Transcom regions in each day before their observation times are calculated in the following way. For a given region and some day before the observation time, prior fluxes on other regions and in other days are all masked. Then the atmospheric transport model can be run with a homogeneous initial atmospheric CO 2 concentration and forced by the masked fluxes to obtain the corresponding CO 2 concentration components. \n\nThese components at individual sites are then averaged in time to investigate general impacts of carbon fluxes from different sources. The results at 7 selected sites are shown in Fig. 5. For these sites, CO 2 concentrations resulting from carbon fluxes within 25 days are mainly from local carbon fluxes within 7 days (although mostly within 3 days). Carbon fluxes beyond seven days or regions far from the observation locations have very small impacts, indicating that they have little information in observations (i.e. the contribution is less than observation error), even if the atmospheric transport model is accurate. Actually majority of observations (approximately 49) over continental sites used in this study have similar properties to these seven sites. If the errors of the transport and ecosystem models are considered, the information of fluxes 1 week before may be even more difficult to estimate. \n\nThe setting of length of the assimilation window is closely related to spatial and temporal localizations of forecast errors. For the observation network and the atmospheric transport model used in this study, the 1-week assimilation window seems most suitable. \n\nApplication and results\n\nIn this section we use the data assimilation methods described in Sect. 3 to estimate the land surface carbon fluxes from 2002 to 2008. \n\nAdjustment to total carbon budget of BEPS\n\nWe first carry out a control run starting from 1 January 2002 with no adjustment of prior fluxes. The simulated CO 2 concentrations are interpolated at observation times and locations, and compared with real observations in the year 2005. The result in Fig. 6 (top) shows that the simulated concentrations have a bias of 2.945 ppm and an RMSE of 4.525 ppm, implying an underestimation of carbon sinks by BEPS. Using GCAS-EK to estimate the ecosystem fluxes, we carry out another control run and comparisons. The bias and RMSE are reduced to 0.967 and 3.675 ppm, respectively (Fig. 6, bottom). \n\nIt is worthwhile to point out that the underestimation of carbon sinks by BEPS is conditioned on the estimated carbon fluxes released by fossil fuel and fire, even if the ocean fluxes used in our assimilation system are accurate. As described in Sect. 2, the observed variability of CO 2 concentration is due to the variability of carbon fluxes from all sources, including fossil fuel combustion, vegetation fire, oceanic uptake, and biosphere exchange. If non-biospheric carbon sources are underestimated, the carbon sinks from the biosphere simulated by BEPS would also be underestimated. Nevertheless, our adjustment to carbon sinks simulated by BEPS appears reasonable. similar, although they are quite different from that of Car-bonTracker 2011. \n\nMultiyear average of the global carbon flux distribution\n\nCarbon budgets are calculated based on the BEPS ecosystem types and the 11 Transcom regions (Fig. 8). Similar to the global distribution maps (Fig. 7), GCAS-EK carbon budgets (Fig. 8) have almost the same property in sources or sinks with that simulated by BEPS. However, they are quite different from that of CarbonTracker 2011 in many aspects. For example, for the C4 and the shrub in Australia, BEPS simulates carbon sources while CarbonTracker 2011 shows carbon sinks. Moreover, in North America, there is a large carbon sink increase of the GCAS-EK over the BEPS simulated. A further diagnostic (not shown here) reveals that, between October and April, the carbon sinks estimated by CarbonTracker 2011 are much larger than that estimated by GCAS-EK. But between May and September, the carbon sinks estimated by CarbonTracker 2011 and GCAS-EK are very close. \n\nInterannual and seasonal variations\n\nThe interannual variations of the global total carbon budgets are shown in Fig. 9. It shows that CarbonTracker 2011 predicts the largest multiyear average carbon sink (−3.89 PgC yr −1 ), compared with the smallest one simulated by BEPS (−2.23 PgC yr −1 ). The assimilated mean carbon sink (−3.87 PgC yr −1 ) is virtually identical to that estimated by CarbonTracker 2011. The carbon sinks simulated by BEPS and predicted by CarbonTracker 2011 obviously have more interannual oscillation than that assimilated by GCAS-EK. The monthly variations of the multiyear-averaged carbon budgets before and after the assimilation of BEPS results are compared with that by CarbonTracker 2011 in Fig. 10. Clearly, the seasonal variability of the carbon budgets by Car-bonTracker 2011 is the largest. The assimilated fluxes based on BEPS have larger sinks in the summer and smaller sources in the winter than those before the assimilation. \n\nComparison to other flux estimations\n\nTwo independent gridded carbon flux estimates are compared with GCAS-EK estimates. \n\nThe first independent data set is net carbon exchange of U.S. terrestrial ecosystems by Xiao et al. (2011) which is generated by integrating eddy covariance flux measurements and satellite observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and is referred to as EC-MOD. The original data set is during 2002 to 2006 with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 8 day. For The carbon budgets estimated by GCAS-EK were also compared to those by Lauvaux et al. (2012), Penn State University (PSU) inversion and Colorado State University (CSU) inversion (Schuh et al., 2013) for the Mid-Continent Intensive (MCI) area from June to December 2007. The spatial patterns by GCAS-EK and CarbonTracker 2011 are similar to those estimated by PSU, CSU (Schuh et al., 2013) and Lauvaux et al. (2012) (not shown here). The regionalaveraged carbon sinks estimated by GCAS-EK and by Car-bonTracker 2011 are 0.19 and 0.26 PgC, respectively, while the averaged carbon sinks estimated by PSU and CSU (Schuh et al., 2013) and by Lauvaux et al. (2012) are between 0.14 and 0.18 PgC, which are closer to that estimated by GCAS-EK than that by CarbonTracker 2011. \n\nSince the true values of carbon flux are unknown, the closeness to the independent gridded carbon flux estimates does not mean a better assimilation. However, these two ex-amples indicate that the carbon fluxes estimated by GCAS-EK may provide some useful new information of global carbon flux estimation to the atmospheric inversion community. Therefore, the development of the new assimilation system is worthwhile. \n\nConclusion\n\nWe propose a methodology to assimilate atmospheric CO 2 concentration into surface carbon fluxes simulated by an ecosystem model. In our framework, CO 2 concentration is included in the state vector, and the assimilation window is restricted to 1 week. Both forecast and observation errors are inflated, and forecast error statistics are estimated in an adaptive procedure using the analysis states. Generally speaking, these adaptive estimations improve the accuracy of assimilated error statistics in EnKF, which leads to further improvement in the accuracy of analysis states. Importantly, pre-assigned values of the observation error variance are improved if these adaptive procedures are applied. \n\nThe application of the methodology to real data shows that the assimilated total carbon budgets by GCAS-EK are comparable to those reported by CarbonTracker 2011. However, there are significant regional differences between carbon flux distributions assimilated by GCAS-EK and CarbonTracker 2011, which may be attributed to the differences between the ecosystem models, atmospheric transport models, or the assimilation methodologies. \n\nIn our future study, we will investigate the sensitivity of assimilation results to the accuracy of ecosystem and transport models. Also, more observation data sets, such as remotesensing CO 2 column data, will be introduced into the GCAS-EK. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n   \n\n\n\n \n",

    "text": "\nBackground\n\nPhysicians play an important role in smoking cessation, and medical advice and pharmacotherapy are effective clinical interventions to prompt and help patients to stop smoking [1][2][3][4]. Brief physician advice is effective for suc-cessful smoking cessation with odds ratio (OR) 1.66 (95% CI 1.42 to 1.94) versus no advice or usual care [1]. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) relative to placebo or non-NRT group is 1.58 (95% CI 1.50 to 1.66) [3]. Bupropion double the odds of cessation (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.72 to 2.19) [4]. Group therapy is also effective (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.37 versus no intervention controls) whereas acupuncture, hypnosis, and autogenic training (relaxation technique with self-hypnosis) have no demonstrated efficacy on smoking cessation [2,[5][6][7]. Self-help material such as brochures on tobacco and health might increase quit rates, but the size of the effect is small. Self-help materials have no additional benefit when used in concert with advice from a healthcare professional or with nicotine replacement therapy [8]. \n\nAround 80% of the Swiss general population visits a doctor annually, and most patients expect smoking cessation interventions from their physician [9][10][11]. Furthermore, studies have found clinical activities related to smoking cessation to be highly cost-effective in developed countries, particularly when compared to other currently accepted preventive activities, such as treating mild to moderate hypertension and lowering cholesterol levels [12]. \n\nHowever, some doctors perceive barriers to engaging in smoking cessation counselling, such as lack of patient interest, lack of confidence in their ability to discuss smoking cessation, lack of time, fear of harming the doctor-patient relationship and difficulty to advice smokers without smoking-related problems [13][14][15][16]. When practitioners are asked to judge the importance of different preventive activities in their clinical practice, 93% judge controlling blood pressure to be \"very important\"; in contrast, only 73% find counselling on smoking cessation to be \"very important\" [13]. \n\nPhysicians' own health habits, like sedentary lifestyle or drinking more than three alcoholic drinks per day, could also negatively influence their attitudes toward smoking cessation counselling (smoking status was not a predictor in this study) [13]. \n\nSurveys of Swiss patients have reported that 81% to 88% of smokers have discussed their smoking habits with a physician, but only 34% were advised to stop [17,18]. \n\nIn 2002, when the survey was conducted, the national program for smoking prevention 2001-2005 has just started (Federal Office of Public Health). An educational program to improve physicians' skills and effectiveness in smoking cessation has been developed and assessed by residents in outpatients clinics few years before [19]. Twenty-five teachers were trained in 2002 in order to disseminate the smoking cessation program nationwide. A reference manual on smoking cessation in clinical practice including algorithms for smokers approach and therapy, as well as patients' brochures were available. There were however hardly any smoking cessation specialists, except in few University hospitals. \n\nWhen the survey took place, smoking cessation post-graduate training sessions were not uniformly implemented throughout Switzerland with linguistic regions difference: there were proportionally more training sessions in French-speaking region than in German part. \n\nThe purpose of this survey was to assess clinical practice of Swiss primary care physicians toward patients motivated to stop smoking. Our ultimate objective was to highlight areas in which tobacco prevention programs should focus their attention in order to enhance delivery of evidencebased clinical practice for promoting smoking cessation. \n\nMethods\n\nData collection\n\nUsing the national registry of the Swiss primary care physicians, we randomly sampled 50% (n = 1872) of the physicians in the German-speaking cantons, and included all of the physicians in the French-speaking (n = 1286) and Italian-speaking (n = 227) regions. An invitation announcing the purpose of the survey and a copy of the questionnaire (with a self-addressed, pre-stamped envelope) were mailed to all 3385 doctors. Non-respondents received a single reminder letter eight weeks later that included a copy of the questionnaire. Data were processed anonymously. \n\nThe questionnaire was developed in French and 18 colleagues in Lausanne, Switzerland, conducted pilot testing. The instrument was professionally translated into German and Italian and checked for accuracy prior to study launch. \n\nStatistical analyses\n\nUnivariate analyses were performed to describe the data. The multivariate model used one set of dichotomous data that combined information about the self-reported use of nine tobacco cessation interventions for smoking patients who wanted to quit, as described below. \n\nFor scoring the smoking cessation practice of physicians, one point was given for each positive answer about using the following evidence-based interventions: (a) prescription of nicotine replacement therapy, (b) prescription of bupropion, (c) direct smoking cessation counselling, (d) recommendation to attend group smoking cessation therapy, and (e) referral to a smoking cessation specialist for counselling. No points were added or deducted for the reported use of (a) acupuncture, (b) hypnosis, (c) relaxation techniques, or (d) written self-help material. Possible scores ranged from 0 to +5. We predefined a dichotomous variable indicating a score ≥ 2, to be interpreted as an indicator of good physician practice. \n\nA multivariable logistic analysis was performed to identify factors favouring good physician practice. The following variables were considered: previously attending smoking cessation training, years since graduation (defined as ≤ 20 years versus > 20 years), urban residence, and smoking status (defined as daily smoker versus non-smoker including ex-smoker and occasional smoker). For this analysis, data were weighted according to the sample size. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). \n\nResults\n\nSample characteristics\n\n1856 physicians, for a response rate of 54.8%, returned the questionnaires. The response rates were 54.5%, 54.8%, and 57.7% for German-, French-, and Italianspeaking doctors, respectively (p = 0.654). \n\nRespondents were predominately 40 years of age or older (88%), male (79%), and practiced in urban areas (74%). Over half of the sample came from the German-speaking area, a third from French-speaking regions, and less than a tenth of respondents were Swiss-Italian. The majority of respondents graduated between 11 and 30 years before to the survey, 5% within the last 10 years of the survey, and 12% over 30 years before the survey. Only 5% of physicians had received training on smoking cessation counselling with significant linguistic difference (German:1.5%, French: 10.5%, Italian: 3.2%, p < 0.001). Slightly over one-sixth reported being current daily or occasional smokers (Table 1). \n\nRegarding physicians' choice of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions, the majority reported prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (84%), bupropion (65%), or providing an individual consultation to patients on their tobacco use (70%). About one-third reported recommending participation in a smoking cessation group, and one-tenth referred smokers to a smoking cessation clinic (Table 2). \n\nRegarding the unproven techniques, one-fourth of physicians recommended acupuncture and under one-tenth proposed hypnosis or relaxation techniques. Nearly, onefourth provided brochures on the topic. \n\nUsing the formulas described in the Methods section, 85% of physicians (n = 1581) had a \"good\" score on tobacco cessation practices (Figure 1). \n\nPredictors of clinical tobacco cessation practices\n\nOur model for predicting characteristics of physicians with a \"good\" clinical practice score included having received smoking cessation training, having received their medical diploma more than 20 years prior to the survey, practicing in an urban environment, and personal smoking status. The language region (French, German, or Italian) was not included in the model because of its interaction with the availability of smoking cessation Having received smoking cessation training was the only statistically significant predictor of a \"good\" clinical practice score (Table 3). \n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results of this survey suggest that the majority of Swiss primary care physicians practice evidence-based smoking cessation interventions. A large majority of these physicians reported prescribing first-line therapies including nicotine substitutes and bupropion, as well as providing individual counselling on how to quit using tobacco. Only a small minority reported recommending attending a smoking cessation group or referring smokers to tobacco specialists. \n\nThe only characteristic positively associated with a good practice score on smoking cessation intervention was hav-ing attended smoking cessation training. Physicians' own smoking status was not significantly correlated with smoking cessation practices, as has been reported in other studies; however, an association between personal health behaviour and attitude toward health promotion has been reported [13,20,21]. The interval since physicians received their medical diplomas and whether or not they practiced in an urban environment were not significantly correlated with tobacco cessation interventions. \n\nInternational studies have assessed physicians' incorporation of tobacco control interventions in their clinical practice and their opinions about national guidelines [22][23][24][25]. However, it was not possible to compare Swiss physician practices with this data because the questions in the surveys and the health systems are not similar. \n\nOur study had some limitations. Firstly, our response rate (55%) led us to question whether there was potential bias. However, this participation rate is in concordance with rates reported in other physician surveys [21][22][23]. Furthermore, response bias might not pose as much of a methodological challenge in this relatively homogenous population in terms of age and gender as compared to the general physician population, except the slight smaller proportion of respondents who were daily smokers, 7% versus 12% reported in a previous survey [26]. Secondly, respondents were perhaps more motivated in this topic, that could have resulted in overestimation of the quality of the smoking cessations interventions. A third limitation was using the score variables to combine responses to multiple survey questions. These unvalidated measures could have led to bias in the regression analyses. Giving equal weighting to the interventions is an approximate way to establish the score, as recommending counselling is probably a weaker intervention than direct counselling. \n\nJust self-reported attitude, no measure of frequency, no measure of whether physicians assessed smoking status and non-uniformly implementation of smoking cessation  We think there are important policy implications in improving the practice scores among physicians who had or had not previously taken a smoking cessation course. Although this survey did not measure clinical outcomes in patients, we assumed that patients being followed by physicians with better smoking cessation practice scores would have higher quit rates. Therefore, our data provide impetus for promoting more smoking cessation training courses for physicians. Further evidence of the benefits of training physicians can be found in a prior randomized controlled trial among physicians, in which patients assigned to doctors who received smoking cessation training had improved smoking-related behavioural and clinical outcomes [27]. \n\nSince this survey was conducted in 2002, the Swiss national program for tobacco prevention published clinical recommendations and organized smoking cessation training courses for physicians [28][29][30][31]. More than 4000 Swiss physicians have provided teaching assistance. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe majority of participating Swiss physicians practice recommended smoking cessation interventions with patients motivated to stop smoking. However, the number of physicians practicing these interventions could be increased and implementation of the interventions could be improved; smoking cessation training courses are an effective means of achieving both goals. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n",

Production planning combines and coordinates all the manufacturing activities; it broadly consists of three componentsplanning, controlling and dispatching. The planning process refers to the pre-manufacturing task of the objectives and targets with respect to the available resources and constraints. Control refers to the continuous evaluation of the performance, according to the standards set by planning. Hence, the aim of production control is to make sure that the consignment is produced at the optimum quality, time and quantity with cost-effective methods. In Production Planning, Scheduling refers to the part of planning which is concerned with the schedule of an activity; the start time and the finish time. This paper aims to develop a robust scheduling strategy to improve the scheduling aspect of production planning. \n\nThe main reason, the scheduling of a consignment is inconsistent or deviates from the standard behaviour is due to various non-deterministic reasons such as human operator error, machine faults, delays in supply etc. The current planning algorithms do not capture these intrinsic non-deterministic uncertainties which result in poor performance during execution. This leads to losses in capital, time and resources. The method discussed in this paper is influenced by this problem. These uncertainties are more accurately quantified to develop an improved robust scheduling strategy. \n\nThis paper provides a general outline to more realistically quantify operational non-deterministic uncertainty which is conventionally different from the general practices currently employed in the industry.The general practices assume it to be a deterministic system, which leads to such faulty predictions [1]. It introduces the uncertainty models used-P-box and epsilon-contamination models, briefly describe the Industrial data set and explain how to model on such data. A numerical example is introduced for a specific case which would enhance the understandability of the project. \n\nCurrent Literature\n\nDuring the last years, a lot of academic research has focused on the topic of production planning and scheduling. The authors [2] attribute the operational uncertainty to software that are fixated on ideal schedules. They suggest human operator intervention from the production planner to the task scheduler-depending on the frequency and severity of scheduling errors. These respondents are responsible for rescheduling and identifying the optimal path of action. This method relies on human intervention to counter the planning faults due to non-deterministic uncertainty. However, this is only applicable to small production plants and does not factor in the human operator errors. \n\nThe authors [3] have focused on reviewing methods to scheduling under uncertainty including robust, stochastic and fuzzy scheduling. They propose a baseline schedule which is planned before the manufacturing operation. Reactive scheduling re-optimizes this schedule dynamically according to the uncertainties. Hence it depends on a stochastic assessment of the uncertainty, from which a set of decisions are developed. \n\nUncertainty Modelling\n\nGenerally, in such systems, the uncertainty is either quantified as probabilistic [4] or fuzzy set models [5]. Typically, stochastic methods are used with a combination of different probability distribution models to represent various phenomenons. These models are however unrealistic due to the fact that interval-based uncertainties are not possible to quantify/model with fixed parameter probability distributions. They fail to take into account the variations in uncertainty such as the variation in any initial probability distributions such as median value shifts. Such models are also very complex to build and require field experts to define and generate. As shown by [5], classic probabilistic models fail to capture the whole non-deterministic nature of uncertainties in manufacturing processes. After analysis of a large Industrial data set, it was concluded that probability box models are much more accurate for manufacturing plants. Epsilon contamination is a method to capture uncertainty through e-contamination classes. It is a bayesian method, which is used in data sets which has corrupted, incomplete or insufficient data. It is used in Robust statistics and the methodology discusses uses this as one of its components. \n\nProbability box\n\nA P-box or a probability box is the area circumscribed within an upper and lower cumulative distribution function to characterize an imprecise distribution. The most significant benefit of a p-box is that it captures this non-deterministic uncertainty within a confined group very well in juxtaposition to Probability distribution functions themselves. For a more extensive data set, set are divided into a subset, and PDFs are computed, then PDFs are integrated to construct a bounded set of CDF. The non-deterministic likelihood of the technique or parameters affected by this new unpredictable change is represented by this set of CDFs. \n\nA Cumulative Frequency distribution represents the cumulative probability of a random variable from negative infinity up to a random variable X. By definition, F is a non-decreasing function with a range of [0, 1] over the domain of \n\nAs a function of unexplained unpredictable disturbances to specific techniques or parameters, p-boxes are a valuable method for catching non-deterministic uncertainties. Let's consider a particular task performed by 2 workers, and the time taken to complete the job is recorded for a year. Using the data, respective PDFs and CDFs are plotted. Then from the resulting CDFs, it is computed that which worker works better than others for the particular task. But the result did not account for the non-deterministic uncertainty parameters such as mood or the worker's distractions. It may be possible that these uncertainties affect the worker timing and due to which one CDF has a higher variation than others. To capture these non-deterministic uncertainties, the p-box is the most suitable tool. To plot the p-box data set is divided into subsets; upper and lower bounded CDFs are plotted. P-box captures the uncertainty in the probability of duration task completion. This enables the system for more robust task assignments for any future event accommodating non-deterministic delays. \n\nEpsilon Contamination\n\nThe epsilon contamination model \n\nIn this model [7], the probability epsilon ( ) donates the probability that the data set is contaminated by a distribution Q. Let P be the distribution of the sequence i.e. a function of the measures of central tendency. This model provided by Huber proposes a robust statistical framework by establishing priors. It is a convex combination of two distinct uncertainty models-1. Vacuous Model and 2. Probabilistic model. Epsilon, is a parameter assigned to the trust on the model. \n\nBoth of these models rely on the principle of imprecise belief by [6], the intervals of the p-box and epsilon contamination models quantify uncertainty accurately and should be incorporated in the scheduling algorithms. This belief can be attributed to an operators experience and his expertise in a particular task, i.e. assigning a particular factor to replicate the belief of the process. In this paper, the specific distributions used are cumulative distribution functions. \n\nModelling on Industrial Data set\n\nThis section will explain how to model a particular industrial process through the uncertainty models and how to interpret the model to achieve a more accurate scheduling and robust planning autonomous framework. The modelling technique is divided into two parts-For data with limited information and for complete data. In this numerical case, a critical point of n=25 samples is taken. For the incomplete data set, the epsilon-contamination model is applied with a belief measure. P-boxes are applied on the complete data sets as they have restricted bounds due to the complete information. The database obtained from the industry needs to be pre-processed before entering into this tool if it is unstructured. As the main objective of this research is to optimize the scheduling. In our example, The attributes of the database which exist for operation time, operator ID, task Sequence and Operator skill are taken. Any similar attributes pointing to similar sets of attributes should be identified and taken according to different Industries. For each task undertook in the industry, various operational parameters are considered. Every sequence, operator and season corresponding to a particular task. For every season, cumulative distribution functions of every operator executing a task is plotted. The error times are calculated for every operator in the different operations and season timings. For the second case, for lesser data points or the operators who are on a temporary basis or have limited responsibilities. Epsilon contamination is a very new research topic which focuses on a small region and generalizes for the whole range. The trust factor is taken as 0.8. In the given example, seqID 787 is taken which had only three operators working on this sequence and only 9 observations. To capture the non-determinism in this data, epsilon contamination samples the distribution to form upper and lower previsions according to a trust factor . \n\nThe upper and lower previsions are calculated using this formula and their difference denotes the degree of uncertainty in the data. In this formula, the trust factor is denoted by epsilon, which is assigned by an Industry expert/supervisor on the probability of the task being completed in time. \n\nThe contaminated model means the lower and upper previsions are calculated from the average distribution of the operators in a sequence with an individual distribution contaminant. \n\nAnd the predicted estimated time according to the new model is \n\nTo give an insight, in the paper [3], a Rational Quadratic Gaussian method Regression Model was chosen when a lot of models were analyzed on this knowledge, the model was trained stochastically on the past estimated and real production times to estimate the assembly time with decreased error. \n\nThe training data is used for an year of operation with the exception of operators who have very less data points. The model is explained as follows- \n\nThe model has to be suited to different data sets. The numerical example have employed this with parameters b = 7.734x10 3 with a = 4.43x10 3 . The result section compares the recomputed p-box which shows that this learning model improved the prediction times are reduced the error times by an appreciable margin. The final step is consolidating all these features into an easy-to-use GUI. This will increase the usability of the research results and will lead to wider adaptability to different industries. An application can be developed via MATLAB or python to incorporate all such modelling techniques suggested in this paper and link it with a regression learner to automate the whole process. The best operator suggestion is made by calculating the degree of uncertainty i.e. the difference of the upper and lower previsions. The predicted time of completion of operation is also shown using the new developed model. The results achieved through the adoption of this process by the facility are very substantial. The industry has reported more accurate prediction times and have helped in estimating the delivery time for different operations. After, the machine learning process the P-boxes are again computed which highlight that the error times are reduced. A reduction is e.g., observed from Original = 0.15 units to TrainedModel = 0.7 for the same operation as per normalised area. As the area under the pox-describe the variance in the error values, this shows that the predicted times are now closer to the actual times observed. This research has also helped to rank the employees on their performance and create a new assignment schedule for different operations and operators according to different seasons. \n\nResults\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, this article provides a new perspective to data optimization of Industry 4.0. This article bridges the gap between pure mathematics and application and proposes a novel applied mathematics approach to quantify non-deterministic uncertainty. General practices assume determinism which is an inherent flaw in the procedure and this paper proposes a dynamic approach to solve this problem. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n           \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n",

These include all fields of its follower's lives like moral, social and even economic aspects. Religion does not only teach and guides in spiritual matters but it also illuminates the way to economic growth and outputs for its people. \n\nEntrepreneurial motivation has been researched tremendously and it suggests that entrepreneurial behaviour responds to a variety of social factors as well as to the religion. That's why entrepreneurs are clearly woven by and highly affected by their socio cultural environment. Current study is primarily focused on economic behaviour of individuals and particularly entrepreneurial intentions are of major concerns in this study. To cut it short the study is aimed to test whether or not religiosity has an effect on entrepreneurial intentions. Preliminary work has been done to answer this question. All those studies used and implemented different scales or variables. \n\nIn the field of social sciences, the study of religion and specially the economic aspect is rather a new phenomenon. But there are some who claim that Weber's the Protestant ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism, in 1905 was the first to identify economic role of faith. As argued by Lannaccone (1998) Adam smith was the first who started modern study of economics of religion. Investigation of Anderson (1988) is about the aspects of wealth of nation in which the economics of religion is highlighted. Whatever the case may be it is a fact that importance of religion as an informal institution in various aspects of human life has been attracting the attention of economists. Due to this increase in research in examining the economic function of the religion a new trend has arisen in quantitative studies. \n\nEach society has its own code of Value System according to which the individual of that society live and this is an agreed upon behaviour of that society and held at high esteem. Therefore, business value formation is also influenced by socio-cultural and personal back ground factors. Among these factors are age, ethnicity, religion as well as education of the individual (Alwis and Senathiraja, 2003;Isa and Shitu, 2015). So in a society moulding of an entrepreneur is found to be deeply rooted in the socio-cultural environmental factors of that society. Every religion has a specific role of its value system in determining whether or not an individual can become an entrepreneur. As well as social institutions may also affect the way an individual perceives the role of being an entrepreneur and the extent to which an individual desires to be an entrepreneur. Now days, entrepreneurship is recognised overwhelmingly as a primary engine of economic growth and development. Therefore entrepreneurs' role is becoming very important to the dynamics of a society. For they are the one who combine existing resources with innovative ideas to create new economic goods and services resulting in creating new jobs. To cut short, entrepreneurs are now a link between the new ideas and economic growth and development. With regard to the current study the question is, whether the religious practices of the people affect their entrepreneurial intentions? Is there any link between the level of religiosity and entrepreneurial activities? \n\nIn the following section we will describe the concept of entrepreneurial intentions and its relationship with religiosity, followed by the Islamic perspective on entrepreneurship and theoretical arguments on the relationship between religion and entrepreneurial intentions. \n\nEntrepreneurial intention\n\nIntention has propensity to predict the individual behavior and action is the outcome behavior. (Krueger, 1993). Thus, intention linked to the entrepreneurial activities has been proven to be the predictor of entrepreneurial behavior (Reynolds, 1995). Autio et al. (2001) proposed that intentions can explain about 30% variance in behavior. Therefore, studying the entrepreneurial intention has attracted the interest of many researchers which results many model and theories linked to the explanation of what governs the individuals to engage in entrepreneurship. \n\nThe knowledge of Entrepreneurial intentions provide an insight to scholars ,relating to what triggers opportunity scanning, sources of ideas for business venture and how the new venture idea could actually be transformed into reality (Krueger et al., 2000). Moreover, how the exploitation of discovered opportunities could be carried out successfully with minimum risks (Fini et al., 2009). The study of entrepreneurial intentions is a mean through which entrepreneurship research is advanced and facilitates to understand entrepreneurial activities being different from strategic management (Isa and Shitu, 2015). \n\nReligion and entrepreneurial Intentions\n\nThe studies in the field of, economics of religion gives consensus that religion affects economic performance but the impact happens through different channels which are essence of religious teaching and principles. Anderson (1988) with reference to Adam's theory of moral sentiments points out that religious beliefs provide strong incentives to follow moral restrains such as trust, honesty, benevolence and restraints from violence that have affects on civil society. Iannaccone (1995) points out that all religions work to instil certain values, morals and behavioural frameworks in their followers and those values, morals and beliefs are recognised in almost all aspects of human behaviour. Anderson (1988) points out another similar argument that belief or fear of god leads adherents to abide by \"a kind of internal moral enforcement mechanism\". \n\nEntrepreneurship has no specific religion or culture for it cuts across all religions and also exists in diverse socio-cultural contexts, each of which represents a symbol of global entrepreneurial behaviour (Valliere, 2008). No doubt religion affects certain personal values like honesty, perseverance , bravery foresightedness and general standards positively (Altimay and Wang, 2011). Religion is one of the factors that determine the basic values and beliefs of people (Bwisa and Ndolo, 2011). Therefore, religion is vital in determining the extent to which the individuals take entrepreneurship as a career or not (Garba et al., 2013;Isa and Shitu, 2015). Audretsch et al. (2007) showed that religion influences entrepreneurial participation in their empirical paper. Mainstream Indian religions were compared in their study. It was found that there is a difference between religions according to entrepreneurial participation rate and the decision to become an entrepreneur. A big difference was found among various religions after investigating over 87000 people in India. More participation in entrepreneurship is shown by Christians and Jainism as compared to Buddhist and Hindus. The underlying reasons are suggested but not explained. As, not all the religions are mentioned in the study, therefore a difference between India and other countries can be expected according to these findings. As mentioned earlier the economic status may affect the role of entrepreneurship since there is a difference in per capita income (Van Stel et al., 2005). \n\nOne can look into the association between religion and level of entrepreneurial activity from different angles. Religious factors and entrepreneurship, both are aggregated in this paper for the individual level analysis. Therefore the theoretical reasoning behind the empirical study is based on individual behaviour analysis. \n\nAs discussed in previous sections, religions provide moral and ethical foundations for their adherents encouraging them to behave in a specific way. So the economic behaviour might be directly affected by the impact on traits and attitudes and indirectly by influencing factors which themselves influence economic outcomes. Through institutional sources, religion may also influence economic results. Public commitment to a religious organization, attending religious services signal the acceptance of religious code of conduct. This creates incentives among possible transaction partners to use religion as a signal for specific characteristics of a person and teaching of religion as second under the influence of the socio-religious network of which they are a part themselves. \n\nAdherence to religion and its practices, according to Nikolova and Simroth (2013), often expose followers to new behavioural pattern which alters all their life style in its ramifications. Furthermore as stated by Barro and McCleary (2003) economic growth is highly influenced by the religion from the angles of beliefs, practices, governmental influences etc. Religious influence on societal and political events often tends to be long term continually affecting general entrepreneurial activities (Williamson et al., 2007). \n\nSimilar association between entrepreneurship and religion was also found by Dodd and Gotsis (2007). This association is to be very context specific as it lines with the already reported findings of Sternberg and Wennekers (2005). They stated that economic situation may influence the role of entrepreneurship. That's the reason that relation between entrepreneurship and religion is different over time subject to the economic situation and social settings influenced by other socio-cultural variables like political structures, ideologies and religious symbolism at work. (Dodd and Gotsis, 2007) concluded that individual elements influence the decision to become an entrepreneur. According to their findings if religious salience is high, entrepreneur would tend to use more religious arguments in their decisions for entrepreneurship, even when the decision has the negative influence on their commercial interest. \n\nTheoretical argument\n\nThe study of religion in the realm of social sciences, particularly economics, is relatively a new phenomenon. However some claim Weber\"s the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in 1905, was the first to identify economic role of faith. Although the theory draws its clues mainly from Protestant religion, but it concurs in general agreement that religiosity breeds entrepreneurial mindset and ultimately the risk takers. In this theory religion is the driving force of entrepreneurship. Theory further explains that entrepreneurs become the role performers in line with the expectations of the society; such expectations are purely the product of their religious beliefs, taboos and customs. Religion is pointed out by the theory as a major catalyst of entrepreneurship and emphasizes on the spirit of capitalism which entails economic freedom and enterprise in societies (Weber, 1930). Bwisa and Ndolo (2011) stated that Weber acclaimed that religion encourages all traits that translate into entrepreneurial activities. Moreover religious values build the need for achievement in individuals based on the premise that a person's life is measured by his end result. This means that whatever a person does in life finally calculates as part of his positive or negative scores depending on the outcomes of the decisions taken (Weber, 1930). \n\nReligion is one of the main components of the society and it is proven historically that most religions have positive influence towards entrepreneurship. This is evident in most of the globally accepted religions through their doctrines and ethics of spirituality, where adherents are motivated towards working hard to earn a means of survival (Deutschamann, 2001;Lunn and Klay, 2003). \n\nReligion is the bedrock of success in entrepreneurship as believed and described by the Protestant Ethics and spirit of Capitalism. Motivation injected by the religion into the individual often results in success in entrepreneurship. Religion convincingly drives individual into entrepreneurial activities. Because religion preaches hard work and steadfastness in doing right; desire to earn more, the power of wealth acquisition (Isa and Shitu, 2015). Most religious traditions, in one or the other way address the interplay between entrepreneurship and religion (Weber, 1930). Need for achievement appears to have a strong connection with religion and could eventually breed entrepreneurial intentions (Isa and Shitu, 2015;Saffu, 2003). \n\nIn conclusion, theory high lights the fact that religion ignites some characteristics in individuals that propels them to desire to achieve more and as such become inquisitive, goal driven and achievement oriented. In this way they become much better individuals compared to what they were before in their sphere of life and these attributes are the clear distinction between an entrepreneurial mind person and non-entrepreneurial minded person (Garvey, 2003;Isa and Shitu, 2015;Lunn and Klay, 2003). \n\nMethodology\n\nThis study is a replication of (Isa and Shitu, 2015), they conducted their research in African culture which is quite different from the Asian especially Pakistani culture in a number of aspects, therefore, it is imperative to re-conduct the study in a different setting to validate the results for generalization of findings. \n\nInstrument\n\nA structured questionnaire was developed by adopting item from already validated measures, For measuring religiosity we utilized (Mokhlis, 2008) and for measuring entrepreneurial intentions we utilized Leong (2008). Five likert scale point was used to measure the responses. The sample of this study was the students of business education in the private sector universities located in Lahore, Pakistan. A total number of 500 questionnaires were distributed among the final year students of the management sciences department of the targeted universities. \n\nAnalysis\n\nThe current study utilized Structural Equation modelling. The research utilized the partial least square (PLS-SEM) tool for the assessments of measurement and structural model. SmartPLS2.0 software (Hair et al., 2014) was used to execute the PLS-SEM analyses. \n\nEvaluation of the model by SmartPLS involves two steps, in the first step internal consistency reliability, convergent validity model is assessed. According to Höck and Ringle (2006), the accepted value for composite reliability is the greater value of 0.6. From Table 1, we can see that minimum value of 0.6 is achieved which means internal consistency is established. To determine the convergent validity, average variance extracted (AVE) was applied in this study to show the average communality for each latent variable. The accepted value of AVE is greater than 0.5 in an adequate model (Höck and Ringle, 2006). The results in Table 1 show that AVE is also established. From the Table 1, we can see that all the threshold values were achieved. \n\nR squared\n\nThe R squared value depicts the predictive capability of the model.R 2 value for the endogenous constructs (EI) is found as 0.35 \n\nHypothesis testing\n\nThe relationship of structural model is determined by the path coefficient among the construct of the study (Hair et al., 2014). Critical values for two tailed and one tailed are 1.96 and 1.65 respectively. By the use of bootstrapping function of SmartPLS 2 we calculated the t statistics with 5000 re-sampling as suggested by Hair et al. (2014). Table 2 shows the T statistics of the respective hypothesis and the decision taken on the basis of t statistics. \n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n\nReligion is a key factor shaping personality of individuals. Religion is the one factor that often determines the social action of individuals. Also, religion defines many of the everyday habits of believers. Therefore religion affects the economic activity of individuals too. A key finding of this research is the direct connection of religion with entrepreneurial intentions. \n\nSimply, it means that more religious an individual is, more likelihood that individual may embrace the entrepreneurship. Because once religion is embraced and its virtues are upheld, it overhauls the mindset of the individual. Therefore this result is a true reflection of what is practically obtainable in the society under study. The results of this study has endorsed the findings of previous researchers such as (Garba et al., 2013;Isa and Shitu, 2015) Islam is the main religion of people of Pakistan and the main teachings of Islam as postulates by Solaiman and Hillaly (1997) such as faithfulness, perseverance, hard work, focus, foresight etc. are the attributes of entrepreneurs. There are similarities between the teachings of Islam and entrepreneurship. The former guides towards striving to survive through hard work, perseverance, foresight and independence (self-employment) in order to earn a living ( create wealth) rather than lean on others (salary, jobs), the later labels the aforementioned qualities as what make up an entrepreneur (Azim, 2008;Isa and Shitu, 2015). As a matter of fact, doing business or entrepreneurship is part of Islamic culture (Vargas Hernandez et al., 2010). \n\nStudents are future leader and entrepreneurs who should be taken as an asset of the society, therefore, they must be provided with opportunities as well as encouragement from all walks of life particularly from religious angle to take entrepreneurship as career. Ultimately, this could result in an entrepreneurial economy, which is the dire need of many economies, such as Pakistan. Government should consult the Islamic scholars and religious leaders to consolidate an entrepreneurial model; this could help in promoting the entrepreneurship which will ultimately help in poverty alleviation. \n\nRecommendations for future research\n\nThis study focused on direct association between religiosity and entrepreneurial intentions and ignored the effects of culture; therefore it is strongly recommended that future researches should incorporate cultural as another factor. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n",

    "text": "\nReceptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) 3 is a transmembrane, multiligand receptor expressed by most cells but is characterized by its up-regulation in a range of inflammatory disease states including diabetes, various cancers, and cardiovascular disease (1). RAGE activation through ligand binding transduces intracellular signaling and in turn induces cell migration, invasion, and adhesion (1). Work from multiple groups has demonstrated using rodent models that blocking RAGE signaling impairs the development of numerous pathologic states and therefore highlights RAGE as an attractive ther-apeutic target (2)(3)(4)(5). The most widely used means for blocking RAGE signaling is with soluble RAGE (sRAGE), the recombinantly produced extracellular domain of RAGE. Soluble RAGE acts as a decoy receptor and therefore neutralizes RAGE ligands (2,6). Endogenous sRAGE isoforms, which have been identified in human and mouse sera, are generated through two distinct biological mechanisms: the alternative splicing of the transmembrane region of RAGE leading to a secreted isoform (esRAGE/RAGEv1) and the cleavage of extracellular domain (ectodomain or ECD) at the cell surface by ectodomain shedding (1,(7)(8)(9)(10). Ectodomain shedding is a tightly regulated process and is mediated by various metalloproteinases (11,12). Shedding is essential for normal physiological function but can be deregulated in various pathological disorders where altered levels of metalloproteinases are found (11,12). In fact, many transmembrane proteins are known to undergo ectodomain shedding including cell adhesion molecules, ligands for growth factor receptors, immunoglobulins, and various enzymes (10 -13). Ectodomain shedding of cell surface receptors can affect a number of processes: the loss of cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, the production of a soluble ectodomain that acts as a agonist/antagonist for the cell surface protein, and the release of the intracellular domain (ICD) of the receptor to induce cell signaling ( 10 -13). For RAGE, it has been proposed that shedding acts to release the soluble ECD, which in turn acts as an inhibitor of RAGE signaling through sequestering RAGE ligand from binding cell surface intact RAGE. RAGE shedding is dependent on ADAM10 activity and can be induced with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophores in a PKC␣/␤1-dependent manner (8 -10). The importance of RAGE shedding is underscored by clinical cohort studies that show serum sRAGE levels are correlated with clinical disease states including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and various inflammatory disease states ( 14 -19). Although a few studies have explored the regulation of RAGE ectodomain shedding (8 -10), no studies to date have investigated the biological function of RAGE ectodomain shedding. \n\nIn the current study, we investigated in depth the regulation of RAGE ectodomain shedding and for the first time investigated the impact RAGE ectodomain shedding has on cellular signaling and function. Our data identify RAGE ectodomain shedding as an integral part of its function and a target for designing novel therapeutics for use in RAGE-associated pathologic states. \n\nExperimental Procedures\n\nGeneration of Stable Cell Lines-  and C6 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used to generate cells stably expressing human RAGE (Gen-Bank TM accession number AY755619), mouse RAGE (Gen-Bank accession number EU520325), mouse RAGEv4 (GenBank accession number EU570243), and empty vector (mock) by transfection with FuGENE 6 (Promega) and antibiotic selection with G418 or Zeocin as described previously for RAGE and its splice variants (7,20). Stable expression was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-RAGE polyclonal antibodies as described below. An N-terminal His-tagged RAGE construct was provided by Dr. Nam-Ho Huh (21) that was previously engineered to express a His 6 -2HA tag in between the N-terminal signal sequence and the rest of the RAGE cDNA. Cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) along with penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and MycoZap (Lonza) antibiotics. All cell counting was performed using a Countess automated cell counter (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. \n\nEctodomain Shedding Assays-Stably transfected HEK-293 cells (293-RAGE, 293-mRAGE, 293-mRAGE splice variant 4 (mRAGEv4), and 293-mock empty vector-transfected) were seeded at 2.5 ϫ 10 5 cells/well on poly-D-lysine-coated 6-well plates and grown for 2 days until 70 -80% confluence was reached. The cells were then serum-starved overnight (0.5% FBS in DMEM) and the following day incubated for 1 h with fresh serum-free DMEM prior to experiments. All medium changes were performed with a sterile 1ϫ PBS rinse. Shedding assays were performed in 2 ml of serum-free DMEM with or without shedding compounds for a period of 1 h. In experiments using inhibitors of proteinases or signaling pathways, cells were preincubated with compound for 1 h prior to shedding assays to allow uptake into cells. The cell medium was then removed, and fresh medium containing inhibitor and shedding stimulator was added as above for 1 h. \n\nAfter shedding assays were completed, conditioned medium was removed from cells and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm to remove cell debris. Cell lysate was processed as described below for Western blotting. Shedding inducers used included PMA, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), ionomycin, cantharidin, calyculin A, and sodium pervanadate (all obtained from Sigma). Pervanadate was freshly prepared for each experiment by mixing 100 mM hydrogen peroxide and 100 mM sodium orthovanadate, pH 10, at 1:1 as described previously (22). RAGE ligands used for shedding assays included CMLhuman serum albumin (prepared as we have described previously (3)) and s100B (Calbiochem). Inhibitors used included BB94 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Gö6976 (Millipore), GFX109203X (Millipore), SB203580 (Sigma), SP600125 (Sigma), U0126 (Cell Signaling Technology), LY-294002 (Sigma), and GI254023X (Tocris). EGTA was obtained from Sigma and prepared in water. \n\nWestern Blotting Analysis-Cell lysate was collected immediately after experiments by rinsing in ice-cold PBS followed by lysis with Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (MPER) (Thermo Scientific) containing protease (Sigma) and phospha-tase inhibitors (Sigma) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Conditioned medium for Western blotting was concentrated by cold acetone precipitation at Ϫ20 °C for 2 h followed by centrifugation at 16,000 ϫ g for 10 min and resuspension of protein pellet in Western blotting sample buffer (Invitrogen). Protein concentration in cell lysate was determined by the Bradford assay (Pierce), and lysates were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (23). Antibodies used were as follows: human RAGE monoclonal antibody (Millipore; MAB5328), RAGE polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; H300), ␤-actin (Millipore; MAB1501), and anti-HisG (Invitrogen; R940-25). \n\nsRAGE ELISA-Soluble RAGE levels were measured in whole conditioned medium by ELISAs using the respective human and mouse RAGE DuoSet kits (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ELISA microplates (R&D Systems; DY990) were coated overnight at room temperature with capture antibody in PBS. Plates were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with Reagent Diluent 2 (R&D Systems) before incubation of samples for 2 h at room temperature. RAGE detection was performed using a RAGE streptavidin-labeled antibody diluted and incubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by streptavidin-HRP (R&D Systems) binding. ELISA plates were extensively washed between all incubations with a PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 solution. For detection, 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution (Thermo Scientific) was added before quenching with 2 N H 2 SO 4 (Sigma). ELISA plates were measured using a Bio-Rad iMark 1.04.02 at 450 nm subtracting from 595 nm background. To quantitate RAGE levels in conditioned media, each ELISA experiment contained a human or mouse RAGE standard as provided with the kit. Data were analyzed using Microplate Manager Version 6.1. \n\nCell Migration Assays-For functional cell assays, the C6 cell line, which is an established model for RAGE signaling and cell function (3,4,24), was used. Cell migration assays were performed using C6-mRAGE-, C6-mRAGEv4-, and C6-mocktransfected cells with transwell migration chambers as described previously (4). 5 ϫ 10 3 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of 8-m porous transwell inserts (ThinCerts, Greiner) in serum-free DMEM and incubated in 24-well plates with 5 g/ml S100B or 1% FBS used as a chemoattractant for 24 h. For collagen I, transwell inserts were coated with 10 g/ml for 1 h at 37 °C before use in migration assays. For experiments involving inhibitors, these were added to the upper and lower chambers of transwell experiments (U0126, 10 M; LY-294002, 10 M; GI254023X, 5 M; DAPT, 10 M; BB94, 10 M; sRAGE (R&D Systems), 5 g/ml). Following incubation, cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min and stained with 2% crystal violet in 2% ethanol solution. Non-migrated cells were removed from transwell chambers with a cotton swab. To quantify the cells, the cell stain was extracted with 10% acetic acid, transferred to a 96-well plate, and measured at 595 nm using an iMark microplate reader. \n\nCell Adhesion/Spreading Assay-Cell spreading assays were performed by seeding cells (C6-mRAGE, C6-mRAGEv4, and C6-mock) in serum-free medium on culture slides coated with either collagen I or PBS. Culture slides were coated with either 5 g/ml collagen I or PBS control for 1 h at 37 °C followed by two washes in PBS. C6-mRAGE, -mRAGEv4, or -mock cells were then seeded in wells for 2 h at 37 °C. Unbound cells were washed from the plates with PBS, and attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The surface area of cells was determined in at least 50 cells per view in triplicate manually outlined using ImageJ software as described previously (25)(26)(27). For immunofluorescence assays, fixed cells were stained for actin and vinculin using the Actin Cytoskeleton/Focal Adhesion Staining kit (Millipore; FAK100). \n\nCell Signaling Assays-For cell signaling assays, C6-mRAGE, -mRAGEv4, or -mock cells were harvested and seeded onto 6-well plates previously coated with 5 g/ml collagen I as above for 2 h. Cells lysis was performed as described above, and Western blotting was performed using antibodies against phospho-/ total proteins including Src (p416 (6943P), p527 (2105P), and total (2123P)), Akt (phospho (4060P)/total (4691P)), ERK1/2 (phospho (4370P)/total (9102P)), and p38 (phospho (4511P)/ total (8690P)) (all from Cell Signaling Technology). Densitometry was used to quantify phospho-and total protein levels using ImageJ, and relative activity was assessed by calculating the ratio of phospho-to total protein. Western blot images shown are representative of three independent experiments. \n\nStatistical Analysis-All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Student's t test was used for comparison between experiments involving two groups, and one-way ANOVA was used for analysis of experiments involving three or more groups. A probability value of p Ͻ 0.05 was considered to be of significance. For all experiments where statistical analysis was performed, three independent experiments were analyzed. \n\nResults\n\nHuman and Mouse RAGE Undergo Constitutive Shedding in a Similar Manner-Previous studies have demonstrated that human RAGE undergoes ectodomain shedding in both a constitutive (non-stimulated) and inducible (stimulated) manner (8 -10); however, this has not been established for mouse RAGE. Although multiple sized products of RAGE have been detected in murine tissue, whether these are a result of ectodomain shedding has not been established experimentally (9,28). \n\nWe therefore first tested whether human (herein hRAGE) and mouse RAGE (herein mRAGE) undergo constitutive shedding in a similar manner (Fig. 1A). HEK-293 cells stably expressing hRAGE displayed a doublet band of ϳ52 kDa (Fig. 1B), whereas mRAGE doublet bands were only detectable at lower exposures of Western blots (data not shown). Prior studies have confirmed these doublet bands to be the non-and N-glycosylated forms of RAGE (9,10). In a similar manner, conditioned medium displayed doublet bands for hRAGE (ϳ48 kDa) and mRAGE (ϳ45 kDa) (Fig. 1B). ELISA of conditioned medium revealed hRAGE and mRAGE levels to be ϳ5000 and ϳ1500 pg/ml, respectively, which is within the physiological range seen in human serum (14). Our data confirm in the same cellular context that both hRAGE and mRAGE undergo constitutive shedding. \n\nHuman and Mouse RAGE Similarly Undergo Inducible Shedding in Response to Diverse Stimuli-Ectodomain shedding is a tightly regulated process that can be induced by a wide range of stimuli. For the majority of receptors tested to date, factors that induce ectodomain shedding include phorbol esters, calcium ionophores, serum factors, the organomercurial compound APMA that activates latent metalloproteinases, and various phosphatase inhibitors including cantharidin, calyculin A, and sodium pervanadate (12,13,29,30). Recently it was shown that shedding of hRAGE could be induced by calcium ionophores (calcimycin and ionomycin), but contrasting data were seen whether hRAGE shedding could be activated by PMA (8 -10). \n\nTo test the effects of these compounds on hRAGE and mRAGE shedding, cells were incubated for 1 h with PMA (200 nM), ionomycin (1 M), APMA (25 M), or FBS (1%). Western blotting analysis of conditioned medium revealed a similar pattern of induction for both hRAGE and mRAGE; PMA displayed a lower induction of shedding, whereas ionomycin and APMA strongly induced shedding of RAGE (Fig. 1, C and D). ELISA of neat conditioned medium revealed a similar pattern for both hRAGE and mRAGE as seen by Western blotting with a strong induction seen with of ionomycin/APMA and less intense induction with PMA (Fig. 1, E and F). Incubation with serum revealed a similar induction of shedding for both hRAGE and mRAGE (Fig. 1, E and F). As conflicting data exist for the effect of RAGE ligands on RAGE ECD shedding (8,9), we tested the effect of CML-advanced glycation end product and s100B on RAGE shedding. Both CML-advanced glycation end product and s100B induced RAGE shedding but to a lesser degree than ionomycin/APMA (Fig. 1G). To test whether inhibitors of RAGE ligand binding impacted shedding of RAGE, we tested the effect of the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 on shedding. FPS-ZM1 was developed to interact with the ligand binding domain of the receptor to block RAGE signaling (31). FPS-ZM1 treatment for 1 h led to a striking decrease in RAGE ECD shedding compared with control (Fig. 1G). These data together demonstrate human and mouse RAGE to be proteolytically processed to a similar level by diverse stimuli including RAGE ligands. \n\nRAGE Shedding Is Mediated by Metalloproteinases and Is Induced by Distinct Signaling Pathways-RAGE ectodomain shedding has been shown to be a metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism; however, the regulation of the upstream signaling mechanism has not been fully explored (8 -10). Various studies have demonstrated that protein phosphatase inhibitors are strong inducers of protein ectodomain shedding of other receptors due to their activation of numerous protein kinases (12,13,29,30). As the role of serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatases in regulating RAGE shedding has not been studied before, we tested whether phosphatase inhibition could activate RAGE shedding. Cantharidin and calyculin A are natural compounds derived from the blister beetle and marine sponge Discodermia calyx, respectively, known to inhibit the PP1/PP2A family of serine/threonine phosphatases (32,33), whereas pervanadate is a potent inhibitor of tyrosine protein phosphatases (34). As similar data were seen between hRAGE and mRAGE with all other inducers of shedding, we tested the effect of phosphatase inhibitors on hRAGE shedding in HEK-293 cells. Stimulation of Zhang et al. (10) previously demonstrated a role for PKC signaling (PKC␣ and PKC␤I) in PMA-induced shedding but found a lesser inhibition of ionophore-induced RAGE ectodomain shedding by PKC inhibition. We observed that cells treated with the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 displayed markedly reduced PMA-induced shedding of RAGE (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, to control for off-target effects of PKC inhibitors, we confirmed our data with the PKC␣ and PKC␤I inhibitor GFX109203. Treatment of cells with GFX109203 also inhibited PMA-induced shedding of RAGE (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ionomycin-induced ectodomain shedding of RAGE was not affected by either PKC inhibitor (Fig. 2B). To demonstrate that ionomycin-induced shedding could be inhibited, cells were treated with the metalloproteinase inhibitor BB94 (batimastat), which completely inhibited RAGE shedding for both PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 2, A and B). We next tested the effect of calcium chelation with EGTA on PMA-and ionomycin-induced shedding. Treatment of cells with EGTA did not impair PMA-induced shedding (Fig. 2A) but completely impaired ionomycininduced shedding (Fig. 2B). These data therefore demonstrate PMA stimulation to be independent of calcium influx and that different signaling pathways exist to activate RAGE shedding. \n\nBecause it appears that PMA and Ca 2ϩ influx (by ionomycin) stimulate RAGE shedding by distinct signaling pathways, we probed the role of other signaling pathways in this process. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways have been shown to regulate shedding of other proteins (30,34,35). Treatment of cells with inhibitors for components of the MAPK pathway including p38 (SB203580), MEK (U0126), and SAPK/JNK (SP600125) did not significantly affect PMA-or ionomycin-induced RAGE shedding (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, treatment of cells with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (LY-294002) led to reduced RAGE ectodomain shedding after stimulation with ionomycin but not PMA (Fig. 2, C and D). \n\nPrior studies have shown through gene knockdown and chemical inhibitors that the major metalloproteinase mechanism responsible for ectodomain shedding of RAGE involves ADAM10 (8 -10). We next tested whether ADAM10 is the major sheddase activated by these different signaling pathways. Inhibition of ADAM10 with GI254023X repressed RAGE ECD shedding for both PMA and Ca 2ϩ influx (by ionomycin) (Fig. 2,   E and F). These data together indicate that distinct signaling pathways involving PKC␣/PKC␤I or phosphoinositide 3kinase regulate activation of RAGE ectodomain shedding and that this is an ADAM10 metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism. \n\nIdentification of the RAGE Cleavage Site-Typically, ectodomain shedding of cell surface receptors occurs at the extracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region. For RAGE, because the fulllength RAGE protein is around 50 -55 kDa and the cleaved form of RAGE is about 48 kDa, this has led to the assumption that the cleavage site must be within the extracellular JM region. However, it is not known whether RAGE can be cleaved at multiple sites throughout the ECD, producing smaller ectodomain products. To first test whether ectodomain shedding occurs at a single cleavage site/region, we tested for RAGE cleavage products using an N-terminally epitope-tagged construct as described previously (21) (Fig. 3A). This cDNA construct of RAGE was engineered to express a His 6 -2HA tag in between the N-terminal signal sequence and the rest of the RAGE cDNA (Fig. 3A) (21). This allows epitope tag detection of all ECD cleavage products independently of RAGE antibody epitope recognition issues. Stimulation of HEK-293 cells expressing His 6 -2HA-tagged RAGE was performed with PMA, ionomycin, and APMA. Western blotting using anti-His epitope antibodies revealed a single cleaved product under all conditions at ϳ52 kDa (Fig. 3B). These data provide strong evidence to suggest that there is only a single cleavage site of RAGE and that this occurs at/around the JM region. \n\nPrior work has suggested that RAGE is proteolytically processed between amino acids Gly 331 and Ser 332 in the JM region of the extracellular domain as protein sequencing of soluble RAGE isolated from mouse lung was found to have the Gly 331 at the C terminus (10,28). To further explore this potential site of RAGE ectodomain shedding, we analyzed protein sequences of RAGE from numerous species to investigate conservation of the potential cleavage region. As RAGE is restricted to mammals (36), we aligned the RAGE protein sequence of mouse, pig, horse, and various primates (rhesus macaque and chimpanzee) with human. As shown in Fig. 4A, this region of RAGE is highly conserved with the Gly 331 -Ser 332 proposed cleavage site being conserved across all species analyzed. As point mutations of ADAM cleavage sites in target proteins have shown minimal effects on ectodomain shedding in vitro (37)(38)(39)(40) and cleavage site sequence specificity of ADAM proteins has not provided a clear consensus sequence (37)(38)(39)(40), we investigated other approaches to functionally characterize the proposed cleavage site of RAGE. Previous studies from our group have revealed that RAGE alternative splicing affects various regions of the ECD (7,20). Interestingly, in lung, kidney, and heart, one of these splice variants lacks exon 9 (mRAGEv4) and is the most prevalent murine isoform after the canonical  full-length isoform of RAGE (20). Protein alignment of mRAGE and mRAGEv4 revealed that mRAGEv4 appears to lack 9 amino acids that overlap with the proposed cleavage site (Fig. 4B). \n\nWe therefore tested whether mRAGEv4 displayed impaired ectodomain shedding compared with canonical RAGE. We generated HEK-293 cells stably expressing mRAGEv4 (Fig. 4C) and validated by flow cytometry that mRAGEv4 is indeed expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 4D). Under constitutive conditions, we were unable to detect any shed ectodomain product for mRAGEv4 in conditioned medium by either Western blot-ting or ELISA in contrast to mRAGE (Fig. 4C). We next tested whether shedding of mRAGEv4 could be induced with PMA, ionomycin, APMA, or serum. As seen with constitutive shedding, induced mRAGE shedding could readily be detected by both Western blotting and ELISA (Fig. 4, E and F). In contrast, for mRA-GEv4, we could not detect any shed ectodomain product in conditioned medium by either Western blotting or ELISA (Fig. 4, E  and F). Together, these data demonstrate that mRAGEv4 is an endogenous ectodomain cleavage-resistant isoform of RAGE. This therefore presented us with an endogenous control to explore the cellular function of RAGE ectodomain shedding. \n\nRAGE Ectodomain Shedding and Cell Function\n\nInhibition of RAGE Ectodomain Shedding Impairs Cell Migration-RAGE has been shown to affect various cell properties, most notably cell migration and adhesion (1). To test whether ectodomain shedding of RAGE is important for cell migration, we investigated its effect using C6 glioma cells. The C6 cell line has been demonstrated to be an excellent model of RAGE signaling and cell function in numerous studies (3,4,24). C6 cells that stably expressed mRAGE, mRAGEv4, or empty vector control (mock-transfected) were generated. Western blotting of cell lysate confirmed that both mRAGE and mRA-GEv4 were expressed in total cell lysates in C6 cells for multiple stably transfected cell clones (Fig. 5 A). Importantly, we did not detect any cleaved product from mRAGEv4 C6 cells in conditioned medium (Fig. 5A). We tested the effects of RAGE ectodomain shedding in transwell migration assays using various RAGE ligands. We first tested the effects of collagen I on RAGE-mediated cell migration. It has been shown that not only does RAGE bind directly and specifically to various collagens but RAGE/collagen binding enhances cell migration and adhesion (36,41,42). C6 cells expressing mRAGE displayed increased collagen-stimulated cell migration compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, cells expressing mRAGEv4 displayed migration comparable with mock cells (Fig. 5B). \n\nTo ensure these cleavage resistance effects were not ligandspecific, we next tested the effects of other RAGE ligands including the well characterized RAGE ligand s100B and 1% FBS. Recent studies have shown that serum is a rich source of numerous RAGE ligands ( [43][44][45]; furthermore, various studies have shown serum to induce RAGE-dependent cell migration and signaling effects (23, 46 -51). For both s100B and 1% FBS, C6 glioma cells expressing cleavage-resistant mRAGEv4 displayed lower levels of cell migration compared with both mock and mRAGE-expressing cells (Fig. 5, C and D). These data demonstrate RAGE ectodomain shedding to be important to facilitate RAGE ligand-mediated cell migration. \n\nInhibition of RAGE Ectodomain Shedding Impairs Cell Adhesion, Spreading, and Actin Cytoskeletal Reorganization-Integral to the process of cell migration is the ability of cells to adhere and spread on extracellular matrix components. Recent studies have revealed that RAGE promotes cell adhesion and spreading through direct binding to various extracellular matrix proteins including collagens I and IV (36,41,42). As ectodomain shedding of proteins has been shown to be critical in this cellular process, we tested the effect of RAGE cleavage on cell spreading and actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Cell spreading of C6-mRAGE-expressing cells displayed increased spreading on collagen versus non-coated plates (Fig. 6, A and B). C6-mRAGE cells also had higher levels of cell spreading on both uncoated plastic and collagen I-coated dishes compared with C6-mock cells (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, mRAGEv4expressing C6 cells displayed less spread area compared with mRAGE cells on both uncoated and collagen I-coated dishes (Fig. 6, A and B). \n\nTo further establish the mechanisms underlying these differences in cell migration and adhesion, we analyzed the actin cytoskeleton organization by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and vinculin staining in cells by immunofluorescence. Compared with mock cells, mRAGE-overexpressing cells displayed a well spread and polarized cell morphology, demonstrated by the presence of prominent actin stress fibers (Fig. 6C). Further broad cellular staining of focal adhesions (vinculin), indicative of the highly migratory phenotype of RAGE-expressing cells, was seen (Fig. 6C). In striking contrast, mRAGEv4-expressing cells displayed condensed actin stress fiber staining mainly around the cell periphery accompanied with a similar and lesser staining pattern of focal adhesions, indicating impaired adhesion, spreading, and migration (Fig. 6C). These data demonstrate RAGE ectodomain shedding to be important for the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix and their reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. \n\nInhibition of RAGE Ectodomain Shedding Impairs Cell Signaling-Next we examined the effect of RAGE ectodomain shedding on downstream signaling. RAGE has been shown to signal through diverse pathways involved in cell migration including various MAPKs (ERK1/2 and p38), PI3K/Akt, and Src (2, 3, [52][53][54][55][56]. We tested the effect of RAGE ectodomain shedding on cell signaling by plating cells on collagen I and assessing ligand activation of downstream signaling pathways. Compared with mock-expressing C6 cells, RAGE-overexpressing cells displayed increased activation of Src (both p416Src and p527Src), Akt, and ERK1/2 pathways (Fig. 7). By contrast, mRAGEv4expressing cells displayed impaired activation of signaling compared with RAGE-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7). We did not  72) and aligned using Jalview (61). These included mouse (Q62151_MOUSE), pig (A5A8Y1_PIG), horse (F6W335_HORSE), rhesus monkey (F1ABQ1_MACMU), human (Q15109_HUMAN), and chimpanzee (H2R7G0_PANTR) obtained from UniProt (72). Conserved amino acids are shown below the alignments; a \"ϩ\" is shown if two or more residues are equally conserved. Amino acid residues are colored according to the ClustalX color scheme where a color is only applied if the amino acid meets the criteria specific for the residue type at the alignment position (64) detect significant changes in the p38 pathway for mock, mRAGE, or mRAGEv4 (Fig. 7E). Together, these data demonstrate that RAGE ectodomain shedding is a critical mechanism to induce cell signaling. \n\nRAGE-mediated Cell Migration through Ectodomain Shedding Is Dependent on Activation of MAPK and PI3K Signaling,\n\nMetalloproteinases, and ␥-Secretase-Finally, we tested the mechanisms by which ectodomain shedding of RAGE activates cell migration. As the MAPK and Akt/PI3K pathways are involved in RAGE shedding and down-regulated in mRAGEv4expressing cells, we first tested how inhibitors of these pathways affect cell migration through RAGE. In mRAGE-expressing cells, both MEK (U0126) and PI3K (LY294002) inhibitors significantly reduced migration of mRAGE cells to basal mocktransfected cell levels (Fig. 8A). By contrast, both MEK (U0126) and PI3K (LY294002) inhibition had no effect on RAGE ligandmediated cell migration of mRAGEv4-or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 8A). \n\nWe next tested whether exogenous treatment of cells with the RAGE ectodomain (sRAGE) could affect ligand-stimulated cell migration in mRAGE and proteolytically resistant mRAGEv4 C6 cells. Treatment of C6-mRAGE with 5 g/ml recombinant sRAGE significantly impaired RAGE ligand-mediated cell migration compared with vehicle-treated C6-mRAGE cells (Fig. 8B). Treatment of both C6-mock and C6-mRAGEv4 cells with sRAGE did not affect cell migration (Fig. 8B). \n\nTo determine whether ectodomain shedding of RAGE regulates cell migration through a metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism, we performed experiments using broad metalloproteinase (BB94)-and ADAM10-specific (GI254023X) inhibitors. In mRAGE-expressing cells, both inhibitors BB94 and GI254023X significantly reduced migration of mRAGE cells to basal mock-transfected cell levels (Fig. 8, C and D). By contrast, neither BB94 nor GI254023X affected cell migration of mRAGEv4-or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 8, C and D). \n\nFinally, we studied the role of ␥-secretases in regulating RAGE-mediated cell migration. ␥-Secretases regulate cell signaling by cleavage of the residual membrane-bound C-terminal fragments formed by ectodomain shedding (8). Following cleavage of the C-terminal fragments by ␥-secretase, this results in the release of the ICD of receptors, which can activate FIGURE 5. RAGE ectodomain shedding affects cell migration of C6 glioma cells. A, stably transfected C6 cells (vector control, mRAGE, or mRAGEv4) were generated and assessed for RAGE expression and shedding. Shedding of mRAGE from independently generated stable transfectants (denoted as mRAGE-A or -B and mRAGEv4-A or -B) was assessed by Western blotting (WB) using polyclonal antibodies raised against the total ECD of RAGE. Cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium to allow constitutive shedding to occur. Blotting was performed on conditioned medium and total cell lysate with anti-RAGE antibodies. Cell lysates were probed with anti-␤ actin as a loading control. Images are representative of three independent experiments. B, C6 glioma cells expressing mRAGE, mRAGEv4, or empty vector (mock) were assessed for ligand-induced migration toward collagen I in transwell migration assays. Independently generated stable transfectants (denoted as mRAGE-A or -B and mRAGEv4-A or -B) were tested. Following 24h of migration, cells were fixed in crystal violet solution, and dye was extracted and quantified using spectrophotometry. Data are means Ϯ S.E. from three independent experiments (n ϭ 3). Statistical difference between groups was assessed by one-way ANOVA where * denotes significant differences (p Ͻ 0.05) between groups. Error bars represent S.E. C and D, C6 glioma cells stably expressing mRAGE, mRAGEv4, or empty vector (mock) were assessed for ligand-induced migration in transwell migration assays with S100B (C) or FBS (D). Cells were seeded into the upper chamber of a Boyden transwell filter and allowed to migrate toward 5 g/ml S100B or 1% FBS stimulant for 24 h. Cells were fixed in crystal violet solution, and dye was extracted and quantified using spectrophotometry. Data are means Ϯ S.E. from three independent experiments (n ϭ 3). Statistical difference between groups was assessed by one-way ANOVA where * denotes significant differences (p Ͻ 0.05) between groups. Error bars represent S.E. \n\nsignaling (8). Prior studies have indicated that following ectodomain shedding the remaining membrane-bound C-terminal fragment of RAGE is processed by ␥-secretase (8, 10). However, no studies have investigated whether ␥-secretase regulates RAGE function. Using the ␥-secretase inhibitor DAPT, we demonstrated that DAPT significantly reduced migration of mRAGE-expressing cells (Fig. 8E), whereas DAPT had no effect on the RAGE ligand-induced migration of either mock-or mRAGEv4-expressing cells (Fig. 8E). Together, these mechanistic studies demonstrate that not only is RAGE ectodomain shedding central to the mediating the effects of RAGE but it is dependent on an inside-out signaling mechanism. \n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the current report, we have studied the mechanisms regulating RAGE ectodomain shedding and importantly its role in cell function. First, human and mouse RAGE proteins undergo shedding in a similar constitutive and inducible manner. Second, RAGE shedding is regulated by distinct signaling pathways dependent on the stimuli. Third, we confirm that the site of cleavage occurs in the protein region close to the membrane, and RAGE ectodomain shedding can be blocked by a splice variant lacking this region of RAGE. Most importantly, we demonstrate ectodomain shedding of RAGE to be a critical mechanism in the biology of RAGE and its ability to induce cell signaling and movement. \n\nEctodomain shedding is an important post-translational mechanism that increases the range of functions of cell surface molecules (11,12). For RAGE, various studies have demonstrated that this cell surface receptor undergoes ectodomain shedding in response to various stimuli and is a metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism (8 -10). However, no studies to date have addressed whether this process is important for RAGE function. Although numerous studies have shown a role for RAGE and its soluble ECD in pathogenic states, less is known about the normal biology of RAGE. RAGE has been shown to be a pattern recognition receptor and to bind multiple ligands (4, 5, 36, 41, 42, [57][58][59]. Interestingly, RAGE is most FIGURE 6. RAGE ectodomain shedding affects cell spreading and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. A and B, cell adhesion/spreading assays were performed by seeding C6 glioma cells expressing mRAGE, mRAGEv4, or empty vector (mock) onto cell culture dishes coated with either PBS (control) or collagen I for 2 h. Independently generated stable transfectants (denoted as mRAGE-A or -B and mRAGEv4-A or -B) were tested. Adhered cells were fixed and imaged using Olympus CK2 (400ϫ magnification shown in A) with surface area estimated using ImageJ. Surface area was calculated as a percentage of control PBS cells. Data are means Ϯ S.E. from three independent experiments (n ϭ 3). Statistical difference between groups was assessed by one-way ANOVA where * denotes significant differences (p Ͻ 0.05) between groups. Error bars represent S.E. C, C6 glioma cells expressing mRAGE, mRAGEv4, or empty vector (mock) were seeded on collagen-coated cell culture dishes for 2 h, fixed, and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (actin)/anti-vinculin with GFP secondary antibody/DAPI. Cells were examined and photographed using an Olympus FV1000 microscope. Cells were examined and photographed using fluorescence microscopy. Images are representative of three independent experiments. closely related to genes coding for immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules including activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule and basal cell adhesion molecule (36), molecules with both ligand signaling properties and key functions in cell adhesion and migration. Therefore, we hypothesized RAGE ectodomain shedding to be an important mechanism to mediate the biological activity of RAGE. \n\nTo understand further how RAGE ectodomain shedding is regulated, we first tested whether RAGE ectodomain shedding is a conserved mechanism between human and mouse RAGE. Both human and mouse RAGE shedding was found to be induced in a similar magnitude by PMA, ionomycin, and APMA, suggesting common cleavage site mechanisms. As these compounds represent non-physiological stimuli, we demonstrated that serum can induce RAGE ECD shedding. Serum factors that induce ectodomain shedding include proteinaceous factors (growth factors and cytokines) as well as lipidbased factors (lysophosphatidic acid and ceramide) (11,12). Furthermore, serum is a rich source of RAGE ligands, which may activate ectodomain shedding of RAGE (9,60). To investigate whether RAGE ligands induce shedding of RAGE, we tested two highly characterized RAGE ligands for their ability to induce shedding of RAGE. Prior studies have again been conflicting in the role of RAGE ligands as inducers of RAGE ectodomain shedding (8,25,51). In our studies, both CML and S100B induced shedding of RAGE ectodomain, albeit to a lesser degree than chemical inducers of shedding. To further validate these data with RAGE ligands, we demonstrated that incubation of cells with the inhibitor FPS-ZM1 (31) led to striking impairment of RAGE shedding. \n\nTo explore the intracellular signaling mechanisms regulating induction of RAGE ectodomain shedding, we began by investigating the effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors on RAGE shedding. These compounds also mimic the effects of physiological stimuli by inducing signal transduction pathways triggered downstream of sheddase enzymes (34). We found that, in a similar manner to other stimuli of ectodomain shedding used, all protein phosphatase inhibitors induced RAGE ECD shedding (including pervanadate, calyculin A, and cantharidin). Although these inhibitors target different phosphatase types (serine/threonine versus tyrosine), we observed a similar effect, indicating the role of various diverse signaling pathways on activating RAGE shedding. Prior work has shown that PMAstimulated RAGE ectodomain shedding is inhibited by the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 (10). Furthermore, Zhang et al. (10) observed that PKC␣/PKC␤I inhibition with Gö6976 led to a decrease in shedding due to calcium influx. We observed that PKC␣/ PKC␤I inhibition with both Gö6976 and GFX109203X inhib- ited PMA-induced shedding but had no effect on RAGE shedding induced by calcium influx. Furthermore, inhibition of calcium influx by EGTA affected ionomycin-but not PMAinduced RAGE shedding, indicating key differences in the regulation of RAGE shedding. These data are consistent with studies of other receptors that display divergent mechanisms of regulation of ectodomain shedding including L-selectin, CD44, Syndecan-1, KIM-1, HER2, and ERB4 (30,34,35,62). Indeed, for CD44, shedding induced by calcium influx is insensitive to PKC␣ and PKC␤I inhibition, whereas PMA-induced shedding similarly is PKC␣/PKC␤I-dependent and calcium influx/ EGTA-independent (62). Furthermore, we cannot rule out that these effects may be mediated by other PKC isoforms as multiple isoforms beyond PKC␣/PKC␤I have been implicated in ectodomain shedding (30,63). To further probe the different signaling pathways leading to RAGE shedding, we studied the role of MAPK and PI3K signaling. For other cell surface proteins regulated by shedding, these pathways have been shown to be a key mechanism leading to the activation of sheddases (30,34,35). In our experiments, PMA-induced shedding was not affected by inhibitors against p38, MEK, SAPK/JNK, or PI3K. However, calcium influx-induced shedding was inhibited by PI3K inhibitors. \n\nPrior studies have clearly shown that RAGE ectodomain shedding is mediated by a metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism, most likely ADAM10 (8,10). Using multiple approaches including siRNA knockdown, ADAM10-specific chemical inhibitors, and cells from ADAM10 knock-out mice, it appears that ADAM10 is the major RAGE sheddase (8 -10). Our data support these findings as we observed that ADAM10 inhibition with GI254023X prevented RAGE shedding induced by both PMA and ionomycin. These data together highlight divergent mechanisms of regulating RAGE shedding (Fig. 9A). Although RAGE ectodomain shedding has been described previously (8,10), little is known about the cleavage site of RAGE. To attempt to characterize this site, we performed a number of experiments to identify the site of cleavage. Using an N-terminally epitope-tagged RAGE construct, we observed only one cleavage product even under conditions of various shedding stimulants. This supports previous data suggesting that RAGE ectodomain shedding occurs around the JM domain (10,28). For most receptors studied to date, the cleavage site for sheddases occurs around 6 -15 amino acids upstream of the start of the transmembrane region (11,12). As point mutations of potential ADAM cleavage sites in target proteins have shown limited effects on shedding in vitro (37)(38)(39)(40), we tried alternative approaches to characterizing the site and function of RAGE ectodomain shedding. Sequencing of murine soluble RAGE isolated from lung has suggested a putative cleavage site between Gly 331 and Ser 332 of RAGE (28). This site occurs in/around the short exon 9 sequence of both human and mouse RAGE. Alignment of the protein sequence of RAGE from multiple species revealed this site and the surrounding amino acid residues to be strongly conserved for RAGE, suggesting that a consensus sequence may exist for shedding. Analysis of previously isolated alternative splice variants of RAGE revealed that a variant exists that lacks exon 9 (mRAGEv4) and importantly is missing the proposed cleavage site (20). The mRAGEv4 splice variant is highly prevalent in lung, kidney, and heart (20); however, we did not previously identify this variant in human tissue (7). BLAST analysis of human RAGE cDNA revealed various cDNAs for human and primate RAGE comparable with mRA-GEv4 that lacks exon 9 (data not shown). We found that, under both constitutive and inducible conditions, the mRAGEv4 splice variant proved to be protease-resistant in multiple cell models. Therefore, these data confirm the cleavage site of RAGE to be upstream of ϳ12 amino acids of the transmembrane domain. In previous studies, it was difficult to identify the precise site of cleavage (10). It may be for RAGE as for other receptors that, rather than a precise consensus sequence of cleavage, the secondary structure of the receptor proximal to the transmembrane region is more important. As there is no clear consensus in existing ADAM10 targets, recent studies have utilized peptide libraries and proteomics to attempt to identify an ADAM10 and -17 cleavage consensus motif (65,66). It was found for ADAM10 that this sheddase prefers a Leu or aromatic amino acid (Phe, Tyr, or Trp) in the residue after cleavage (termed the P1Ј site) (65,66). However, this consensus does not cover all ADAM10 targets including RAGE, which contains a Ser in this position. Further analysis of known proteolytic substrate sites using the MEROPS database did not reveal any further protease sites around the JM region of RAGE (67). Analysis of secondary structure of mRAGE versus mRA-GEv4 splice variant did not reveal changes in secondary structures such as ␣-helix or ␤-sheets. The removal of these 9 amino acids may therefore be critical for solvent accessibility between the JM region and the transmembrane domain. These data would suggest that this, rather than altering a protein cleavage site motif, could affect accessibility of the protease to its substrate site on RAGE. The production of alternative splice isoforms that are resistant to ectodomain shedding is not unique to RAGE. Indeed, it has been shown that alternative splicing of the ERBB4 gene results in a JM region variant that is proteaseresistant (68). Moreover, as seen for RAGE in this study, expression of the non-cleavable ERBB4 splice variant altered cell growth and survival (68). This therefore raises the intriguing question whether this splice variant of RAGE that prevents shedding could affect cell function. \n\nTo understand the role of ectodomain shedding, we utilized the protease-resistant RAGEv4 splice variant to determine how it affected cell function compared with normal RAGE. One of the major functions of RAGE shown to date is its regulation of cell migration (1). We therefore investigated how ectodomain shedding of RAGE impacts cell migration. We found that expression of non-cleavable mRAGEv4 in C6 cells impaired cell migration in response to various RAGE ligands including S100B, serum, and collagen I. This was verified not to be a clonal cell resulting from stable transfection, as multiple clones of mRAGE and mRAGEv4 gave similar results. Cell migration is a complex, multifaceted process involving changes in actin cytoskeletal remodeling, focal adhesion dynamics, and cell spreading. We tested whether shedding of RAGE alters cell migration by affecting cell adhesion and spreading through altering signaling and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Expression of ectodomain shedding-resistant RAGE (mRAGEv4) impaired cell spreading and in turn was reflected by a condensed actin stress fiber staining mainly around the cell periphery and lesser staining of focal adhesions. These data are consistent with a lower migratory cell phenotype. To understand the signaling mechanisms affected by RAGE ectodomain shedding, we investigated how RAGE signaling was affected by impairment of cleavage of its ectodomain. Cells expressing ectodomain shedding-resistant RAGE displayed impaired signaling through MAPK and Akt/PI3K pathways. \n\nIt is also possible that the results seen here are due to other effects of the mRAGEv4 splice variant. First, it is possible that mRAGEv4 affects RAGE dimerization and subsequent signaling; however, this is unlikely as the region involved in the dimerization process is upstream of this region (69). Second, it is possible that mRAGEv4 affects RAGE ligand binding and signaling through alteration of the secondary structure of the RAGE ECD. This again is unlikely as the majority of ligand binding sites occur in the V-domain of RAGE, and only deletion of this domain drastically affects RAGE function as seen here (3,31,45,70,71). These data together therefore suggest ectodomain shedding of RAGE to be a mechanism of multiple functions in addition to merely generating the soluble ectodomain. \n\nOur data suggest that shedding of RAGE may be a prerequisite to induce cell signaling and affect cell function (Fig. 9B). To further explore the mechanistic regulation of RAGE ectodomain shedding and how it affects cell migration, we tested the role of various pathways in this process. Exogenous treatment of cells with the sRAGE ectodomain did not affect mRAGEv4 cell migration but, as expected, impaired mRAGE cell migration. Inhibitors of both MAPK and Akt/PI3K impaired RAGEmediated migration of C6 cells but had no effect on protease-resistant mRAGEv4-expressing cells. Similarly, broad metalloproteinase and ADAM10 inhibitors blocked mRAGEdependent cell migration without affecting mRAGEv4 cell migration. As the non-cleavable RAGE isoform blocks these cell processes, this therefore suggests production of the soluble ECD to act as a decoy; it is not the mechanism responsible for inhibiting migration and adhesion. Our data would therefore indicate that RAGE ectodomain shedding may exist to allow the release and subsequent processing of its ICD (Fig. 9). This process, known as regulated intramembrane proteolysis, typically follows ectodomain shedding and has been demonstrated to occur and be important for signaling of numerous receptors (11,12). In fact, for RAGE, it has been shown that following ectodomain shedding the remaining C-terminal fragment is further processed by a ␥-secretase (8,10). Furthermore, ectopic expression of the ICD results in a predominant nuclear expression, suggesting a direct role in gene regulation (8). Cell migration assays demonstrated that that this process is required for RAGE-mediated cell function as ␥-secretase impaired mRAGE-expressing cells from migrating but did not alter mRAGEv4-mediated migration. These data show for the first time that processing of RAGE by ␥-secretase following ectodomain shedding is a central mechanism by which RAGE mediates signaling. \n\nIn conclusion, shedding of RAGE is a precisely regulated process involving multiple signaling pathways and stimuli. Our data suggest that RAGE shedding is a critical mechanism not only to affect cell signaling but also to mediate cell functional changes. Further studies are required to explore how the RAGE ICD formed by ␥-secretase is regulated and to determine its function. Collectively, these data suggest that proteolytic regulation of RAGE is a central mechanism in RAGE biology and describe a new function by which RAGE can mediate diverse functional roles in both physiology and disease. \n\n\n\n                             \n\n\n\n                      \n\n\n\n         \n\n\n\n                        \n\n\n\n                        \n\n\n\n           \n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The rationale is that placement of children with ASD in general educational settings increases the involvement of these children in the mainstream, through the behavioral modeling of typical peers, and others' acceptance and appreciation of people with differences (Guralnick 1990;Villa et al. 1995). Current research suggests that there may be both social benefit and risk for children with ASD in inclusive settings. \n\nAccess to typical child models has been suggested as one benefit to social outcomes for children with ASD. For example, Sigman and Ruskin (1999) found that children with ASD were more socially engaged at school if they had access to typical children on the playground. Similarly, Bauminger et al. (2003) found that high functioning children with ASD were more likely to engage with a typical peer on the playground than with children with special needs. Some parents report their child's inclusive experience as being characterized by peer acceptance, and being able to form meaningful friendships with their non-disabled classmates (Ryndak et al. 1995;Staub et al. 1994). Mainstreamed classrooms may offer an ideal context to use typical peers as social models, encouraging the maintenance and generalization of skills often not achieved by interventions that use an adult interventionist (Carr and Darcy 1990;Roeyers 1996;Shearer et al. 1996). \n\nHowever, other studies demonstrate that inclusion may be insufficient to truly integrate children with ASD into the social networks of their typical peers (Burack et al. 1997), and may even pose social risks (MacMillan et al. 1996;Ochs et al. 2001;Sale and Carey 1995). High-functioning students with ASD may be at even greater risk for peer rejection than more impaired students with ASD. Students with severe disabilities may be more accepted in classrooms of mostly typical students because they readily stand out. Different expectations can lead typical peers to play a functional, protective role toward them instead of leading to rejection. On the other hand, students with mild disabilities receive little acceptance regardless of classroom composition. Yet both groups are more stigmatized and less accepted than typical students (Cook and Semmel 1999). \n\nInclusive classrooms may also be over-stimulating and lack specified staff and resources that students with ASD need, causing them to grow dependent on adults in the classroom (Mesibov and Shea 1996). From interviews with adolescents with ASD, it appears that support staff (often in the form of a paraprofessional aide) may mark children as being different, hindering rather than facilitating peer relationships (Humphrey and Lewis 2008). Researchers observing kindergarten and school aged children note that adults assigned to children with ASD are often unsure of what to do on playgrounds and interfere, blocking interactions between children and their peers, resulting in more isolation from peers while increasing the child with ASD's interactions with adults (Anderson et al. 2004). Inclusion and the practices implemented to facilitate inclusion (e.g., assignment of paraprofessionals to the child with ASD) may not always promote social success of children with ASD. \n\nChildren spend the majority of their day at school, but studies have rarely examined the friendships and peer interactions of children with ASD within this context. Rather, most studies ask children or parents to identify friendships without gathering corresponding reciprocity data. As Bauminger and Kasari (2000) note, all of the children in their sample of high functioning children with autism identified a friend. Most children were identified from their school setting; however, several children identified friends that mothers later indicated was the child's tutor, stepdad, or other unusual choice. Without data from the nominated friend of the child with ASD, we could not judge reciprocity of friendships. In a later study of second and third grade children, we found that approximately one-third of nominated friends reciprocated the friendship of children with ASD at school compared to sixty percent for typical children from the same class (Chamberlain et al. 2007). Thus, reciprocity at school appears to be lower for children with ASD. \n\nWhile multiple informants are important in determining the social inclusion of children with ASD at school, reporters do not always agree on the degree to which children are socially included. In particular, children with ASD experience misperception of their social involvement at school; they may see themselves as more or less socially involved than their peers or parents report. For example, in one study we found that children with ASD saw themselves as more connected than their peers saw them. Children with ASD nominated many more children as friends at school than peers nominated them (Chamberlain et al. 2007). In another study, children identified fewer friends from any context or setting than their mothers identified for them (Bauminger and Kasari 2000). In this latter study, we did not obtain peer reports so that it was unclear if mothers over-identified or children under-identified their friends. \n\nDetermining inclusion success appears different depending on the reporter (e.g. peer, child with ASD, parent, teacher) and the circumstances (e.g., observations of actual behavior on playgrounds or survey). \n\nOne limitation to our current knowledge of children's experiences at school is that most studies describe the experiences of only a few children and are limited in the number of measures and reporters that they include. Thus, studies may obtain the child's report of relationships, and/or their teacher's or parent's report, but rarely reports from peers and/or observations of spontaneously occurring peer interactions. In our previous reports of classroom peer nominations, both peers and children with ASD agreed that children with ASD were more often peripheral in their classroom social networks (Chamberlain et al. 2007;Rotheram-Fuller et al. in press). Children with ASD also reported lower quality friendships (Bauminger and Kasari 2000;Chamberlain et al. 2007), and their difficulties with their peer social networks were greater at the older grades than the younger grades (Rotheram-Fuller et al. in press). However, these studies did not include actual observations of peer relationships, nor did they include impressions from teachers. Teachers and independent observers of children's social interactions on the playgrounds offer important additional information on the social inclusion of children with ASD. \n\nIt is expected that the peer social network nominations of children should be in line with observations of children on their school playgrounds. Thus, peer reports of children with ASD as peripheral to their classroom social networks should predict that they would be largely unengaged on their school playgrounds. Indeed, studies that have observed children with ASD on playgrounds suggest that they are often unengaged with peers; they make fewer attempts to interact with other children, and are less responsive to other's bids for social interaction (Sigman and Ruskin 1999). One study found that just four behaviors discriminated over 90% of children with ASD on the playground from other children. These behaviors included poor social engagement with peers, lack of respect for personal space, isolation, and inappropriate behavior (Ingram et al. 2007). The consistent finding that children with ASD are isolated or unengaged on the playground may be due to several possibilities, including that children distance themselves from interactions with others (perhaps wanting to be alone) or that they are unengaged due to their own or others' actions on the playground. At this point, we do not know how the children themselves (both peers and the child with ASD) and their teachers view their relationships, and how these relationships may play out on the school playground. To date, researchers have not connected all of these measures together in the same study. \n\nThe goal of the current study was to connect self and other perceptions to actual observations of children on their playgrounds, and to teacher reports of social interactions at school. While we recognize that children can have friendships in many different contexts, they spend the greatest amount of time at school, and it is the context in which social relationships can have added benefit to both social and academic development. Moreover, for children with ASD, school is the context in which they can feel loneliness and isolation (Bauminger and Kasari 2000). We expected that children with ASD would receive fewer reciprocated friendship nominations, report poorer quality friendships, and be viewed by their peers as more peripheral in their classroom social networks (Bauminger and Kasari 2000;Chamberlain et al. 2007;Rotheram-Fuller et al. in press). In this study, however, a primary goal was to examine the association between independent observations of children on the school playground with teacher, peer and self reports of peer relationships. We hypothesized that children who were more peripheral in their social networks, would be less engaged on the playground, have fewer friendships, and receive poorer teacher reports of social skills. \n\nBecause children with ASD in this study ranged from first to fifth grade, we were also interested in grade related differences in our measures. In a previously completed study involving 79 children with ASD in kindergarten through fifth grade, grade related changes were found in children's social networks (Rotheram-Fuller et al. in press). Sixty of these children are participants in the current study and received the additional measures that are the focus of this study (including measures of friendship quality, teacher report of social relationships, and independent playground observations). Thus, we can begin to examine grade-related differences in the connections between self and other reports and actual behaviors of children with ASD in inclusive classrooms. \n\nMethod\n\nParticipants\n\nA total of 243 children were prescreened for participation in this study and 83 families signed consent from August 2003 to September 2007. The majority of families who did not meet the prescreening criteria lived outside of our catchment area (within 90 min of the University). Children were included in this study if they had a diagnosis of ASD from a licensed psychologist, if they met criteria for ASD on the ADI-R and ADOS, were fully included in a regular education classroom for at least 80% of the school day, were between the ages of 6-11 years old and in grades 1-5, and had an IQ of 65 or higher. Children were excluded from this study if they had additional diagnoses. Of the 83 children with ASD who signed consent, 23 did not participate for a variety of reasons (nine schools refused participation; six parents withdrew before the assessments; six children did not meet the IQ criteria; two children did not meet criteria for ASD). All peers from each participating child with ASD's classroom were then invited to participate in the study. Both parental consent and child assent were obtained from all participating peers. \n\nA Children with ASD were from diverse ethnic backgrounds (46.7% Caucasian, 5% African American, 21.7% Latino, 16.7% Asian, and 10% Other) and were predominantly male (90%). All were fully included in regular education classrooms for 80% or more of the school day and were an average of 8.14 ± 1.56 years old, with an average IQ of 90.97 ± 16.33. One family refused the IQ test but previous reports of IQ were in the normal range. Sixty percent of the children with ASD were assigned a 1:1 aide in the classroom and on the playground. Children assigned an aide had significantly lower IQs than children without an aide, t(1, 57) = 3.07, p = .003. Average IQ of children with NO AIDE (N = 24) was 98.33 (SD = 19.23) and of children WITH AIDE (N = 35) was 85.91 (SD = 11.86). \n\nTo allow for direct comparisons to the children with ASD, a subsample of typical children was randomly selected from each child's classroom that matched the children with ASD on gender, age, grade and classroom. Typically developing children were an average of 7.86 ± 1.43 years old. Further demographic data were not available for the matched peers. \n\nMeasures\n\nFriendship Qualities Scale (FQS; Bukowski et al. 1994). The FQS is a 23-item questionnaire that examined five features of friendship quality: (a) companionship (amount of voluntary time spent together), (b) help (encompassing both aid and protection from victimization), (c) security (including trust and the idea that the relationship will transcend specific problems), (d) closeness (consisting of both the child's feelings toward the partner and his or her perceptions of the partner's feelings), and (e) conflict (disagreements in the friendship relation). Children rated how true a sentence description was of their best friendship using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = always). This measure has been used in previous studies of children with autism and their peers (Bauminger and Kasari 2000;Bauminger et al. 2004;Chamberlain et al. 2007). \n\nPlayground Observation of Peer Engagement (POPE) (Kasari et al. 2005). Designed for this study, the POPE is a time-interval behavior coding system. Researchers recorded children's engagement with peers on the playground, and frequency of initiations and responses (see Table 1 for description). Independent observers watched the target child on the playground for 40 consecutive seconds and then coded for 20 s for at least ten minutes during the recess or lunch play period on two separate occasions within 1 week. The observers noted the child's engagement with peers on the playground (solitary, proximity, onlooking, parallel, parallel aware, involved in games with rules and joint engaged with peers) in each interval. Playground engagement states were summed for a total proportion of intervals in each engagement state. \n\nCoders also noted two types of children's initiations toward other children. First, observers coded for successful initiations to peers where the child directs communication to a peer/peers (e.g. offers toy, greets, asks to play game, comments, states facts, etc.) and the peer responds with a nonverbal gesture (e.g. head nod/shake, follows the child, laughs, etc.) or verbal language. Second, observers rated children's failed initiation attempts where the target child directs communication to a peer/peers and the peer does not respond or ignores the child. Coders also noted two types of child responses to others including the children's appropriate responses to a peer's initiation (e.g. child says yes when a peer asks him/her to play) as well as the child's missed responses to a peer's initiation (e.g. a peer asks him/ her to play and the child does not respond). Playground observations included a comment section where the observer qualitatively documented whether or not the child had a 1:1 aide and the type of activity he/she engaged in with the child on the yard. \n\nPlayground engagement states were summed into total interval counts that yielded a total percentage of intervals in each engagement state, and frequency of social behaviors (e.g., initiating to others and responding to peers' social overtures) within each observed interval. To correct for varying intervals per observation, the number of intervals children spent in each engagement state was divided by the total number of observed intervals for that observation period. \n\nPrior to beginning the study, all observers were trained and considered reliable with percent agreement [.80. Observers then overlapped on 15% of all observations distributed over the course of the study to assess coder reliability and drift. When conducting reliability two observers overlapped on sessions and began their stopwatches at the same time, but coded independently. Reliability was estimated with Kappa statistic, and averaged .91 (range .83-.96). \n\nTeacher Perception Measure. The Teacher Perception Measure was a 26 item questionnaire completed by teachers and adapted from the Personal Maturity Scale (Alexander and Entwisle 1988), the Child Behavior Checklist for Preschool-Aged Children, Teacher Report (Achenbach et al. 1987) and the Behavior Problems Index (Zill 1990) by the Early Head Start FACES program. The adapted measure used a 3-point Likert scale to rate 12 items regarding teachers' perceptions of students' social skills (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = very often) and 14 items regarding the teacher's perceptions of children's classroom conduct (1 = not true, 2 = somewhat or sometimes true, 3 = very true or often true). The social skills domain described the child's strengths, such as adaptability to the school classroom and environment, quality of interactions with peers, and popularity or likeability among peers. The classroom conduct domain described problems, such as disruptive, impulsive, withdrawn, and depressive behaviors; problems in school-related skills and motivation; and difficulty following directions. The Early Head Start FACES program reported good internal consistency for this measure, ranging from .72 to .88. Social Networks and Friendship Survey. Children were asked to identify who they like to hang out with in their classroom. From this list the children generated, they were instructed to circle their top 3 friends, and place a star next to their best friend from among the 3 names that were circled. They were also asked to list any children they did not like to hang out with (rejects). Next, participating students were asked: ''Are there kids in your class who like to hang out together? Who are they?'' Children listed the names of other children who hung around together in groups; they were reminded to include themselves in groups as well as to remember to include students of both genders. Children circled the groups of children who they identified as hanging out together. This method has been used in various studies from early childhood through adolescence to assess the social structure of individual classrooms for both typical and atypical populations (Cairns and Cairns 1994;Farmer and Farmer 1996;Chamberlain et al. 2007;Locke et al. 2010). \n\nCoding Indegrees, Outdegrees, Connects, and Rejects. These variables were coded from the Friendship Survey. Indegrees were coded as the total number of received friendship nominations -the number of classmates that listed the child as ''someone they like to hang out with,'' whereas outdegrees were coded as the total number of outward friendship nominations by the child-the number of classmates the child listed as ''someone they like to hang out with.'' Children's connects score was calculated as the total number of children that were significantly linked on the social network map. Each line segment from the social network map indicated a significant connection to a classmate from that child (See Fig. 1). Lastly, rejects were coded as the total number of times children were identified as someone other children ''did not like to hang out with''. \n\nCoding Friendship Reciprocity. Children were considered to have reciprocal friendships if they selected each other as their top 3 or best friends within the classroom. A conservative method of determining reciprocal friendships was used, such that when one of the students nominated was absent, or did not complete the measure, it was coded as missing data instead of a non-reciprocal friendship. \n\nCoding Social Network Centrality (Cairns and Cairns 1994). Following Cairns and Cairns (1994), social network analyses were conducted in order to obtain each child's social network centrality score. Social network centrality refers to the prominence of an individual in the overall classroom social structure. Three related scores were calculated in order to determine a student's level of involvement in the classroom's social networks: (1) the student's ''individual centrality,'' (2) the ''cluster centrality'' of each social group within the class, and (3) the student's combined ''social network centrality'' score. Using methods developed by Cairns and Cairns (1994), the first two types of centrality were used to determine the third (Cairns et al. 1990;Farmer and Farmer 1996). Based on categorizations by Farmer and Farmer (1996), four levels of social network centrality were possible. These four levels of involvement (i.e. isolated, peripheral, secondary, and nuclear) in the classroom's social structure were coded from 0 to 3, to provide a system for describing how well the child with ASD was integrated into the informal peer networks. Children that were considered 'isolated' received a score of 0 for their social network centrality and were not considered part of any cluster of children within their classroom. Children that were considered 'peripheral' received a score of 1 for their social network centrality and were considered on the outskirts of their classroom's social structure. These children may have a few connections to other children within the classroom but are not salient members of their classroom's social network. Children that were considered 'secondary' received a score of 2 on their social network centrality and were considered well connected members of their classroom social structure. Lastly, children that were considered 'nuclear' received a score of 3 on their social network centrality and were considered 'popular' and central members of their classroom social structure. These children were individually salient (nominated frequently) and were also significantly connected to other children who were very salient on an individual level. Children's total social network centrality status could only be as high as their lowest centrality score derived from their individual or cluster centrality score. \n\nProcedures\n\nOnce families completed the informed consent process, they were assessed by independent evaluators to validate the clinical diagnosis of ASD via the ADI-R (Lord et al. 1994) and ADOS (Lord et al. 2000) evaluations. Independent evaluators also administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III; Weschler 1991) to obtain a developmental quotient. Children with an IQ of 65 or higher and who had a diagnosis of ASD were included in the study. \n\nUpon entry into the study, research personnel contacted the target child's school and obtained a letter of school participation for the study. Once school approval was obtained, consent forms were distributed to all children in the class. Children were informed that their classroom was selected to participate in a research study examining children's friendships and social skills. Children, who returned informed consent from their parents, as well as offered assent to join the study, completed the social network measures (including brief demographic information) and the Friendship Qualities Scale. To ensure understanding of the measures, research personnel provided verbal instructions on how to complete the instruments and individually assisted children who had difficulty reading and/or writing and/or were in the youngest grades. Children in the older grades independently completed the measures after instructions were given. In addition, teachers were asked to complete the Teacher Perceptions Scale for the child with ASD during this visit. Within the same week of distributing classroom measures, research personnel gathered behavioral observations on the playground during two separate recess periods. \n\nResults\n\nAnalyses below are based on 120 children, 60 children with ASD and a paired sample of 60 typically developing peers (children matched on age and gender from the same classroom). There were no differences on outcome measures between children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (n = 16) and autism (n = 44); therefore, the following analyses included all 60 children with ASD. We first report descriptive data for the groups on measures of peer nomination and friendship ratings: social network centrality, friendship nominations (indegrees, outdegrees, connections, rejects, reciprocity of best and top 3 friends), and friendship quality ratings. In each case, we tested for group and grade-related differences. Next we report the descriptive data for the playground observations of children with ASD, and finally report individual differences in measures for the children with ASD. \n\nDescriptive Data: Self-and Other Perceptions of Social Connections for Children With and Without ASD Social Network Centrality. For the group of children with ASD, 8 children were isolated, 25 had peripheral status, 22 had secondary status, and five had nuclear social status. In contrast, none of the typically developing children were isolated, six had peripheral status, 35 had secondary status and 19 had nuclear status. See Fig. 2. \n\nConsistent with our earlier studies, an ANOVA indicated that there was a significant group difference for social network centrality, F(1, 116) = 38.57, p \\ .0001. Children with ASD had significantly poorer social network centrality (1.38 ± .09) compared to typically developing matched peers (2.20 ± .09). There was a significant main effect of grade level, F(1, 116) = 4.87, p = .03 where children in the older grades (3rd-5th) had lower social network centrality (1.65 ± .10) than children in the younger grades (1st-2nd; 1.93 ± .09). There was no significant interaction between grade and diagnostic group. \n\nFriendships, Connections, and Rejections. A MANOVA with grade and diagnostic group as independent variables was used to compare the number of children's friendships, connections, and rejections within his/her classroom between typically developing children and children with ASD. Of the 120 children, 114 children were used in this analysis because three children with ASD did not complete the rejections portion of the friendship survey, as it was added after the study began; thus, these students (and their matched peers) were excluded from this analysis. \n\nThe multivariate result was significant for group, Wilks Lambda = .79, F(1, 106) = 7.13, p B .001, indicating a difference in friendships between children with ASD and their typically developing peers. The univariate F tests showed a significant difference between children with ASD and their matched peers for the number of friends they nominated within the classroom (outdegrees; F(1, 106) = 8.57, p = .004), the number of received friendship nominations by other children (indegrees; F(1, 106) = 18.84, p B .001), and the number of classroom connections (connects; F(1, 106) = 14.61, p B .001). Children with ASD nominated fewer peers as friends (3.76 ± .34), were nominated fewer times as a friend by peers (1.48 ± .24) and had Fig. 2 Bar graph of the frequency of social network centrality status for children with ASD and their typically developing matched peers fewer overall classroom connections (i.e., smaller social networks; 2.76 ± .33) than their typically developing matched peers (5.17 ± .34; 2.92 ± .24; 4.54 ± .33, respectively). Children with ASD did not differ from typically developing children in their percentage of connections to peers by gender. Boys were more often connected to boys and girls to girls for both groups. Lastly, when examining children's number of rejections, there was no significant difference in the number of rejection nominations received by children with ASD relative to their matched peers. There was no main effect of grade or a group by grade interaction for these outcomes (see Fig. 3). \n\nReciprocal Friendships. Both reciprocated top 3 friends and best friendships were examined using an ANOVA. For their top 3 friends, the overall model was significant, F(3, 99) = 13.12, \\ .0001 with a significant main effect for group, F(1, 99) = 39.22, p \\ .0001.The percentage of children's reciprocal friendships with their nominated top three best friends was significantly lower for children with ASD (17.91% ± 5.32) in comparison to their typically developing matched peers (63.91% ± 5.07). There was no main effect of grade or a group by grade interaction. \n\nThe overall model was significant for reciprocal best friends, F(3,61) = 3.94, p = .0123, with a significant main effect of group, F(1, 61) = 10.82, p = .0017. Children with ASD had fewer reciprocal best friends than did typical children, (11.33% ± 8.4 compared to 44.97% ± 7.08), respectively. There was no main effect of grade or a group by grade interaction. See Fig. 4. \n\nIn addition, there was no difference between children with ASD and typically developing children in whether they selected a same-sex best friend (v 2 (1, N = 116) = 3.42, p = .09). The majority of both groups chose same sex best friends, 56 out of 60 typically developing children and 46 out of 56 children with ASD. Four children with ASD did not list any peer as a friend. \n\nFriendship Quality Scale. A MANOVA with grade and diagnostic group as independent variables was used to compare the five domains of child-rated friendship quality (i.e. companionship, help, security, conflict, and closeness) between typically developing children and children with ASD. Of the 120 children in the matched sample, 116 children were used in this analysis. Four children with ASD did not list a best friend and therefore did not complete the FQS; therefore, they were excluded from the analysis. \n\nThe multivariate result was significant for group, Wilk's Lambda = .84, F(1, 108) = 4.13, p = .002, indicating a difference in friendship quality between children with ASD and their typically developing peers. The univariate F tests showed there was a significant difference between children with ASD and their matched peers for closeness, F(1, 108) = 17.87, p B .001, security, F(1, 108) = 4.45, p = .04, helpfulness F(1, 108) = 15.00, p B .001, and companionship, F(1, 108) = 8.60, p = .004, in that children with ASD reported poorer friendship quality in all four domains (see Table 2). Children's perceptions of conflict with respect to their best friendships were not significantly different between the two groups. There was no main effect of grade or a group by grade interaction for any domain of friendship quality (see Fig. 5). \n\nWithin the Autism Group Analyses: Playground Observations of Children with ASD\n\nOn the playground, children with ASD were engaged with their peers for just over a third of the observed intervals on the playground (38.6% of the total intervals). Children engaged in structured games with rules for approximately 20% of the observed intervals, and 18.6% of the observed intervals in joint engaged activities, such as having a conversation. For the remaining percentage of observed intervals, children were either solitary/unengaged (33.4%), or in lower levels of engagement: parallel play (6%); in proximity to other children (8%); parallel aware (engaging in similar activities with mutual social awareness; 7%); and onlooking (watching another group of children engaged in a game or activity; 7%). The rate of initiations to peers was, on average, once every 3 intervals (mean of 5.13 initiations during 15.79 observed playground intervals). Peers responded to the child with ASD in approximately 66% of the opportunities observed. Peers also initiated to the child with ASD an average of once every four intervals and the child with ASD responded to the peer in 75% of the opportunities observed. \n\nChildren with ASD who had a higher percentage of intervals observed in joint engagement and games on the playground also initiated to other children more often on the playground, r = .45, p B .001, and responded more to peers' initiations, r = .57, p B .001. In addition, children with ASD who were more engaged on the playground were significantly less likely to have a 1:1 aide, r = -.27, p = .04. \n\nQualitative notes from observations: In order to determine if children with an aide were more likely to be interacting with their aide rather than with other children, we examined the qualitative comments made by the independent coders for each observation. During the playground observations the observer noted if the child was interacting with their aide or with peers. Two raters further coded the qualitative comments about what the child was doing during recess. These raters agreed 100% on the statements about the child's behavior and the role of the aide. Categories included child unengaged but peers nearby, completely unengaged with peers or adults, wandering or unfocused, engaged with the aide or engaged with peers. Half of the children assigned an aide were observed as unengaged on the playground (18/ 36 children or 50%), 12 were wandering or unfocused and 6 were unengaged with peers but other children were nearby (e.g., eating nearby, or digging in the sand nearby). Another 14% (5 children) were observed interacting with their aide only. The rest of the sample (13/36 or 36%) was observed interacting with peers or engaged in games. Children with an aide were most often unengaged on the playground, neither interacting with peers or with the aide. \n\nConnections Between Playground Observations, Peer, Self and Teacher Reports for Children with ASD Correlations were run to determine if playground variables (engagement/games, unengaged/solitary, initiations, responses) were associated with peer nominations (indegrees, outdegrees, rejects, connects), social network centrality (SNC), and friendship quality for the children with ASD. None of the correlations reached significance. \n\nWe then explored whether children with ASD who were more engaged on the playground differed by teacher report of social skills. Using chi square statistics, we found that teachers rated children who were more engaged on the playground as having higher social skills, although the association was only marginally significant, v 2 (1, N = 56) = 3.78, p = 06. \n\nNext we tested whether the children who had a reciprocal friendship were more engaged on the playground, and whether peers rated these children differentially. Twenty percent of the children with ASD (N = 12) had at least one reciprocal friendship. These children had significantly higher social network centrality scores (2.17 ± .20) as compared to children with ASD who did not have a reciprocal friendship (1.24 ± .11; v 2 (1, N = 49) = 11.59, p = .001). Having a reciprocal friendship, however, was not associated with being more engaged on the playground (v 2 (1, N = 49) = .67, p = 1.00). \n\nDiscussion\n\nChildren with ASD in general education classrooms are most often on the periphery of their classroom social  networks. Their social networks are smaller than typical classmates, the friendships they identify are less often reciprocated, and the quality of their friendships is poorer. These data for children in first through fifth grade are consistent with a previous report on second and third graders (Chamberlain et al. 2007), and further document the significant social impairment that these children experience at school. However, the current data go beyond our earlier report in three main ways. First, our previous study was limited to a small number of high functioning children with ASD (N = 17) and a more cohesive set of classrooms in which schools participating tended to have more services available, and may have been motivated to participate because 'things were going well' (Chamberlain et al. 2007). We found that none of the children in our previous study were isolated, but they were more often peripheral in their social networks. Moreover, a gender effect was noted, with mostly boys with ASD connected to social networks of girls (Chamberlain et al. 2007). In the current study, a larger sample of 60 children with ASD was recruited from a diverse set of classrooms (half were from Title I schools). We found again that children with ASD were mostly peripheral in their classroom social networks, but there were also isolated children (approximately 13% of the sample). The gender effect we found previously was not noted in the current study. Thus, consistent with typical peer social interactions, boys were connected to boys and girls to girls, and these findings were consistent for younger and older children with ASD (Fein 1981;Pellegrini et al. 2007). \n\nReciprocity of friendships was particularly low for this sample of children, 18% compared to 64% of their typical classmates, and also lower than a previous study of 34% of second and third graders with ASD (Chamberlain et al. 2007). Friendships of children with ASD may be better characterized as unilateral rather than reciprocal. Because friendships in the school context are important given the amount of time children spend in school, and the importance of friends in promoting social and academic outcomes (Ladd 1999), it will be important for future studies to determine whether unilateral friendships satisfy similar needs as reciprocal friendships for children with ASD (Freeman and Kasari 1998). Additionally, friendships outside of the school setting may provide a protective function to children while in school, although studies have not examined this possibility. \n\nSecond, there is some data suggesting that children with ASD have poorer relationships at older ages (Orsmond et al. 2004;Rotheram-Fuller et al. in press). While we found group effects in nearly all measures with children with ASD doing less well compared to their typically developing classmates, we found few grade differences and no grade by group differences. There was only a grade effect for social network centrality with all children (children with and without ASD) having lower social network centrality at the older grades. Relationships in general become more selective (and perhaps more challenging to maintain) as children get older (Howlin et al. 2004;Orsmond et al. 2004). This phenomenon appears the same for children with ASD as it is for typically developing children. \n\nThird, prior studies have not linked peer and child self reports to systematic and independent playground observations and teacher reports. Thus, the current study extends our previous findings by examining the links between peer, self, and teacher reports, and observations of children in their natural environment at school. One might expect that children whose peers see them as more socially connected to other children in the class would also be more engaged on the playground. Yet, contrary to our expectations, there was little association between playground engagement and peer nominations of social connections. Regardless of social status in the classroom, children with ASD were just as likely to be unengaged on the playground if they were rated as popular or isolated. Moreover, even with a reciprocal friendship, children with ASD were no more engaged on the playground than were children with ASD who did not have a reciprocal friendship. Although a limitation of the study is the lack of comparable playground data for the typical peers, these data do provide insight into the potential problems children with ASD experience on the playground, despite having some important connections to their peers. \n\nThere are several reasons why the playground may be a difficult environment for children with ASD. One is that in contrast to the structure and expectations of the classroom in which children may be able to connect with peers, the playground is often chaotic and crowded. Even with a reciprocal friend, children with ASD may be unable to access the playground culture at their school. While adults may be present on the yard, they are often more concerned with safety than with facilitation of engagement between peers (Anderson et al. 2004). Indeed, adults often believe recess is a time away from adult intrusions, and that most children understand how to play with each other (Giangreco and Broer 2005). Yet, for children with ASD, playing and engaging with others is likely the most difficult time of their day. It seems likely that the playground is a good setting for social skills interventions for children with autism. As a result, one of the most common interventions for children with ASD is to assign support staff, often in the form of a 1:1 aide (Anderson et al. 2004). In this study, over half of the children were assigned an aide. Children with aides were less likely to be engaged with peers on the playground, and qualitative data indicated they were mostly unengaged from their peers and also not engaged with their aides. These data suggest that aides were unable to facilitate more peer engagement of children on the playground. Future studies should carefully consider the role of the paraprofessional assigned to children with ASD. Several studies now highlight the critical need for aide training, so that aides learn how to best facilitate interactions between children, and take care not to stigmatize and otherwise isolate the child with ASD (Anderson et al. 2004;Humphrey and Lewis 2008;Brown et al. 2001). \n\nFinally, the situation for children with ASD in inclusive classrooms was not completely bleak. Children with ASD did not differ from typical children in the number of rejection nominations they received from their peers. This finding, along with the relatively low levels of isolated children nominated on the social networks measure, suggests that children with ASD have more potential for fitting into their typical school classrooms than other data-based and anecdotal reports would suggest (Church et al. 2000;Humphrey and Lewis 2008). Rather than active rejection, children with ASD may fall into the class of neglected children, often overlooked as potential playmates by other children in the class (Asher and Wheeler 1985). \n\nWhile our informant measures (peer, teacher and child with ASD) did not link to our playground observations, observations of children on the playground yielded consistent data for children's level of engagement with initiations and responses to peers. When children were engaged in games or conversations, there were more initiations and responses to and from peers. Thus, increasing engagement with children on the playground is an important target of intervention that may move children from the periphery of groups to more central roles within the group. More engagement may lead to increased opportunities to hone social skills, both in navigating positive interactions, and in negotiating conflicts. Better engagement on the playground also appears associated with more get-togethers of children outside of school (Frankel et al. 2010). Therefore, a goal for future studies will be to more closely examine the effects of increased engagement on children's social developmental outcomes. \n\nThe current study goes beyond earlier studies by combining data from multiple sources and by using multiple methods on a large sample of children with autism. Still, there remain a number of limitations that should be considered in interpreting the findings, and in designing future studies. First, this study highlights some of the difficulties in working within school settings that involve as few as 1 or 2 classrooms per school that contain a child with autism. Obtaining enough data on each child becomes a challenge when sample sizes are fairly large (n = 60) and classrooms are many, as in the present report. Beyond the relatively small corpus of observational data per participant (two recess periods in one week contributing less than 30 min of observational data), other limitations include the lack of data on the typically developing matched peers. We were unable to collect playground observational data and other background information on the typical classmates. This may be avoided in future studies if the typical classmates are consented and matched from the beginning of the study. Our approach was to utilize all of the children in the class to obtain the social network centrality measure and then to randomly select one child who could match the child with autism on meaningful variables of age, gender and same classroom. We were not able to verify ethnicity, or other background variables on the children, and it is possible that these variables may have influenced the results despite the fact that children were in the same class, same school and same neighborhood. Future studies will need to consider these factors in making comparisons to children with autism in general education classrooms. \n\nIn summary, this study provides a unique look into the school social experiences of a diverse group of highfunctioning children with ASD. Information was gathered from multiple sources, including the child with ASD, his or her peers, and teacher, as well as independent observations of interactions on the child's playground. While measures converged from multiple informants (teachers, peers and child with ASD) on the level of connection between the child and his or her peers and the reciprocity of their friendships, there was little association to observations made independently on the playground. Thus, these data yield a complicated picture of the social lives of children with ASD suggesting that success with peers may be greater if the supports are in place to engage children with their peers on the school playground. \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n",

    "text": "\nBackground\n\nThe thylakoid network, a three-dimensional system of internal chloroplast membranes, is a space where photosynthetic light reactions take place.The main components of photosynthetic apparatus are multisubunit chlorophyll-protein (CP) complexes: photosystem II (PSII), the cytochrome b 6 f complex (Cyt b 6 f ), and photosystem I (PSI).They are connected electrochemically by the mobile electron carriers: plastoquinone (PQ) and plastocyanin.Most of the photons used in the light reactions of photosynthesis are harvested by the Light-Harvesting Complex II (LHCII), which can act as an outer antenna of both photosystems.Switching of the LHCII pool between PSII and PSI serves as an adjustment mechanism that regulates the amount of excitation energy distributed to the reaction centers [1].This mechanism, called state transitions, is regulated via reversible phosphorylation of LHCII, which is catalyzed by the STATE TRANSITION 7 (STN7) kinase [2].The illumination that favors the excitation of PSII, leads to a high reduction of the PQ pool and activation of STN7 kinase [3].STN7 phosphorylates Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 subunits of LHCII [1], which results in the dissociation of phosphorylated LHCII (P-LHCII) from PSII and energy distribution towards PSI (state 2).Contrarily, upon illumination that favors the excitation of PSI resulting in PQ oxidation, the P-LHCII pool gets dephosphorylated by the constitutively active thylakoid phosphatase TAP38/ PPH1, which leads to reassociation of LHCII to PSII (state 1) [4,5].In a classical view of state transitions, in state 2, P-LHCII migrates through the thylakoid membrane towards unstacked membrane margins where PSI is located [6][7][8], to associate with PSI forming the PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex [9,10].However, recent discoveries suggest that the PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex is formed using the LHCII pool already present in unstacked membranes, thus migration of P-LHCII through thylakoid membrane is limited [11,12].\n\nFrom known posttranslational modifications of LHCII such as phosphorylation, acetylation [13], and polyamination [14] the first one plays the dominating role in the induction of CP complexes rearrangements under fluctuating environmental conditions.Light quality and intensity are the main factors influencing the activity of STN7 kinase.However, several reports show its activation under dark conditions.In our previous work, we reported an increased LHCII phosphorylation in Arabidopsis thaliana under dark conditions [15].Non-photochemical reduction of PQ, which activates STN7 kinase in the dark, was reported for Arabidopsis to be mediated by Proton Gradient Regulator 5 (PGR5) independent antimycin A sensitive pathway [16] and by NAD(P) H dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) in dark-anaerobic conditions [17].It was also reported that temperature influences STN7 kinase activation in the dark.LHCII phosphorylation was observed under moderate heat stress (40 °C) in the dark in wheat [18] and Arabidopsis [19].Moreover, low temperature in the dark caused an increase in the LHCII phosphorylation in the runner bean [20].LHCII phosphorylation under dark-chilling conditions seems to be a species specific phenomenon, as for garden pea a contradictory effect was observed (decrease in LHCII phosphorylation under dark-chilling) [20].Interestingly, in Arabidopsis only a transient increase was detected [15,19,21].\n\nPlant response to low-temperature is a complex process that influences plant metabolism on all levels of organization.On the chloroplast level, low temperature causes the reduction of photochemical reactions capacity, reorganization/degradation of CP complexes [22,23], the decrease of Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle enzymes activity, lipid peroxidation, and the increase of ROS level [reviewed in : 24, 25-27].Consequently, these lead to the imbalance of chloroplast redox poise.In chloroplast, thioredoxin systems play a central role in the detection and signaling of the redox status [reviewed in 28].The ferredoxin-thioredoxin system, relies on reducing equivalents generated in the chloroplast electron transport chain to supply electrons from reduced ferredoxin to various thioredoxins through ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase [reviewed in 29,30].Other system involves NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) [31].NTRC is reduced by NADPH generated both in the chloroplast electron transport chain in the light and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) in the dark and under low irradiance [31,32].There are evidences that NTRC activity is related with LHCII phosphorylation as Arabidopsis mutant overexpressing NTRC presents LHCII phosphorylation even in the dark [33].Also, NTRC has been suggested to regulate cold response.The work of Moon et al. [34] showed that NTRC overexpression enhances Arabidopsis tolerance to freezing and low temperatures.Contradictorily, it was proved that the transcript level of NTRC decreases during 24 h of chilling stress in Arabidopsis [35].However, Chae et al. [36] reported that both cold and heat induce the NTRC transcript, while dark and extended night had an opposite effect.\n\nIn this study we characterized the light-independent STN7 kinase activation pathway which operates in runner bean under dark-chilling conditions.These results provide a new perspective on the mechanisms involving photosynthetic complexes while efficiently operating in the darkness.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPlant growing conditions and dark-chilling treatment\n\nRunner bean (Phaseolus coccineus L. cv.Eureka) plants (seeds from PlantiCo Zielonki, 05-082 Babice Stare, Poland) were grown in perlite-containing pots in a climate-controlled room in 16 h day/8 h night photoperiod (21 °C day/20°C night) at PAR of 200 µmol photons m − 2 s − 1 until fully grown.Fully expanded primary leaves of 10 days-old plants were collected at the end of the night period before the light was turned on.Dark-chilling treatment was applied as described before [37].In short, detached leaves were placed in Dewar flasks (4 °C, 100% relative humidity) for three days.For control conditions plants were kept in darkness at 21 °C for three days (dark) or in a growth chamber in day/night cycle conditions (light).\n\nPreparation of leaf protein extracts, thylakoid membranes, and thylakoid fractions\n\nAround 150 mg of leaf samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground in a mortar to a powder, and transferred to the extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 25 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), mixed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.Frozen samples were placed in an ultrasonic bath at 4 °C until complete melting, then frozen again.Three freezing-thawing cycles were performed, then samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g to remove non-soluble material.Protein concentration in the supernatant was estimated according to the modified Lowry method using BioRad DC Protein Assay (#5000111).\n\nThylakoid membranes were isolated as described previously [38].Leaves were ground in a Warring homogenizer in 20 mM Tricine-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 330 mM sorbitol, 40 mM ascorbic acid, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM NaF.The homogenate was filtered through Miracloth and the filtrate was centrifuged for 4 min at 2000 g.The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet of chloroplasts was subjected to osmotic shock by suspending in 20 mM Tricine-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM NaF followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 g.The resulting pellet of thylakoid membranes was suspended in 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 330 mM sorbitol, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM NaF and centrifuged again for 10 min at 6000 g.The pellet containing thylakoid membranes was suspended in a Potter-Elvenhjem homogenizer in a small volume of the same buffer.The concentration of chlorophyll (Chl) was quantified on a spectrophotometer using 80% (v/v) acetone extracts [39].\n\nTo separate thylakoid fractions the modified protocols described by Barber et al. [40] and Fristedt et al. [41] were used.Thylakoid samples were diluted in 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 330 mM sorbitol, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM NaF to 60 µg Chl mL − 1 concentration and 4% (w/v) digitonin was added to 0.11% (w/v) final concentration [40].Samples were incubated in dark for 30 min at 4 °C with mild shaking [40], then centrifuged at 1000 g at 4 °C for 5 min in order to remove non-solubilized thylakoids [41].The supernatant was diluted 6 times in the buffer described above and centrifuged at 40 000 g at 4 °C for 30 min [41].The pellet containing stacked membranes corresponding to the so-called grana fraction (grana core and grana margins) was re-suspended in a small amount of dilution buffer, while the supernatant was centrifuged again at 100 000 g at 4 °C for 2 h.The pellet containing stroma lamellae fraction was re-suspended in a small amount of dilution buffer, and Chl content in both grana and stroma lamellae samples was assessed using 80% (v/v) acetone extracts.\n\nSDS PAGE and immunoblotting\n\nSamples containing 10 µg of protein/1 µg of Chl were denatured in Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 75 °C, loaded onto polyacrylamide gels and separated by the standard SDS PAGE protocol using Tris-glycine running buffer.Proteins were transferred for 45 min at 100 V onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane in a buffer consisting of 192 mM glycine, 10% (v/v) methanol, and 25 mM Tris (pH 8.3).Membranes were blocked in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 M NaCl buffer (TBS) with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with TBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden; list of used primary antibodies with catalog numbers is given in Table S1) diluted in TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), accordingly to the manufacturer's instructions.The next day, membranes were washed 4 times in TBST and incubated with anti-rabbit HRP-conjugate secondary antibody (Agrisera Catalog Number AS09 602) for 1 h at room temperature.Visualization was obtained by using ECL Bright (Agrisera Catalog Number AS16 ECL-N-100).\n\nTwo layer Phos-Tag™ SDS PAGE\n\nTwo-layer Phos-Tag™ SDS PAGE was performed according to the method of Longoni et al [42].Two-layer separating gels solutions were prepared: (i) heavy gel solution: 357 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.8), 7% (w/v) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (37.5:1), 30% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (v/v) N, N,N' ,N'tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED); (ii) light gel solution: 357 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.8), 8% (w/v) acrylamide/ bis-acrylamide (37.5:1), 60 µM Phos-tag™ (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Japan), 0.01% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 0.05% (v/v) TEMED, 0.05% (w/v) APS.Three volumes of heavy solution were poured between the gel plates, followed by one volume of light solution.After polymerization, the stacking gel was prepared: 357 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (37.5:1), 0.1% (v/v) TEMED, 0.05% (w/v) APS.\n\nThylakoid samples were incubated for 5 min at 70 °C in a loading buffer containing 244 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.5), 2% (w/v) LDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mM DTT, 0.33 mM Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.One µg of Chl was loaded per well.Electrophoresis was carried out with freshly prepared running buffer (61 mM Tris, 50 mM MOPS, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 5 mM sodium bisulfite) at 55 V for 4.5 h.Then proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane in a buffer consisting of 25 mM Bis-Tris, 25 mM Bicine, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) methanol, 5 mM sodium bisulfite; pH 7.2, for 16.5 h at 150 mA at 4 °C.The membranes were blocked in TBS buffer containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 40 min with agitation, then dephosphorylated by incubation with 400 U mL − 1 of λ protein phosphatase (New England BioLabs, catalog number P0753L), 2 mM MnCl 2 , 2 mM DTT in a blocking solution for 4 h in room temperature.The membranes were then washed with TBS and incubated with primary antibodies against Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 (Agrisera) diluted in TBST accordingly to the manufacturer's instructions.Further steps of immunodetection were performed as described above.Phosphorylation level was calculated as [P/(P + NP)] × 100% (P, phosphoprotein; NP, unphosphorylated protein) and normalized to 0% at time point 0 h (i.e. the % of phosphorylation at 0 h was subtracted from data for all time points).\n\nBlue native PAGE and 2D electrophoresis\n\nBlue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) was performed according to Rogowski et al. [43] with some modifications.Thylakoid samples (45 µg Chl) were centrifuged at 7000 g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 25 mM Imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0) and 20% glycerol.Thylakoid membrane proteins were solubilized by the addition of n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) to a final concentration of 1% (w/v).Samples were shaken vigorously and centrifuged at 18 000 g for 15 min at 4 °C.Sample buffer (50 mM Imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 125 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid, 30% (w/v) sucrose, 5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 20%.The sample was loaded directly onto the gel (4-10% acrylamide, 4-15% sucrose gradient).Electrophoresis was performed overnight at constant 85 V at 4 °C using cathode buffer (50 mM Tricine, 7.5 mM Imidazole, 0.02% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250) and anode buffer (25 mM Imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0).Alternatively, thylakoid membrane proteins were solubilized in 1% (w/v) digitonin during 5 min in dark at 20 °C with gentle mixing [44]; other steps were the same as for DDM.\n\nBands cut out from Blue Native PAGE gels were denatured in 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 M urea, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (w/v) SDS, and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol for 15 min at room temperature followed by 15 min at 50 °C.Water-washed bands were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels, sealed with 1% (w/v) agarose, and separated by the standard SDS PAGE protocol using Tris-glycine running buffer.Gels were silver-stained according to [45].\n\nProtein digestion and LC-MS/MS\n\nSilver-stained bands were excised, de-stained with 15 mM potassium hexacyanoferrate (III), 50 mM sodium thiosulphate solution, and subjected to in-gel protease digestion using trypsin in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 30 °C.After extraction from gel pieces, peptides were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator, dissolved in 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 5% (v/v) acetonitrile mixture, and separated using a nanoAcquity Ultra Performance LC system connected to a Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters).Peptides were trapped on Symmetry® C18 (5 μm; 180 μm × 20 mm) column (Waters) and separated on a BEH 130 C18 analytical column (1.7 μm; 75 μm × 200 mm) (Waters).The elution was performed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid.Protein identification was performed using ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS version 2.4) software (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).\n\nLow-temperature chlorophyll a fluorescence (77 K) measurements\n\nSteady-state fluorescence emission spectra of Chl at low temperature (77 K) were collected using a modified Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer as described previously [20].Thylakoid membranes were diluted to 10 µg Chl mL − 1 concentration, placed in a polytetrafluoroethylene cuvette, and submerged in liquid nitrogen.The excitation wavelength was set at 440 nm, excitation, and emission slits at 5 nm, and scans were taken in the range of 600 to 800 nm (1 nm interval) through the LP600 emission filter.\n\nIn vivo Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements\n\nThe slow kinetics of Q A reduction was measured in RT using a Dual PAM 100 fluorometer (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) in the presence of blue measuring light of intensity below 0.5 µmol photons m -2 s -1 and red actinic light of 3 µmol photons m -2 s -1 intensity during one minute.PSII fluorescence increases, when there is a lack of downstream electron acceptors; so when the PQ pool is highly reduced, it cannot accept electrons from Q A , which results in an increased PSII fluorescence.\n\nNon-photochemical PQ reduction activity was measured according to [46] with some modifications using the Maxi version of the PAM-Imaging system.After F 0 and F M determination and 60 s dark recovery the blue actinic light of 390 µmol photons m -2 s -1 intensity was on for 5 min.Then the actinic light was turned off and the signal was monitored for 5 min more.An increase of Chl a fluorescence level in the dark was an indicator of non-photochemical PQ reduction.\n\nPhotosynthetic complex quantification\n\nPhotosynthetic complex quantification was carried out as described by [47].Thylakoid samples (50 µg Chl mL − 1 ) were destacked by incubation for at least 10 min with 0.03% (w/v) DDM.Then, 1 mM potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) was added to fully oxidize all cytochromes.After that, the high-potential form of cyt b 559 and cytochrome f were reduced by incubation with 10 mM sodium ascorbate.Then, 10 mM sodium dithionite was added to reduce the low potential form of cyt b 559 and the two b-type hemes of cytochrome b 6 .At each of the three redox potentials, absorbance spectra were measured using a V-550 spectrophotometer equipped with a head-on photomultiplier (Jasco GmbH).Spectra were measured between 540 and 575 nm, 1 nm spectral bandwidth, and 100 nm min -1 scanning speed.Average from ten spectra per redox condition was used to calculate difference spectra: the hexacyanoferrate spectrum was subtracted from the ascorbate spectrum, and the ascorbate spectrum was subtracted from the dithionite spectrum, respectively, and baseline was subtracted from spectra.Finally, the difference spectra were deconvoluted using reference spectra, and the contents of PSII and the cyt b 6 f were determined as described by [48].\n\nPSI content was calculated from light-induced difference absorbance changes of P700.Thylakoid samples (50 µg Chl mL − 1 ) were destacked by incubation with 0.2% (w/v) DDM.Then, the electron donor (10 mM sodium ascorbate) and electron acceptor (100 µM methyl viologen) were added, and a light pulse of 250 ms (2000 µmol photons m -2 s -1 ) was applied.P700 photo-oxidation was measured using the Pc-P 700 version of the Dual-PAM instrument (Heinz Walz GmbH).\n\nTransmission electron microscopy\n\nFor transmission electron microscopy samples of 3 mm 2 were cut from the middle parts of the leaves and prepared as described previously [49].The 70 nm thick sections were examined with a JEM 1400 electron microscope (Jeol, Japan) equipped with Morada G2 (EMSIS GmbH) CCD camera in the Laboratory of Electron Microscopy, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of PAS (Warsaw, Poland).\n\nMetabolites analysis PQ and PQH 2\n\nPrenyl lipid fraction (containing PQ and PQH 2 ) was extracted and analyzed as described by [50].Samples containing 200-300 mg of leaf were ground in cooled to -20 °C ethyl acetate.Extracts were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, evaporated under an argon stream, and stored at -80 °C for a maximum of two weeks before analysis.Extracts were separated using the Shimadzu Prominence HPLC System with Beckman Coulter ODS analytical column (5 μm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm).Right before separation samples were reconstituted in 400 µL of methanol: hexane (340:20, v/v) mixture, centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 s, and the 100 µL of supernatant was injected into Rheodyne™ 7725i sample injector.Isocratic separation was performed using methanol: hexane (340:20, v/v) at 30 °C and mobile phase flow of 1.5 mL min − 1 for 40 min.Elution was monitored with SPD-M20A PDA detector (1.2 nm spectral resolution) and RF-10 A XL fluorescence (Ex 290 nm, Em 330 nm) detector.PQ and PQH 2 contents were calculated based on peak areas extracted from chromatograms (absorption at 255 nm for PQ, fluorescence for PQH 2 ) and comparison with prepared standards.PQ and PQH 2 standards concentration were calculated spectrophotometrically using absorption coefficients: PQ ε 255 = 17.94 mM − 1 cm − 1 ; PQH 2 ε 290 = 3.39 mM − 1 cm − 1 ; % of PQ reduction was calculated using following formula: PQ red = [PQH 2 / (PQ + PQH 2 )] × 100%.\n\nStarch\n\nStarch content was quantified using the protocol of [51].Leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen, transferred to 80% (v/v) ethanol, and incubated at 100 °C for 3 min.Leaf tissue was then sedimented at 9 000 g for 5 min.The supernatant was discarded and ethanol extraction was repeated twice more.Pellet was homogenized in distilled water, then heated at 100 °C for 10 min.200 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 6 units of α -amyloglucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.No. 10115), and 1.5 units of α-amylase (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.No. A6380) were added to cooled homogenate and samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight.Then samples were assayed for glucose using an enzymatic assay with hexokinase (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.No. H4502) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.No. G6378).NADPH production was measured at 340 nm on a Cary50Bio spectrophotometer.\n\nNADPH/NADP +\n\nPyridine nucleotides were extracted from leaf tissue as described by [52].Briefly, tissues were homogenized with 0.1 M HCl (oxidized form of nucleotides) or 0.1 M NaOH (reduced form of nucleotides) in 50% (v/v) ethanol.Alkaline extracts were heated at 65 °C for 15 min and then cooled on ice.The homogenates were centrifuged at 14 000 g for 20 min at 4 °C.Phosphorylated pyridine nucleotides concentration in extracts was measured in 60 mM Bicine (pH 7.8) by enzymatic cycling reaction according to [53 and references therein] with spectrophotometric detection and the results were quantitated by comparison with a standard curve.\n\nEnzyme activity measurements\n\nOPPP enzyme activities were measured according to the method of [54].Leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen, and samples were extracted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 0.1 mM benzamidine.Homogenates were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 °C.Supernatants were immediately used to measure enzyme activity.The 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) activity was measured in a reaction buffer consisting of 100 mM HEPES, 0.4 mM NADP + , and 3 mM 6-phosphogluconic acid.The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity was measured in a buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4 mM NADP + , and 2 mM glucose 6-phosphate.NADPH production was monitored at 340 nm using a Cary50Bio spectrophotometer.\n\nRT-qPCR analysis\n\nLeaves were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen.RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's instructions and treated with DNase 1 (Thermo Scientific).Reverse transcription was performed on 1 µg of RNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific).The resulting cDNA was diluted 10-fold with water and 1 µL of the sample was assayed by qPCR in a Step One Plus device (Applied Biosystems) using GoTaq® qPCR Master Mix (Promega) and specific pairs of primers (Table S2).To design primers for NTRC fragment amplification from runner bean the AT2G41680 cds nucleotide sequence was blast against the Phaseolus vulgaris genome and the Phvul.007G251800(XM_007145532.1)sequence was selected to design primers.Four primer pairs covering different exon junctions were tested by RT-qPCR giving the same results of NTRC gene expression in runner bean and one of them was selected for further detailed analyses (Table S2).The relative expression level of NTRC was calculated using the delta-delta Ct method and normalized to the housekeeping genes PvSkip16 (Phvul.011G053400),and PvIDE (Phvul.001G133200)according to [55].Four independent biological replicates were performed using leaves from 3 to 4 plants per sample.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe statistical significance was verified by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test at p = 0.05.The number of repetitions of specific experiments is given in the figure legends.\n\nResults\n\nDark-chilling induces phosphorylation of LHCII proteins in runner bean\n\nThis work focuses on deciphering the biochemical mechanism of the dark-chilling-induced increase in LHCII phosphorylation observed in runner bean.We started with detailed analysis of changes in phosphorylation of two major LHCII proteins: Lhcb1 and Lhcb2, to establish the kinetics of this process using a two-layer PhosTag™ SDS PAGE (Fig. 1).The advantage of this approach is the slower migration of phosphorylated proteins during electrophoresis, which results in the separation of two protein pools, visible as separate bands: phosphoproteins and unphosphorylated proteins on the same Western blot [e.g.42], (Fig. 1A).Under dark-chilling conditions in runner bean, a vast increase in phosphorylation of both Lhcb1 (Fig. 1B) and Lhcb2 (Fig. 1C) proteins was observed.The maximum level of phosphorylation was reached after 9 h of dark-chilling for both proteins, and after 24 h returned to the level from the beginning of the experiment (0 h) (Fig. 1B, C).Lhcb2 reached a higher level of phosphorylation (37%), when compared to Lhcb1 (28%), however, the difference in phosphorylation levels of those two proteins on light is significantly higher (22% and 46%, respectively) as was also reported before [42,56].At the end of the night period in our experimental model (0 h), 9.6 ± 5.6% of Lhcb1 and 13.6 ± 8.3% of Lhcb2 proteins were phosphorylated in the runner bean's thylakoids.These values represents the phosphorylation level without normalization described in Materials and methods section.Because most changes in LHCII phosphorylation were observed during the first 24 h of darkchilling, we narrowed down the time frame to 24 h.\n\nPhosphorylated LHCII associates with PSI-LHCI complex in grana and stroma lamellae fractions under dark-chilling\n\nIn the next step, we evaluated if dark phosphorylated LHCII builds the PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex as observed during light-induced state transitions.\n\nLow-temperature fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2) of control light conditions samples showed a decreased contribution of LHCII trimers (a negative band at a difference spectra with a maximum at 680 nm) and an increased contribution of PSI (a positive band at a difference spectra with a maximum shifted to around 735 nm) already after 3 h of illumination and maintained on light.Similar observation was detected in dark-chilling samples after 9 and 12 h of dark-chilling (Fig. 2C, D).This effect is commonly attributed to the increased PSI antenna cross-section due to the P-LHCII trimer association [2].In contrast, under dark conditions in control temperature we did not observe the decrease in the signal associated with LHCII-PSII complex (Fig. 2E, F).\n\nTo confirm the presence of PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex in dark-chilled runner bean we performed Blue Native electrophoresis.We observed no significant changes in the number of supercomplexes, PSII dimers, or LHCII content (Fig. S1).However, we observed the increase of abundance of a band, located just below the PSII-LHCII supercomplexes section, under dark-chilling and light control, but not under dark conditions (Fig. 3A, Fig. S1).Changes were calculated as P/(P + NP) and normalized to 0% at time point 0 h.Data are mean values ± SD from three to five independent experiments.For control conditions plants were kept in darkness at 21 °C for three days (dark) or in a growth chamber in day/night cycle conditions (light).Results marked with hash, dollar, and ampersand differ significantly at p = 0.05 (one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test) between dark-chilling vs. light, dark-chilling vs. dark, and light vs. dark conditions, respectively\n\nThe new supercomplex was most abundant after 3 h of light control and 9 h of dark-chilling (Fig. S1).Detailed analysis of the new band's composition was performed using two-dimensional electrophoresis, Western-blot, and mass spectrometry (Fig. 3B, Table S3).We confirmed that it is composed not only of PSI proteins: PsaA, PsaD, PsaF, Lhca2, but also of PSII antennae: Lhcb1 and Lhcb2, both in phosphorylated form (Fig. 3B).These results show that dark-chilling induces the formation of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex in runner bean, confirmed both by DDM and digitonin digestion of thylakoids membranes (Fig. 3, S2).Comparative two-dimensional electrophoresis of the BN gel region corresponding to PSI-LHCI-LHCII position for all experimental variants after 9 h of the experiment confirmed its presence in runner bean under dark-chilling and light control conditions only.Moreover, the protein composition of the detected supercomplex was identical indicating the same organization in light and after dark chilling (Fig. 3C).\n\nWe further assessed the lateral location of the newly formed PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex in the thylakoid membranes, by performing digitonin fractionation of total thylakoids followed by electrophoretic and spectroscopic analysis of obtained grana and stroma lamellae thylakoid fractions (Fig. 4).We have selected two experimental time points: (i) 9 h, when the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex was the most abundant, and (ii) 72 h, the last time point of the experiment, to verify whether the complex is still present in the thylakoid membrane.Obtained fractions' purity was confirmed by SDS PAGE and Western blot (Fig. S3).PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex was present in grana and stroma lamellae fractions after 9 h and 72 h of dark-chilling (Fig. 4A).PSI-LHCI-LHCII presence was consistent with the presence of phosphorylated Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 registered in fractionated samples (Fig. 4B, C).Note that in Fig. 1 LHCII protein phosphorylation after 72 h of dark-chilling was significantly lower than after 9 h time-point (Fig. 1).Although plants were growing in controlled conditions observed discrepancy in phosphorylation status at 72 h time point strongly correlates with the season of cultivation; i.e., only plants grown outside the natural vegetative period of beans (late fall to spring) were characterized by high phosphorylation at 72 h of dark-chilling.Latest studies indicate that seasonal internal clock of plants can influence their growth [57], however, in the context of LHCII protein phosphorylation status it requires further investigation.\n\nThe lower Chl a/b ratio in stroma lamellae fraction after 9 h of dark-chilling (Fig. 4D) suggested the enrichment of stroma lamellae with Chl b-containing complexes -most likely LHCII.Low-temperature fluorescence spectra of grana fraction showed the decreased contribution of LHCII trimers (680 nm) and increased  S3) and immunodetection.C -Comparison of the protein composition of BN gel area related to PSI-LHCI-LHCII in runner bean thylakoids isolated after 9 h of all experimental treatments (the image of BN gel below dashed line was squeezed to fit the page).The presented gels and blots are representative of two independent experiments contribution of LHCI (735 nm) (Fig. 4E), similar to intact runner bean's thylakoids (Fig. 2B).An opposite effect was observed for stroma lamellae, where the contribution of LHCII trimers increased and the contribution of LHCI decreased (Fig. 4E).\n\nPhotosynthetic complexes stoichiometry under darkchilling\n\nSpectroscopic analysis of total thylakoid fractions showed that chlorophyll a/b ratio in runner bean was higher after 9 h of dark-chilling (Table 1).However, this effect was only temporary -after 72 h of dark-chilling, Chl a/b ratio returned to the start point value (Table 1).No significant changes in PSII content were observed for runner bean from dark and dark-chilling conditions.PSI quantification showed a reduction in functional P700 content after 72 h of dark-chilling and dark in runner bean (Table 1).\n\nSTN7 kinase activation under dark-chilling conditions\n\nTo establish the pathway of STN7 kinase activation under dark-chilling conditions, we performed several complementary spectroscopic and biochemical analyses (Figs. 5  and 6).Since STN7 activation on light requires a reduced PQ pool, in the first step we analyzed whether such conditions i.e. increase in PQ pool reduction, are also present in dark-chilled runner bean plants.\n\nWe started with the analysis of the total leaf PQ and PQH 2 contents by means of HPLC (Fig. 5A-C).In runner bean, we showed a slight, almost linear, increase of  PQ reduction from 40 to 50% of the total PQ pool during 12 h of dark-chilling conditions (Fig. 5C).Similar pattern was also observed in dark conditions (Fig. 5C).The PQ reduction in the dark-chilling and dark conditions was between 60 and 75% of the maximal light-induced level (Fig. 5C).Further, we measured the slow kinetics of Chl a fluorescence to verify changes in the reduction status of the photoactive PQ pool, in runner bean leaves under  E), and 7-24 (panel G) replicates from two independent experiments.Results marked with an asterisk (dark-chilling) and hash (dark) differ significantly from time-point 0 h at p = 0.05 (one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test), while these marked with dollar differ significantly between darkchilling vs. dark within single time point dark-chilling and dark conditions (Fig. 5D-E, S5A-B).This is since only the photoactive PQ pool can activate STN7.Slow kinetic fluorescence traces analysis revealed that in runner bean the reduced PQ pool increased gradually up to 9 h of dark-chilling (Fig. 5E).In contrast such an effect was not observed in dark conditions (Fig. 5E).The highest noted value of reduced PQ pool in runner bean was in line with the peak level of LHCII phosphorylation, observed after 9 h of dark-chilling (Fig. 1B,  C).To reveal whether the increase of the reduction of PQ pool in the dark-chilled runner bean is directly related to the dark-operating NDH and/or ferredoxin: quinone reductase (FQR) enzymes [46], we measured the nonphotochemical reduction of the PQ pool using in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence approach (Fig. 5F-G, S5C-D).Since the non-photochemical reduction of PQ is possible under dark-chilling and dark conditions (Fig. 5G), results suggest that in runner bean the activities of FQR and/or NDH were present under both experimental conditions.\n\nFQR and NDH activities depend (directly or indirectly) on the availability of reduced NADPH, thus to establish further steps of STN7 activation in the darkness we tested NADPH and NADP + contents (Fig. 6A).We observed a quite steady NADPH/NADP + ratio during 9 h of dark-chilling with slight decrease after 12 h of dark-chilling.In dark conditions the NADPH/NADP + ratio is similar to those in dark-chilling except the 9 h where transient increase was observed (Fig. 6A).The lack of expected NADPH accumulation in runner bean under dark-chilling might be caused by the instant usage of this reducing force.\n\nIt is well known that NADPH in the chloroplast in the dark is produced by OPPP glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) enzymes [58] and their substrates can be supplied from starch degradation pathway [59].Therefore, we showed that in runner bean there was a transient increase in the activities of both G6PDH and 6PGDH after 3 h of dark-chilling (Fig. 6B, C).Further, we detected an almost 3-fold increase in starch content in runner bean leaves after 3 h of dark-chilling, with the second smaller peak after 9 h of treatment (Fig. 6D).On the contrary, a constant decrease in starch content in dark-treated runner bean was observed (Fig. 6D).Such biochemical observations were confirmed by electron microscopy analysis in which starch accumulation was assessed qualitatively (Fig. 6E).\n\nOur next question regarded the elucidation of the darkchilling induced starch accumulation pathway as the next detected important upstream step in STN7 kinase activation.Since Pérez-Ruiz et al. [31] showed that the NTRC enzyme is operating under dark conditions and activates both ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), a key starch synthesis enzyme [60], and NDH, a source of nonphotochemically reduced PQ [32], we decided to test NTRC protein and transcript levels in our experimental setup (Fig. 7).Under dark-chilling of runner bean plants the NTRC protein level was stable during 12 h with a transient drop after 9 h (Fig. 7B).On the contrary, dark conditions induced more visible fluctuations of NTRC level, with a decrease after 3 h and an increase after 9 h (Fig. 7B).Expression analysis of NTRC transcript showed some fluctuations during 12 h under both experimental conditions, however without significant differences (Fig. 7C).We suspect that the lack of NTRC protein level decrease in dark-chilling compared with dark conditions at 3 h of the experimental treatment might be responsible for observed starch accumulation in the runner bean.\n\nDiscussion\n\nLow temperature is one of the common stress factors which affects plant growth, especially in the temperate climate zone, where during the spring season high daily fluctuations of temperature are observed.Such conditions activate a plethora of recognized as well as not yet identified metabolic responses.However, the exact biochemical mechanisms, even for already described responses, are not fully understood.\n\nIn this work, we decipher the mechanism of darkchilling-induced LHCII phosphorylation, the phenomenon which we reported in our previous study [15,20].Moreover, we indicate the implications of P-LHCII level on the supramolecular organization of photosynthetic complexes.We started with tracking the time resolved phosphorylation pattern in the runner bean plants, and showed that the LHCII phosphorylation level increases up to 35% of the total LHCII fraction after 9 h of darkchilling conditions.This value is comparable to the one obtained in light conditions for the studied species (Fig. 1).\n\nRole of LHCII phosphorylation in a reorganization of CP complexes and thylakoid membrane spatial structure under dark-chilling\n\nLHCII phosphorylation, usually related to light-induced state transition, causes the reorganization of photosynthetic complexes [reviewed in 61].We observed the formation of state 2 characteristic PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex in runner bean in light and under dark-chilling conditions (Fig. 3).Detailed membrane fractionation analysis demonstrated the presence of P-LHCII and PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex both in grana and stroma lamella fractions isolated from dark-chilled runner bean leaves (Fig. 4), indicating that not all P-LHCII are mobile in terms of long-range grana -stroma lamellae distance.This is in line with recent research, postulating the presence of two spatially separated pools of LHCII with limited mobility [11,12].In stroma lamellae fraction isolated from dark-chilling, we observed the increase of 77 K fluorescence signal below 700 nm (Fig. 4E), a slight decrease in Chl a/b ratio (Fig. 4D), and an increase of total LHCII content (Fig. S4).These suggest the migration of a fraction of P-LHCII pool outside grana membranes.Interestingly, there is no evidence for partial unstacking of grana marginal regions under dark-chilling (Fig. S6), postulated as a necessary step of LHCII migration outside the grana [62,63].It means, that the P-LHCII relocation to the stroma lamellae can be achieved without major membrane reconfigurations as shown by Verhoeven et al. using the single chloroplast in folio fluorescence imaging [64].Therefore, we speculate that the magnitude of P-LHCII grana to stroma migration might depend on the species-specific organization of grana stacks in which the ratio of end-to stacked membranes can vary significantly [65]\n\nPathway leading to LHCII phosphorylation under darkchilling\n\nIn control light conditions the LHCII phosphorylation in runner bean reaches maximal level after 6 h of illumination (Fig. 1).Under dark-chilling this process is much slower, starts between 3rd and 6th h, and reaches a maximum after 9 h (Fig. 1).Therefore, it can be presumed that the pathway activating STN7 kinase in darkchilling conditions contains additional steps as compared with light activation.In this work we focused on deciphering the steps of this process, revealing the putative mechanism of dark-chilling-induced LHCII phosphorylation.The proposed model of the STN7 kinase activation mechanism in runner bean under dark-chilling conditions based on the results provided in this work is summed up in Fig. 8.\n\nIn detail, after 3 h of dark-chilling, a significant shortlasting increase in the activities of two OPPP enzymes: G6PDH and 6PGDH was observed (Fig. 6B, C).The activity of OPPP enzymes is a well-known source of NADPH in the dark [58].NADPH generated in the OPPP was shown to reduce, i.e. activate, NTRC in the dark [31,32].Despite observed OPPP enzyme activation, we did not register significant NADPH accumulation suggesting increased NADPH usage in dark-chilled samples (Fig. 6A-C).However, we analyzed the NTRC transcript and protein levels as well as the downstream effects of NTRC activity.At three hours of dark-chilling we detected significantly higher NTRC protein level comparing with dark conditions (Fig. 7B).Simultaneously, we observed the NTRC activity manifestation in runner bean as the induction of starch synthesis, which occurred after 3 and 9 h of dark-chilling (Fig. 6D).Darkactivation of AGPase, a key enzyme of the starch biosynthesis pathway, was demonstrated to be executed in the dark by NTRC [60,66].The increased AGPase activity and starch accumulation in response to chilling stress was observed in the maize line [67] and, similarly to our experiments, the starch formation was detected also in tomato [68] and cucumber cotyledons [69] under chilling and dark-chilling conditions, respectively.Starch synthesis occurring in runner bean in dark-chilling conditions was confirmed by two independent methods -TEM and biochemical assay (Fig. 6D, E).However, the source of sugars necessary for starch synthesis in the dark-chilling conditions remains to be discovered.\n\nSince the NTRC activity was shown to enhance the NDH-dependent cyclic electron flow which increases the reduced PQ pool [32], we also investigated the non-photochemical reduction of PQ.Since cyclic electron flow mediated by NDH was shown to be enhanced by cold stress [70], the NDH pathway probably has a Fig. 8 Proposed pathway of the light-independent STN7 kinase activation in runner bean plants in response to dark-chilling.A -Graphs showing the magnitude of selected metabolic processes presented on the time scale of dark-chilling exposure of runner bean.Data were taken from Figs. 1, 3 and 5-7 and normalized to 1 and 0 at maximal and minimal values, respectively.B -Scheme of the pathway leading to the light-independent activation of STN7 kinase and LHCII phosphorylation in runner bean; numbers show the order of events.The proposed pathway starts with dark-chilling induced (1) activation of OPPP enzymes (2).NADPH produced by OPPP enzymes activates NTRC (3), which then triggers AGPase (4), resulting in starch synthesis (4').The subsequent target of NTRC is thylakoid membrane-located NDH (5), which activity transfers electrons to the PQ pool, causing its reduction (6) -this process is delayed compared to starch synthesis.Increased reduction of the PQ pool triggers STN7 kinase (7), resulting in LHCII phosphorylation (8) and finally, state transitions (9).Note that not all of proposed pathway elements were confirmed experimentally.Elements of the scheme showed in gray represent speculative parts of the proposed mechanism predominant role in the nonphotochemical reduction of PQ in the dark-chilling.\n\nIn runner bean, we detected the gradual increase in reduced PQ pool with the maximum after 9 h of dark-chilling (Fig. 5E).In this time point, the significant increases in nonphotochemically reduced PQ pool (Fig. 5G) and LHCII phosphorylation (Fig. 1) were detected.The enhanced reduction of the PQ pool in stress conditions was already noted for rice growing under light-chilling [71].However, our results indicate that this effect is also present under dark-chilling when the PSII-driven PQ reduction is inactive.Therefore, the nonphotochemical reduction of PQ, resulting from the activation of metabolic pathways in the chloroplast stroma in which NTRC plays a pivotal role, might be the final step triggering STN7 kinase activation in runner bean under dark-chilling conditions.\n\nSummarizing, we distinguish two proposed stages of studied mechanism.First proposed stage includes OPPP activation (Fig. 8B, arrows 1-2), possible NTRC and AGPase activation (Fig. 8B, arrows 3-4) and confirmed starch accumulation (Fig. 8B, arrow 4').This stage occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts and is associated with diffusion in the aqueous solution.It is completed within the first three hours of dark-chilling (Fig. 8A).The proposed second stage occurs inside the thylakoid membrane.It is composed of possible NDH activation (Fig. 8B, arrow 5), PQ pool reduction (Fig. 8B, arrow 6), STN7 kinase activation (Fig. 8B, arrow 7), and finally LHCII phosphorylation (Fig. 8B, arrow 8).The second stage takes place between 3rd and 9th hour (Fig. 8A) of dark-chilling.These lipid bilayer-located processes are slower, compared with stroma-located reactions indicating time separation of two proposed stages of studied mechanism (Fig. 8A).\n\nAlthough in this work, we described the possible mechanism leading to the dark-chilling induced LHCII phosphorylation in detail taking into account also the time course of the following steps, the biological significance of this phenomenon remains puzzling.We can speculate on two competing hypotheses.In the first one, this process is considered an adaptive mechanism by which the runner bean mitigates the negative effects caused by low temperatures.For instance, by maintaining membrane stability in chilling conditions due to the presence of a highly mobile P-LHCII pool [72] and regulation of the cell turgor by starch synthesis/degradation [reviewed in 73] being a part of the studied phenomenon.The second hypothesis assumes that the observed mechanism is one of the metabolic components of runner bean chilling sensitivity by unnecessary activation of various processes (e.g., LHCII phosphorylation and starch accumulation) consuming ATP, that cannot be easily renewed under dark-chilling conditions.Since the biological role of observed effects could be considered from such two completely different perspectives, the clarification of the studied mechanism function requires further investigation also including other chilling sensitive and chilling tolerant species.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this study, we propose the light-independent STN7 kinase activation pathway which operates in runner bean under dark-chilling conditions.Obtained results suggest the direct connection between chloroplast thioredoxin system activity and reorganization of photosynthetic complexes, which sets a new perspective on the photosynthesis regulatory mechanisms able to operate in the absence of light.We showed that dark-chilling causes not only LHCII phosphorylation in runner bean, but also the formation of PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex, typical for light-induced state transitions.We linked the observed effect with the dark-chilling induced metabolic cascade possibly operating through the activation of OPPP, then NTRC-related both starch biosynthesis and nonphotochemical reduction of PQ.In consequence, photosynthetic complexes reorganization in runner bean in dark chilling conditions results from PQ pool-driven STN7 activation, indicating the possible connection between this chloroplast kinase activation and chilling stress response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nAssociation mapping for traits via MLM\n\nThe MLM model was utilised in GWAS research to identify important QTNs related to GR, WSL, and RL. Results highlighted that a total of 4, 9 and 10 QTNs were found to be associated with GR, WSL, and RL, respectively, at a threshold value of − log10P = 4.5 (Table 2 and Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 respectively). Four QTNs associated with GR were mapped on two chromosomes only: Chr.03 and Chr.08. Among these QTNs, two QTN qGR3-1 and qGR8-1 were distributed on Chr.3 and 8 respectively and covered 8.55 to 10.59% phenotypic variation (PV) and they were identified consistently in all three environments (i.e. 2018, 2019 and combined environment) (Table 2, Fig. 4). These QTNs showed significant association with SNP marker Gm03-4741942, Gm08-12368145 and exhibited largest phenotypic variation effect (10.59%) in combined environment. Besides this, qGR3-2 and qGR8-2 were detected in two environments only and they covered 8.99-9.14% of the PV (Table 2). For WSL, a total of 9 QTNs were identified on six different chromosomes i.e. Chr.08, 09, 12, 13, 16 and 18 (Table 2, Fig. 5). Among these, qWSL-8 and qWSL13-1 were found in all the three environments and categorized as stable QTNs linked with WSL. These two QTNs accounted for 8.01%-8.63% phenotypic variations, respectively. Two QTNs linked to WSL viz., qWSL13-2 and qWSL13-3 were identified in two environments and explicated 8.84-9.77% of the PV respectively. However, qWSL-16-1 and qWSL-9-1 were detected during 2018 and 2019, respectively (Table 2). \n\nWe used the MLM approach to identify 10 QTNs in RL, and all these QTNs were located on 5 distinct chromosomes viz., Chr.06, 08, 15, 14 and 16 (Table 2). Out of these QTNs, only qRL-8 and qRL15-4 were continually detected in all environments (2018, 2019 and Combined), elucidating 8.12-9.83% of the PV and these QTNs were linked SNP marker Gm08-12368145 on Chr.08 and Gm15-4497855 on Chr.15, respectively. Other QTNs,    www.nature.com/scientificreports/ qRL16-1 and qRL-14 were detected in 2018 and 2019 environments, explaining 8.14% and 8.49% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. The three remaining QTNs associated with RL were only found in one environment and accounted for 8.08 percent-8.12 percent of the PV (Table 2 and Fig. 6). \n\nAssociation mapping for traits via mrMLM\n\nMulti-locus GWAS analysis was performed by a mrMLM approach to ensure the QTNs dependability detected by the MLM model and to identify further QTNs related with GR, WSL and RL. As shown in Table 2-3, a total of 8, 8 and 11 QTNs were linked with GR, WSL and RL respectively (Table 3). For GR, one QTN qGR8-1 linked with the Gm08-12368145 marker was constantly found in all environments, and this QTN showed broad PV effects ranging from 8.40 to 9.95%. The remaining seven GR QTNs were only found in one environment, accounting for 4.04 to 9.95% of the PV. In case of WSL, 8 QTNs were identified, scattered on 6 different chromosomes. Among them, only single QTN qWSL-13 was mapped in all three environments with larger effect, while qWSL-18 was identified in two environments (2019 and combined). However, the rest of 6 QTNs were identified in single environment only. For RL, a total of eleven QTNs were detected, explaining 3.7-18.6% of the PV. Out of these, qRL-8-1 associated with RL in all environments (2018, 2019 and combined). Two QTNs qRL7-1 and qRL7-2 were observed in two environments (2019 and combined). However, the remaining eight QTNs were environment specific QTNs (Table 3). In short, a total of 23 and 27 QTNs linked with all studied traits of drought tolerance were observed via MLM and mrMLM model, respectively (Tables 2 and 3). \n\nComparison between MLM and mrMLM results\n\nIn comparison with the MLM and mrMLM, For MLM, six QTNs, viz., qGR3-1, qGR8-1, qWSL8, qWSL13-1, qRL-8 and qRL15-4 were detected in all three environments. As predicted, for mrMLM, three major QTN qGR8-1, qWSL13-1 and qRL-8 were linked with GR, WSL and RL were detected. These three critical QTNs were detected by both MLM and mrMLM. Nevertheless, the qGR3-1 and qWSL8-1 detected by MLM could not be confirmed by mrMLM. Furthermore, qRL6 and qRL14 were also detected by both MLM and mrMLM in 2018 and 2019, respectively (Table 3). Based on above mentioned results, two major and stable QTN i.e. qGR8-1(Gm08-12368145), qWSL13-1(Gm13-35394159) and qRL8 (Gm08-12368145) were identified in all studied environments via MLM and mrMLM methods. The QTNs, qRL8 and qGR8-1 were renamed as QTN8. QTN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ qRL15-4 (Gm15-4497855) was identified in all three environments in MLM but not in mrMLM. Thus, these major QTN on Chr.8 and 13 were potentially employed as the hotspot area for fine mapping and analysis of candidate genes linked with drought tolerance in soybean. \n\nCandidate gene prediction\n\nAs the stable QTN found on Chr.08 (QTN8) and Chr.13 (qWSL13-1) were constantly detected in all studied traits i.e. GR, WSL and RL by both methods in all environments. For further confirmation, candidate gene prediction analysis has been conducted in the genomic region adjacent to the QTN8-1 and QTN13-1. Based on LD distance, 500 kb up as well as downstream region carrying peak SNPs markers was explored and within the interval of 1.0 Mb, a total of 100 and 139 genes were mapped on Chr.08 and Chr.13, respectively. The haplotype block analysis was carried out with Haploview 4.2 for all the SNPs located within ± 100 kb candidate region (Fig. 7). \n\nBased on gene annotation data derived from Soybase (http:// www. soyba se. org) and the Phytozome (https:// phyto zome. jgi. doe. gov), 15 genes were identified as possible candidate genes regulating the drought tolerance in soybean (Table2-4). Out of 15 candidate genes, Glyma08g156800, Glyma08g160000, Glyma08g162700 and Glyma13g249600 only showed higher expression in soybean root tissues. \n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, significant diversity has been observed in 240 soybean PIs regarding the GR, WSL and RL values that are three important drought-linked parameters at germination stage. Results depicted that GWAS analysis using 34,817 SNPs detected QTLs related with drought tolerance (Table 2, Table 3). Furthermore, strong positive correlations of r = 0.79 was observed between GR and RL in the 240 soybean PIs (Table 4). Drought stress impairs germination by limiting water imbibition 41 . Therefore, for evaluation of soybean genotypes, we screened the population at germination stage by measuring GR, WSL and RL. On the basis of correlation analysis, it was cleared that WSL showed a positive correlation with GR and RL (Table 4). Two stable QTNs were discovered among the QTNs identified, viz. QTN8, (qGR8-1, qRL-8) and qWSL13-1 were detected in all environments (2018, 2019, and Combined) via MLM, explaining 8.34-10.59% of the PV, whereas these QTNs (QTN8 and qWSL13-1) were also detected by mrMLM. Remarkably, Stable QTN (QTN8) located on Chr.08, was linked with SNP marker Gm08-12368145 for two traits (qGR8-1 and qRL-8), this QTN was discovered in all of the environments examined. Furthermore, mrMLM was used to effectively identify this stable QTN8 on Chr. 8. Another major QTN (qWSL13-1) associated with Gm13-35394159 was detected in all environments (Table 3). Thus, this stable QTN8 detected on Chr.08 in present study is a newly QTN linked with drought-tolerance in soybean. \n\nHowever, the second stable QTNs viz., qWSL13-1 identified via MLM was detected in all environments, was only linked to a single trait. Therefore, on the base of above mentioned results, it is summarized that in this research all the identified stable QTNs were novel for drought tolerance in soybean and mostly carried larger phenotypic effects. Besides this, QTN8 and qWSL13-1 exerted larger phenotypic effects on drought tolerance. That's why, we carried out candidate gene prediction within 1.0 Mb region adjacent to the QTN8/Gm08-12368145 and Gm13-35394159. Based on functional annotations, fifteen candidate genes which are directly or indirectly linked with drought tolerance were selected (Table 5). \n\nUp till now, various studies have been carried out in soybean to explore the genetic mechanism that regulates drought tolerance. Several QTLs linked with drought tolerance have been identified across different environments [42][43][44] . However, most of the research related to QTLs mapping was carried out by employing linkage mapping analysis on the basis of low-density genetic maps. Drought tolerance is a complex character as controlled  by several minor loci with significant environmental influence. To overcome the linkage mapping limitations, LD based GWAS analysis was conducted in this research. Several studies have confirmed that utilization of GWAS analysis could be an alternative and powerful approach for precise detection and defining the genomic regions associated with quantitative traits. Utilization of GWAS is an efficient alternative approach for precise detection and marking the genomic region of loci/genes linked with complex traits 16,45 . Linkage disequilibrium refers to non-random association of SNP alleles that are located at different locus. Nonetheless, the amount of genome-wide LD is critical in GWAS research. As it is influenced by several forces viz., population stratification, linkage, genetic drift, and relatedness 13,46 . For the soybean panel, the LD decay was approximately assessed at 1.76 Mb, which was markedly higher as compared to other plant species i.e. rice (75 kb in indica) 39 , Arabidopsis thaliana (10 kb) 39 and 1.1 kb in sunflower 47 . In the self-pollinated species like soybean comparatively higher LD value has been recorded as compared to cross-pollinated species 48,49 . Furthermore, resequencing of 31 soybean genomes, Lam, Xu, Liu, Chen, Yang, Wong, Li, He, Qin and Wang 37 stated that both cultivated and wild soybean species showed high LD, while the comparison of both species showed that cultivated soybean demonstrated higher LD level than wild species. Therefore, for effective improvement of the genetic variability of GWAS population genotypes should have diverse genetic background (including wild species, cultivars, and landraces) collected from different geographical regions. \n\nFrom previous functionally verified genes, transgenic lines with GmNAC8 overexpression show noticeably greater drought tolerance than those with GmNAC8 deletion, indicating that GmNAC8 is a positive regulator of drought tolerance 50 . GmWRKY54 enhanced drought tolerance by activating genes in the abscisic acid and Ca 2+ signaling pathways from functionally confirmed genes. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of WRKY20 from a wild soybean greatly increased drought tolerance 51,52 . Using a constitutive expression promoter, it was possible to overexpress the LOS5/ABA3 gene in soybeans, encoding the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase, therefore improving drought tolerance and increasing seed output by at least 21% during drought stress 53 . In plants, U-box (PUB) proteins serve as E3 ligases. Under drought stress conditions, the transgenic lines of Arabidopsis showed reduced plant viability when GmPUB6 was overexpressed 54 . \n\nManavalan, Prince, Musket, Chaky, Deshmukh, Vuong, Song, Cregan, Nelson and Shannon 43 has reported one QTN associated with drought tolerance linked with marker Satt315 on Chr.08 within a confidence interval of 15 cm. Depending upon the genomic sequence information, it was found that this QTL was linked with Satt315 from SoyBase (http:// www. soyba se. org), this QTL was present between 6751690 and 6751725 Mb of physical interval on Chr.08. In another study, Abdul Haleem et al. (2011) identified one QTL Q_root_Gm08 (flanked with Satt228 and Satt429 on Gm08) via MLM relevant to the fibrous root system. This QTL was located between 46366169 and 46366092 Mb of physical interval of Chr.08. (QTN8) 55 also reported a cluster of 4 QTL associated with seed and root related traits (RFW, RDW, SFW, and SDW) on LG A2 (chromosome 8). This QTL is linked with marker Satt177 within a confidence interval of 15 cM. Charlson et al. (2009) also identified QTL (Sat_319) on MLG A2 contributed slow-wilting. This QTL was located between 4717934 and 4717907 Mb of physical interval of Chr.08. Wang et al., (2012) also identified QTL (I-Satt327 on G2-A2) controlling drought tolerant traits during germination stage. This QTL was located between 20511527 and 20511574 Mb of physical interval of Chr.08 but the physical position of Gm08-12368145 was 12.36 Mb of Chr.08. \n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPlant materials and field evaluation\n\nAn association mapping population comprised 240 worldwide (Table S2-1) soybean plant introductions (PIs). The collections were obtained from 22 countries across Europe (EU), West Asia and North Africa, East Asia, and the Americas. The list of germplasm accessions and their origins are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Seeds of the 240 germplasm were collected from National Center for Soybean Improvement, Nanjing Agricultural  (1997) with minor changes. Furthermore, the abbreviation was started with 'q' , followed by trait name (GR, germination rate; WSL, whole seedling length; RL, root length) and the chromosome name, succeeded by number of QTN identified on same chromosome. Thus, qGR8-1 designated a locus on chromosome 08 related with GR in all environments. Haplotype block analysis of the comparatively stable SNPs was carried out in Haploview software version 4.2 with default parameters (Barrett et al. 37 . \n\nPrediction of candidate genes\n\nPossible candidate genes were obtained within major QTN region found on Chr.08 and Chr.13 by either single or multi-locus models in the soybean (William 82) gene models 1.0 (Grant et al., 2010). The functional annotations of reference genes were obtained from SoyBase and phytozome and candidate genes were selected manually based on their expression pattern in roots. \n\nConclusions\n\nA total of 23 and 27 QTNs linked with GR, WSL and RL were detected using MLM and mrMLM approaches in all three environments (2018, 2019, and Combined). Among these QTNs, six QTNs, viz., qGR3-1, qGR8-1, qWSL8, qWSL13-1, qRL-8 and qRL15-4 were identified in all three environments via MLM and three of them (qGR8-1, qWSL13-1 and qRL-8) were also detected using mrMLM method. On the base of MLM and mrMLM comparative analysis, the most stable QTN8 was linked with RL and GR and it was confirmed through MLM and mrMLM methods in all environments. Eventually, the 1.0 Mb region around QTN8/ Gm08-12368145 and Gm13-35394159 ± 500 kb was utilized for candidate gene prediction. Based on the expression data, Glyma08g156800, Glyma08g16000, Glyma08g162700 and Glyma13g249600 were regarded as most possible candidate genes which regulate drought tolerance in soybean. Although, functional validation is further needed to define its role in drought tolerance. In short, this study broadens our vision to understand the genetic mechanisms regulating drought tolerance in soybean and it will be helpful in future to breed soybean cultivars with increased drought tolerance via gene cloning and marker assisted selection. \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n    \n\n\n\n     \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   \n",

(2014).A subset of 34,817 SNPs (MAF > 0.05 and missing rates < 0.25) was selected out of 42,449 SNPs for further analyses.Principal component, linkage disequilibrium, and population structure analysisAfter screening using the PLINK in-depth-pairwise command 7358 SNPs were retrieved for this study61.Using the software STRU CTU RE 2.2, a model-based cluster assay was performed to find the genetic structure and define the cluster (gene pools) in the data62.Potential populations (K), the number was from 1 to 10 with four repetitions, and each Q and P-value was estimated.The Delta K method was used to calculate the most likely number of subpopulations63.TASSEL 5.0 software was used to create a neighbor-joining tree (NJT)64.R studio was used to perform principal component analysis (PCA).TASSEL 5.0 was used to estimate Kinship, and further pairwise SNPs linkage disequilibrium (LD) was estimated as a squared correlation coefficient (r 2 ) using RTM-GWASV1.165.The distance of chromosome at which r2 dropped to half of its highest value was used to determine the linkage disequilibrium decay rate.Marker-trait association and haplotype block analysis (GWAS)After eliminating SNPs with an MAF < 5%, 34,817 SNPs were remained for the 240 PIs.To reduce false-positives and enhance statistical performance, the principal component (PC) and kinship (K) matrix were calculated.For the SLM (Single locus model) viz., MLM (PCA + K) was carried out in TASSEL5.2 (Bradbury et al., 2007) while for multi-locus model, mrMLM was conducted in R using mrMLMGUI package (version 2.1)66.A thresholdGermination rate under drought condition Germination rate under normal conditionnr )Author contributionsAuthor contributions: Conceptualization, T.Z, Muqadas Aleem, MHS, M.K.R; Data curation, Maida Aleem., M.K.R, and W.Y; Formal analysis, Muqadas Aleem, M.S.I, I.S, S.A; Investigation, Maida Aleem., W.Y., Z.A, and B.K.; Methodology, T.Z, BK, and Muqadas Aleem; Project administration, T.Z..; Supervision, T.Z.; Writingoriginal draft, Muqadas Aleem, NB and Maida A.

Despite the ample choices, pharmacy students find it difficult to decide on a career path that best matches their aspirations, interests, and goals. Only a few reports in the literature from different countries have described pharmacy students' career preferences [1][2][3][4]. In an earlier survey from 2004 of 509 students from 8 U.S. pharmacy schools, about two-thirds of students aspired to a career in direct patient care settings while the rest aimed at careers in indirect patient care and drug distribution [1]. In a more recent survey from 2023 of 454 pharmacy interns with the majority enrolled in the PharmD programs at 25 pharmacy colleges in Saudi Arabia, students' primary interest was clinical pharmacy followed by the pharmaceutical industry [2]. This is in contrast to an earlier study from 2019 in Saudi Arabia which reported that pharmacy students' first choice was hospital pharmacy, followed by academia and research, while community and industrial pharmacy were the least chosen [4]. In a 2022 report from one pharmacy school in Lebanon, about two-thirds of surveyed students initially considered community or hospital pharmacy, and 60% academic pharmacy [3]. \n\nWhen considering the available data on pharmacy students' career interests, they diverge depending on the geographical location and study design. Such interests are also influenced by different factors such as personal interests, curriculum, experiential learning experiences, financial incentives, job availability, career ladder, and flexible working hours [1][2][3][4]. While the available studies reported on pharmacy students' career interests, none followed up on how students' initial career choices corresponded to their actual career paths. Hence, the primary objective of this study was to compare pharmacy students' initial career choices to their subsequent career paths after they graduated from the program. \n\nMethods\n\nStudy setting\n\nThe School of Pharmacy at the Lebanese American University (LAU) is located in Byblos, Lebanon. It offers a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BS Pharm) degree program that spans 5 years (174 credits) of study and a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree that spans 6 years (201 credits). Students can graduate from the program with a BS Pharm which allows them to apply for pharmacist's registration and become licensed practicing pharmacists in Lebanon, or can proceed for their sixth year to complete their PharmD requirements. On average, about 45% of the BS Pharm class pursues the PharmD year (professional year 4) which consists of the advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) conducted in Lebanon and the U.S. with a primary focus on clinical practice and patient care. The LAU PharmD program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). \n\nThe school provides a 1-credit elective course on career opportunities to second-and third-year professional students (i.e., fourth-and fifth-year students in the pharmacy program, respectively) to increase students' awareness by providing them with guidance on the different career paths. The course includes individual and group assignments on various career and professional topics. One of the course assignments requires that each student write their own career vision by identifying their career of choice and anchoring their interests, goals, values, passion, competencies, strengths, and weaknesses with a plan for realizing their goal. Details of the course have been published elsewhere [5]. \n\nStudy design\n\nThis was a cross-sectional study that followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines [6]. The study included students who were enrolled in the career opportunities course between academic years 2012 and 2019. Data on the initial career choices of students when they were enrolled in the career opportunities course were retrospectively collected from the course records. Collected data were stratified based on students' last terminal degree (i.e., BS Pharm vs. PharmD) upon exiting the school of pharmacy. Information on the subsequent graduates' career paths and graduate or postgraduate education was also retrospectively retrieved from the school records. These data are regularly collected by the school one year after students' graduation using telephone and email surveys (Supplementary file). \n\nData management and analysis\n\nData were entered and tabulated on an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed in Microsoft Excel 2016®. Security codes were assigned to computerized records and codes were used to replace names in order to conceal the identity of the participants. Only the study investigators had access to the identifiable data. Subsequent graduates' career paths were compared to their respective initial career choices identified by students in the career opportunities course. The paths of graduates with a PharmD versus BS Pharm only were also compared. Descriptive statistics were used. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of LAU approved the study. Human Ethics were followed and consent to participate was not required by IRB which determined the study to be exempt from IRB review. All records are kept confidential with access to the data limited only to the investigators. Data documents are stored within locked locations and with restricted access to the investigators only. \n\nThe data were entered into SPSS® (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 27) for statistical analysis. A Chi-Square test was used to assess the association between the career choices and the subsequent career paths and graduate and postgraduate education. The significance level was set at p < 0.05 allowing to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in career distribution between the BS Pharm and PharmD graduates. \n\nResults\n\nCareer paths\n\nA total of 280 students were enrolled in the career opportunities course during the study period. During that period, a total of 430 students graduated from the school with a BS Pharm of whom 204 continued to get their PharmD degree. Therefore, the number of students who were enrolled in the course orresponds to about 65% of the graduating student population. Of these, 109 (38.9%) graduated with a PharmD and 171 (61.1%) with a BS Pharm only. Employment data could not be identified on 66 (23.6%) of the graduates, therefore leaving data available on 214 (76.4%) graduates' subsequent career paths (Table 1). \n\nFor the top initial students' career choices, 101 (36%) selected community pharmacy, 88 (31.4%) clinical pharmacy, and 36 (12.9%) pharmaceutical industry (i.e., product specialist, quality assurance; medical representative; regulatory affairs; brand and marketing manager; drug safety; medical information). For the top subsequent graduates' career paths and out of the 280 students enrolled, 86 (30.7%) worked in the pharmaceutical industry, 50 (17.9%) in community pharmacy, and 22 (7.9%) in clinical pharmacy. When the matching of all of the corresponding career paths to the initial career choices was analyzed, 86 (30.8%) in total matched. These included 33 (11.8%) graduates who matched for community pharmacy, 21 (7.5%) for the pharmaceutical industry, and 15 (5.4%) for clinical pharmacy (Table 1). \n\nThe breakdown analysis of the career paths of PharmD and BS Pharm holders, irrespective of their initial career choices showed the following, respectively: community pharmacy 21 (42%) and 29 (58%), clinical pharmacy 18 (81.8%) and 4 (18.2%), and pharmaceutical industry 25 (29.1%) and 61 (70.9%). The matched career paths to the initial choices of the PharmD and BS Pharm holders showed the following, respectively: community pharmacy 9 (27.3%) and 24 (72.7%), clinical pharmacy 14 (93.3%) and 1 (6.7%), and pharmaceutical industry 6 (28.6%) and 15 (71.4%) (Table 2). The Chi-square test results showed a statistically significant association between career choices and paths based on the terminal degree (p = 0.008). \n\nGraduate and postgraduate education\n\nThe initial career choice and subsequent pursuit of graduate and postgraduate education (i.e., masters, PhD) were analyzed. In total, 49 (17.5%) students initially considered graduate and/or postgraduate education. Of these, 31 (11.1%) graduates ended up pursuing masters and/or PhD. Of those who pursued masters and/or PhD, 8 (25.8%) had a PharmD, and 23 (74.2%) had a BS Pharm only. When the subsequent career paths were compared to the initial career choices, 17 (6.1%) graduates matched with their initial masters and/or PhD choice of whom 4 (23.5%) had a PharmD and 13 (76.5%) had a BS Pharm (Table 3). \n\nThe results of the Chi-Square test showed a statistically significant association between career choice and subsequent pursuit of graduate and postgraduate education (p = 0.031). A higher proportion of BS Pharm as compared to PharmD graduates pursued graduate and postgraduate education (Table 3). \n\nDiscussion\n\nThe decision to pursue pharmacy education is driven by several factors, including personal preference; a desire to improve public health; the influence of family, friends, and educators; income; flexible work hours; and work opportunities [3]. Factors that influence the career aspirations of pharmacy students include income, benefits, stress level, handling multiple tasks, self-actualization, job position flexibility, additional training required, applying knowledge, unique focus, patient care, managerial responsibility, and work schedule flexibility [1][2][3][4]. \n\nCareer paths\n\nIn our study, the top initial choice of students for community pharmacy echoes what was recently reported in a survey of pharmacy students' perspectives on pharmacy education and career aspirations at one school in Lebanon whereby 68% of students were considering community pharmacy [3]. This top-ranked initial choice by students can be explained by several factors that could have influenced their choices. These can include students' prior exposure to community pharmacy practice experiences that occur early in the curriculum, the public visibility of the community sector as the traditional practice setting of pharmacists, in addition to the entrepreneurship and business appeals of this practice model with the possibility of independent pharmacy ownership. Yet, a lower number of graduates landed in community pharmacy than initially considered. While several factors affect one's career path, the labor market plays a significant role in this case. The surplus of community pharmacies and their financial hardships due to Lebanon's economic and financial crises are considerable factors [7][8][9]. The findings of a recent study that assessed pharmacy graduates' career choices in Lebanon further support the interpretation of our study results. In that study, although most pharmacy graduates have worked in a community pharmacy, more than one-half of them did not consider it their preferred career path and expressed dissatisfaction with the financial compensation, stress, and heavy workload [10]. Job dissatisfaction among community-based pharmacists has also been reported in the U.S. for reasons of high workload, work environments, and stress [11,12]. \n\nA top match of our pharmacy graduates' career paths was the pharmaceutical industry. This is one of the historically dominant sectors where pharmacists work in Lebanon [7,13]. Pharmacy graduates in Lebanon who join the pharmaceutical industry mostly work as medical representatives in local and global pharmaceutical companies [14]. The pharmaceutical industry is particularly appealing to pharmacy graduates considering the variety of opportunities that it offers with attractive salaries and incentives [2]. \n\nWhile one-third of our students initially considered clinical pharmacy as a career, only a few of them ended up working as clinical pharmacists. The considerable shift of pharmacy curricula in the country, including our school's program, to emphasize the clinical sciences and patient care may have sparked initial students' interest in clinical pharmacy practice [14]. Such interest has been reported by students at other pharmacy schools in the region [2]. Yet, the low match of career paths in clinical pharmacy to the initial choice is likely due to the limited number of postgraduate pharmacy residency programs in the country that typically prepare graduates for such a role, in addition to the lack of job opportunities for clinical pharmacists in Lebanon.Considering the significant association between career choices and paths based on the terminal degree, this suggests that the distribution of career paths among PharmD and BS Pharm graduates was not due to random chance. The vast majority of those who worked in clinical pharmacy were PharmD graduates as compared to BS Pharm only holders. Conversely, a larger percentage of BS Pharm graduates ended up working in the pharmaceutical industry and community pharmacy. This observation is in agreement with the findings of a recent study whereby fresh PharmD graduates in Lebanon mostly worked in hospitals rather than in other sectors such as medical representatives that were predominantly pursued by BS Pharm holders [10]. \n\nOverall, the subsequent career paths of graduates matched their initial career choices in a little less than one-third of cases. The relatively high mismatch between initial students' career choices and subsequent graduates' career paths is likely influenced by many factors of personal and professional natures. The limited work opportunities and narrow scope of pharmacy practice in Lebanon remain the foremost factors that hinder pharmacy graduates' in pursuing their career aspirations. \n\nGraduate and postgraduate education\n\nThe study findings show a drop in the subsequent pursuit of masters and/or PhD than initially considered with a larger proportion of BS Pharm only graduates, as compared to PharmD holders, pursuing these paths. Yet, these selections based on terminal degree holding were not arbitrary but rather based on an envisioned career path, albeit could have changed as students progressed in the didactic and experiential curricula. In the career opportunities course, graduate and postgraduate education is emphasized in a didactic lecture, students' career vision writing, group presentations on graduate and/or postgraduate programs, as well as in mock interviews [5]. Furthermore, faculty's possible influence on these choices early in the course of study, especially in the foundational sciences that are primarily taught by PhD holders, could have affected students' initial choices. Despite the availability of graduate MS programs available at local universities to pharmacy graduates, a PhD is an uncommon pathway that is primarily considered by those who intend to work in academia and research [15]. Of note, graduates who intend to pursue masters and/or PhD also seek these programs abroad for the broader choices and opportunities they present. \n\nIn Lebanon, a 5-year pharmacy education with a BS Pharm remains the official educational requirement to become a licensed pharmacist and the PharmD is optional. While PharmD graduates appear to have obvious interest in clinical work, BS Pharm only holders interest appear to lie in community and industrial pharmacy with the latter favoring an upgrade of education and skills through graduate programs. This could explain the reason for the larger percentage of BS Pharm graduates who pursued graduate studies. These choices, although they could change throughout the program as students gain more exposure and experience in the curriculum, appear to mostly follow a certain trajectory that yields to the favored and convenient career path. \n\nStudy limitations\n\nLimitations of this study include missing data on the subsequent career paths of 23.6% of graduates. Another limitation is that data were derived from the sample of second-and third-professional year students at one program who were specifically enrolled in the career opportunities elective course. At this stage, there is still students' ongoing exposure to areas of pharmacy practice in the program which can change their earlier vision and ultimate decision about their subsequent career paths. Furthermore, the labor market is a major determining factor in the selection of career paths, and the job opportunities are different between countries which limits the generalizability of our results. Although not generalizable, our overall study findings may still apply to graduates of certain schools and colleges of pharmacy according to different geographical locations and available work opportunities. \n\nConclusions\n\nThe pharmacy profession offers a variety of career opportunities. While pharmacy students' initial career choices are based on their personal and professional goals, interests, and perceptions, their subsequent career paths are not always necessarily aligned with their initial career aspirations. Considering that many factors influence one's career path, pharmacy programs should prepare students for diverse career opportunities in synchrony with the pharmacists' job market as well as the professional and societal needs and expectations of the pharmacy profession. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n",
