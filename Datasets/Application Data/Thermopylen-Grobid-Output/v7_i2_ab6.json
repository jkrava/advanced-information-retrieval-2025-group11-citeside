        "text": "Skills Approach leadership development suggests individuals can develop the skills, abilities, and behaviors needed to lead. However, it can be difficult to understand and apply these theoretical concepts. Movies provide a storytelling platform enabling learners to link theory to practice. This article uses 300 to explore skills-based leadership theories. 300 ( 2007) is an adaptation of Frank Miller's novel depicting the Battle of Thermopylae (400 B.C.) between Greece and Persia. The movie tells the story of how King Leonidas led 300 Spartan warriors in battle against King Xerxes' army in defense of Spartan land, values, and freedom. We provide background on Katz's (1955) and Mumford, Zacaro, Harding, Jacobs, and Fleishman (2000) skills approaches. Then we describe how theoretical concepts associated with these approaches can be found in the movie. Finally, we provide suggestions for experiential learning activities which serve to help participants link and apply theory to practice.",

      "text": "Be an example to your men, in your duty and in private life. Never spare yourself, and let the troops see that you don't in your endurance of fatigue and privation. Always be tactful and well mannered and teach you subordinates to be the same. Avoid excessive sharpness or harshness of voice, which usually indicates the man who has shortcomings of his own to hide. (Field Marshall Erwin Rommel) Duty, Honor, Country: Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying points: to build courage when courage seems to fail; to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith; to create hope when hope becomes forlorn. (General Douglas MacArthur) Rommel and MacArthur are acknowledged as two of the most revered military leaders of the 20 th century. Their words above highlight the importance of duty in being a successful leader. As understood in the military, duty constitutes what you must 'do' -the tasks you perform and the skill with which you perform those tasks (American Heritage Dictionary, 1985). The foundation of leadership in the military rests on one's skills and abilities (McAleer, 2003). Leadership is frequently studied through the lens of the military, perhaps because the stakes of military leadership are measured in terms of life and death. Thus, a movie about the heroic leadership of one of history's most epic military battles presents a fertile ground for exploring skills-based leadership theories.",

In a recent study of a leadership development program, Gilpin-Jackson and Bushe (2006) found that participants were more likely to learn and develop new knowledge, skills, and behaviors if they were able to both observe others using the new knowledge and skills and practice applying the knowledge and skills themselves. This is particularly important for leadership educators whose very work involves developing those skills and abilities in others. The movie 300 can be used to help demonstrate and apply the concepts in the skills approach. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we will focus specifically on the constructs of two wellknown models, Katz's (1955) Three Skill Approach andMumford et al.'s (2000) Skills Model, as vehicles for exploring leadership skills within the movie.",

      "text": "Mumford and his colleagues suggested effective leadership is based on competencies (knowledge and skills), individual attributes (motivation, personality, and cognitive ability), and leadership outcomes (performance). Specifically, \"knowledge is the accumulation of information and the mental structures used to organize that information\" (Northouse, 2007, p. 47), and is the ability to develop mental structures to learn and organize information. Cognitive ability refers to one's intelligence, reasoning skills, and memory skills as well as knowledge acquired throughout life, which influences improved problem-solving and reasoning skills as a result of this acquired knowledge. Motivation refers to one's desire to lead, ability to influence, and commitment to the organization. The Skills Model further suggests that one's career experiences and environments (e.g., access to education, technology, etc.) influence one's development of competencies and individual attributes (Northouse, 2007). These two skills-based approaches to leadership continue to inform leadership theories and models. For that reason, Katz's (1955) and Mumford's et al. (2000) concepts are important seminal approaches to understand the broader spectrum of skills-based approaches to leadership. Although the labels may change slightly and the skills listings may be expanded somewhat, newer approaches to skillsbased leadership still hold vestiges of these early attempts to define leadership through the skills of an individual. For example, Sternberg (2003) proposed a new skills-based approach that included a synthesis of wisdom, intelligence, and creativity. These are roughly equivalent to Katz's (1955) human, technical, and conceptual skills. For another example, Lord and Hall (2005) include skills that equate to the knowledge, skills, cognitive ability, and personality components of Mumford's et al. Three Skills Model, and they add an identity component that somewhat extends the individual attributes component of the Three Skills Model.",

      "text": "When the boy Leonidas leaves home for Agogi, he is placed into violent, harsh, and wild scenarios, including situations in which he is forced to fight to defend himself, to avoid starvation, to survive, to \"return to his people a Spartan, or not at all\" (Snyder et al., 2007, Scene 1). Adopting this vision, young Leonidas successfully defends himself against a wolf which was larger than him. However, it is not the act itself; it is the manner in which it was done. The environment was less than favorable because he was by himself, at night, in extreme cold with little clothing, and only a spear for defense. He had the cognitive ability to devise a plan and, because of his training in Agogi, he developed the technical skills and knowledge (competencies) to execute the plan. Young Leonidas intentionally becomes extremely observant and aware as he analyzes his surroundings, the situation, and the wolf's behaviors. He uses this information to position himself to help ensure accurate execution. This is a demonstration of Katz's (1955) technical and conceptual skills as Leonidas analyzes the situation, draws conclusions, and uses his knowledge and abilities to make decisions and act in order to accomplish his goal -survival. According to Mumford et al.'s (2000) model, Leonidas demonstrates his competencies and individual attributes, specifically knowledge, mental structures, and cognitive abilities. And, as a result, as exclaimed by the narrator, his performance is \"perfect\" (Snyder et al., 2007, Scene 1).",

This is a representation of human skills and individual attributes through influencing others as he not only expresses his values of respect, honor, friendship, and supporting those whom you care about, but he is passing on these values to his son. The lesson is interrupted by a Persian messenger requesting King Leonidas to submit Sparta to Xerxes' Persian Empire. Offended by the messenger's behavior, King Leonidas rejects the request by kicking the messenger and his entourage into a pit where they fall to their death. It is not the act itself; it is the manner in which it was done. Leonidas, now king, once again intentionally becomes extremely aware of his situation and analyzes it before executing his rejection of the Persian entourage. Similar to his encounter with the wolf, he demonstrates his conceptual skills as well as his competencies and individual attributes through knowledge and cognitive abilities. As king, and as a Spartan, he is defending Sparta's values, beliefs, freedom, and reputation. Submitting to Xerxes could mean losing these which is his motivation (individual attributes) to execute his rejection.",
