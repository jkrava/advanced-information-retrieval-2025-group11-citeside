Spartan military ethos and methods did not remain stagnant after Thermopylae. However, strict adherence to the Spartan military culture increasingly eroded the very principles it sought to uphold. By the time Sparta succumbed to Theban military prowess, it had already abandoned the spirit of Thermopylae. From Thermopylae, to Sphacteria, to the Battle of Leuctra, each period experienced a unique shift in the military culture. Thermopylae stood as the high point of Spartan military ethos, Sphacteria the low point, and Leuctra as its last gasp; ultimately, Spartan military ethos destroyed itself because the traditional warrior society was incompatible with necessary innovation.",

      "text": "Xerxes waited four days for the Spartans to withdraw. After this he began the attack. The Persians fell on the Spartans and their allies in waves, but the defenders remained unmoved. 12 As Bradford aptly states, the Spartans \"made it clear to everyone, and, most of all, to the king [Xerxes], that he may have massive numbers, but very few soldiers.\" 13 Even as he was outflanking the Spartans, the Persian commander Hydarnes initially delayed attacking the Phocians guarding the path, fearing that they were Spartans. 14 Their tenacity and skill instilled immense fear into the enemy. Despite being outflanked, Leonidas and his men remained to fight. 15 Knowing that they would die, the Spartans and the Thespians began to fight with heightened ferocity. The Spartans routed the Persian onslaught four times, continuing the battle even after the death of Leonidas. They were so determined and savage in their fighting that the Persians opted to kill the remainder with missiles. As they were shot down the remaining Spartans gathered for a last stand, preparing to fight with daggers, hands, and teeth. 16 After the Battle of Thermopylae, Spartan military ethos gained renown. Epitaphs were even made to glorify those who had died there. While the fame and virtue of those who perished were elevated, those who escaped death at Thermopylae were reviled. Leonidas had ordered two men suffering from an eye disease to depart from the battle. Guided by a helot, one named Eurytos (d. 480 BCE) returned to battle and died with the others. However, the other, Aristodemos (d. 479 BCE), survived and returned home to Sparta. Aristodemos' countrymen were disgusted that he had survived when Eurytos had sacrificed himself. He was labeled as \"Aristodemos the Trembler\" and no Spartan would speak to him or give him fire. 17 Deeming his life was not worth living, he purposely threw himself onto the enemy spears at the Battle of Plataea. 18 Another Spartan named Pantites (d. 480 BCE) survived because he was sent as a messenger to Thessaly. When he returned to Sparta, he faced such great dishonor that he hanged himself. 19 Every Spartan who survived Thermopylae committed suicide out of dishonor. In many ways, Thermopylae and the events surrounding it personify the height of Spartan military ethos.",

When Demosthenes (384-322 BCE) and the Athenian forces landed at Pylos and began to construct fortifications, the Spartans were largely unconcerned. 20 Once again, the Spartans were delayed because they were celebrating a festival. Even if the Athenians intended to stay, the Spartans were confident that they could defeat them. 21 By the time Agis (d. 399 BCE) scrambled back to defend Attica, the Athenians had already fortified themselves. 22 The Spartans launched an attack by land and sea, but they were unable to take Pylos from Demosthenes' men. Their naval inferiority turned out to be their downfall at Pylos. Demosthenes knew this and was able to defend isolated areas effectively. If the Spartans had been able to make a strong landing, they would have certainly killed the Athenians. 23 However, the Spartans were limited both by the terrain and their navy.

This dilemma was primarily caused by a population shortage resulting from eugenics practices and the low birth rates connected to a barracks lifestyle. Both factors prevented the Spartans from reproducing at a sustainable rate for effective long-term warfare. Therefore, it was vital for Sparta to recover these men, even at the cost of its national honor. Even so there is a distinct difference between the morale during the time of Thermopylae and at Sphacteria. At Thermopylae the Spartans were willing to lose their beloved king in battle and sallied out even during the festival of the Karneia. On the other hand, the Spartans at Sphacteria were unwilling to sacrifice themselves for a lost cause. Their martial honor was not paramount. Similarly, the survivors of Thermopylae and Sphacteria faced very different fates. While the two survivors of Thermopylae were shamed into suicide, the survivors of Sphacteria received lighter treatment. Once the hostages were returned, their full civil rights were taken away from them. However, the Spartans did this out of fear that they would revolt, not entirely because their deeds were considered shameful. Later their rights were restored. 35 The Spartan military ethos did not adapt aspects of their culture requisite for maintaining a sizable force of soldiers.

Later in his reign Agesilaus even offered his services as a mercenary to Egyptian rebels. 37 This was considered a great disgrace. Compared to previous kings, Agesilaus was quite averse to Spartan tradition. However, this was not the only deviation from tradition under his reign. Agesilaus incorporated mercenaries and cavalry into the Spartan military. 38 Sparta's past refusal to adopt these kinds of soldiers had hurt them, particularly at Sphacteria. Nevertheless, they were completely counter to the old Spartan military ethos. After the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans had to remodel their military system, mainly due to a decline in Spartan citizens. These Spartan citizens had served as the backbone of the military in the past, but now the Spartans had to bring in foreign soldiers. 39 This decline of Spartan citizens was directly parallel to the general population decline of Sparta.

During the Boeotian War, king Cleombrotus of Sparta (d. 371 BCE) led his men against the Theban forces. 41 Determined to avoid accusations of cowardice, he drove his men to join in battle. 42 As the two sides prepared to fight, mercenaries under Hiero attacked members of the Theban baggage train. 43 In doing so, these troops pushed the Thebans back into their own ranks and condensed their formation. 44 The Spartans kept their horses in front of their squares of infantry. During this time their cavalry was inferior to the Thebans'. Spartans did not invest much effort into their cavalry, and they tended to be the most inexperienced men in the army. Additionally, the Spartan heavily infantry was lined up with a depth of no more than twelve men, while the Thebans formed a close formation of fifty on their own left flank. 45 With this formation, the Thebans would overwhelm Cleombrotus' right flank, and then the rest of the army. 46 The Thebans caught the Spartans by surprise. Before Cleombrotus was able to properly position his troops, the lackluster Spartan cavalry had already been thrashed by the Thebans. The fleeing Spartan cavalry ran through their own ranks, causing discord. This occurred just as the",

When the messengers returned to Sparta with news of the battle, the people were celebrating the Gymnopaediae. Rather than interrupt the last day of the festival, the ephors decided to not make a public calamity. They secretly informed the bereaved families, warning the women to not make their sorrow heard. However, the next day, all those who had lost family at Leuctra were radiant while those whose family had survived mourned as though their kin had died instead. 50 In this way the strict Spartan mindset remained intact. The glory of the slain and the shame of the survivors was one aspect of Spartan military ethos that remained during this time. The ephors' behavior during the festival was also significant. Despite the calamity at Leuctra, the ephors still insisted that the proper rites should be observed. Nevertheless, present necessity still prevailed over the old Spartan way. Although their families mourned their survival, the soldiers were still granted clemency.

Many Spartans had fled during Leuctra, and the ephors wanted to find some way around the laws that mandated a loss of status for cowardice. Therefore, they chose Agesilaus to act as lawgiver. Giving a public statement, Agesilaus said, \"I would not become a lawgiver to make the laws different from the present ones, nor would I add, subtract, or alter anything. On the contrary, it is fine for these current laws of ours to be valid -from tomorrow.\" 51 This demonstrates the deterioration of Spartan military discipline since Sphacteria. At least the soldiers at Sphacteria received some kind of temporary punishment. After Leuctra the Spartans simply ignored their laws for pragmatic reasons. This stands in stark contrast to the military ethos displayed during Thermopylae. Leuctra and its aftermath vividly demonstrate how the Spartan military ethos destroyed itself. Sparta's eugenics, barracks culture, and failure to effectively diversify its military all eroded its military ethos. Innovation and compromise came too late to save a dying system.",
