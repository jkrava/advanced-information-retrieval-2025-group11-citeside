      "text": "The courageous sacrifice of Leonidas and the Spartans is perhaps the central theme of Herodotus' narrative and of many popular retellings of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BCE. Even as modern historians are appropriately more critical of this heroizing impulse, they have tended to focus their attention on issues that might explain why Leonidas and his men fought to the death. These include discussion of the broader strategic and tactical importance of Thermopylae, the inter-relationship and chronology of the Greek defense of the pass and the naval campaign at Artemisium, the actual number of Greeks who served under Leonidas and whether it was sufficient to hold the position, and so on. While this article inevitably touches upon some of these same topics, its main purpose is to reconsider the decisive yet often overlooked moment of the battle: the failure of the 1,000 Phocians on the Anopaea path.",

      "text": "I make three arguments regarding the Phocian defense of the path at Thermopylae, aspects of which have been raised before but have not been widely accepted by scholars. First, that the discovery of the Anopaea was not dependent upon the treachery of Ephialtes, but that the Persians were aware of it from the moment of their arrival and planned their attacks at Thermopylae, Artemisium, and against the Phocians accordingly. Second, that Herodotus' claims that the failure of the Phocians was due to surprise, confusion, and incompetence are not convincing. And third, that the best explanation for the Phocian behavior is that they were from Delphi and betrayed their allies in a bid to restore local control over the oracle of Apollo. One consequence of these arguments is to recast the reasons for the Persian success at Thermopylae. Rather than being a fortunate victory owing to the treachery of a single individual, Xerxes and his generals drove the heavily armed Greeks from a highly defensible position following the disciplined execution of a sensible tactical plan that took advantage of local terrain and exploited vulnerabilities in the nascent anti-Persian alliance.",

      "text": "The Persians had long experience waging wars in the mountainous regions of their homeland and throughout the Achaemenid Empire. The idea that a flanking maneuver did not occur to Xerxes and his generals prior to Ephialtes' appearance is implausible. Similarly problematic is the notion that the King would have ordered a night march along the Anopaea immediately after learning of its existence, putting his elite Immortals at risk of an ambush without first scouting the path or its defenders. The Persian army had scouts, as Herodotus himself reports (7.208), and Burn is correct to observe that, \"it may be safely assumed that reconnaissance began on the day of the arrival of the first Persian cavalry\". 4 Persian ground forces arrived four days before hostilities commenced and six days before the decisive march on the Anopaea (7.210.1). 5 They therefore had nearly a full week to survey the local terrain and to observe the Greek defenders on the path and at the Gates themselves. In addition to his own Persians, Xerxes had allied Greek scouts and informants at his service. Most notable among these were the Thessalians, who had campaigned against the Phocians and even used the path within living memory 1 All citations of ancient sources are to Herodotus unless otherwise noted. 2 Macan (1908), 315-319, and (vol. 2), 233 persuasively argues that Ephialtes was a scapegoat in the later rehabilitation of Delphi against charges of medism; How and Wells (1912), 225;Burn (1962), 407-413;Hignett (1963), 145;Georges (1986), 53; Dandamaev (1989), 200;Szemler, Cherf, and Kraft (1996), 73-74. For the literary and thematic role played by Ephialtes in Herodotus' account, see Immerwahr (1966), 261-263. 3 Grundy (1901), 299-300;Olmstead (1948), 252; Pritchett (1958); Lazenby (1964), 271 and(1993), 140-141;Munro (1964), 293-300;Hammond (1988), 555-556;Balcer (1995), 252; Green (1996), 137-138;Cartledge (2007), 146; Stoneman (2015), 135. 4 Burn (1962), 407. Simpson (1972), 4-5 cites Xerxes' experience in mountain warfare as the reason the Persians outmaneuvered the Phocians. See also Dandamaev (1989), 200. Briant (2002), 374-376 surveys the various Gates found in the Achaemenid Empire, and concludes by pointing out that they were hardly invulnerable: \"in every case, they could be circumvented via footpaths pointed out by local peasants and herdsmen -exactly the way that Thermopylae fell into the hands of the Persians in 480.\" See also Hignett (1963), 133. Herodotus notes that the Greeks themselves recognized the danger of being turned by the placement of the Phocians on the Anopaea and by their withdrawal from Tempe earlier (7.173.4). 5 Scholars have failed to reach a consensus on the calendar dates for the Persian journey from Therma to Thermopylae and Artemisium, as Herodotus' diary of the Persian invasion is often unclear or inconsistent. Sacks (1976) makes the case for mid-September, and is followed by Hammond (1988), 570, but most appear to favor the month of August, See How and Wells (1912), 372-375;Maurice (1930), 212-213;Burn (1962), 403-405;Dascalakis (1962), 89-110, 185-187;Hignett (1963), 448-453;Hammond (1982), 75-82 and (1988), Table 4; Lazenby (1993), 118-119;Stoneman (2015), 226-228. My argument here is not especially dependent upon either proposed date.",

Once either fell, there was little reason for Greek forces to remain at the other. 9 Herodotus' comment that fighting on land and sea occurred over the same three days thus makes sense from a tactical perspective (8.15.1), and privileging it over a few other potentially (but not necessarily) contradictory statements results in the following relative chronology of the engagement. 10",

For recent treatments of the Greek strategy that emphasize the coordination between land and sea forces, see Matthew (2009) and ( 2013). 10 The controversy is due to several statements that contradict this comment, namely that the army allowed four days to pass before attacking upon its arrival (7.210); that the fleet arrived at Aphetae three days after the army did at Thermopylae (7.196); and that the Persian fleet remained at Cape Sepias for three days because of the storm, which abated on the fourth day (7.192.1). I have chosen to privilege the statement that the fighting took place over the same three days, and reconciled these discrepancies -which may be explained in part simply by the fact that every contingent in the Persian army may not have reached the pass on the same day -by counting the day of the Persian army's arrival as the first day of its wait, but not as one of the three days prior to the fleet's arrival. On this arrangement, see Immerwahr (1966), 257-258 n. 62. Most scholars have adopted a relative timeline close to, if not exactly the same as, the one proposed here. See Bury (1895Bury ( -1896), 95-97;), 95-97;Grundy (1901), 319-341;Macan (1908 vol. 2), 275-286;Burn (1962), 395-400;Dascalakis (1962), 149-170, 185-187;Hignett (1963), 379-385;Evans (1969), 401 n. 86;Lazenby (1993), 119;Green (1996), 124-144. Stoneman (2015), 227-228 recently posited that the battles on land and sea took place on entirely separate days, but this is in direct contradiction to Herodotus' statement and to the tactical reliance of the defensive positions on one another.",

The ground assault coincided with two actions at sea: while one part of the fleet -200 ships, according to Herodotus -ventured into open waters to attempt the doomed passage around Euboea, the other engaged the Greek fleet off Artemisium. Of these three movements, the circumnavigation of Euboea had the greatest potential. Had it been completed successfully, Persian marines and ships would have surrounded and probably annihilated the Greek defenders on both land and sea. The circumnavigation began in the afternoon of Day 5. The island of Euboea is roughly 180 kilometers in length, and a trireme at maximum efficiency and under favorable weather conditions could sail about 240 kilometers in a day. 11 Given the weather conditions, the initial path that took them around Sciathus in order to conceal their movements from the Greeks, and the likelihood that the narrows between Euboea and 11 Figures for the speed of a trireme are from van Wees (2004), 206, but see also Casson (1991), 84-85. Rahe (2015), 230 asserts that the circumnavigation of Euboea would take three days, but does not explain his reasoning. Macan (1908), 367-368 calculates a travel time of 36 hours. Hammond (1988), 553 suggests that it could have been performed in as few as 25 hours. In any case, Xerxes could hardly have counted on the fleet making the best possible time. For the difficulties that might slow a fleet attempting the maneuver, see How and Wells (1912), 210-211. Even conceding that the Persians could have accomplished the feat in 25 hours, they would have arrived in the late afternoon / early evening on Day 6. This would have allowed them to hold the Euripus strait while resting overnight, and then join the coordinated attack the following morning against the Greek positions on land and sea. For one possible route of the fleet, see Bowen (1998), 362-363.",

Thus the fighting on Day 5 and Day 6 was probably more intended to probe Greek defenses and maintain close contact than to overwhelm them via sustained frontal attacks on their position at the Gates. 14 In the event that Leonidas attempted to withdraw in order to escape the trap being set by the circumnavigation, the King's forces would be closely positioned to seize the Phocian Wall and to inflict casualties on the retreating Greeks. 15 The small Greek army could not hope to defeat the Persian ground forces in a single, decisive engagement, and so would have to rely on a defensive war of attrition for victory on land. The only way for the Greeks to gain an immediate and decisive victory over the Persians at this point would have been to destroy the enemy ships that remained at Aphetae, 16 and so it is not surprising that the Persians also adopted a cautious approach on sea. They did not entirely avoid engaging the Greeks, but, as Herodotus reports, Greek ships were the aggressors in the fighting that did take place. They appear to have 12 As Georges (1986), 49-50 observes, Xerxes likely based his plans for the circumnavigation of Euboea on intelligence from his Greek advisors and from Persians (e. g., Artaphernes) who had participated in the 490 campaign to Eretria and Marathon. 13 The arrival of 53 triremes to reinforce the Greeks at Artemisium on Day 6 may have signaled to Xerxes that the Greeks were not afraid of being trapped in the straits and therefore that the circumnavigation had failed. Herodotus does not make this connection, but it is possible that the Greeks had positioned these ships toward the southern end of Euboea, and recalled them to Artemisum on Day 6 after receiving reports of the destruction of the Persian detachment off the island's eastern coast the night before (8.14). Bury (1895Bury ( -1896)), 88-89 suggests that these 53 ships were posted at the Euripus strait until the failure of the Persian circumnavigation. See also Munro (1902), 308-311;Myres (1953), 257-258;Evans (1969), 399;Georges (1986), 49-50;Rahe (2015), 234. Cf. Macan (1908), 377;Lazenby (1964), 273-274. Hammond (1988), 555 simply observes that news of the destruction of the Persian circumnavigators arrived at the same time as the Greek reinforcements. 14 How and Wells (1912), 376, \"The Persian leaders, whose attacks on the first two days may perhaps have been feints intended to distract attention from their real designs, evidently aimed at turning the position, first by sending their fleet round Euboea, and then by the path Anopaea.\" See also Macan (1908), 378. 15 It is for this very reason -to cover the retreat of the allies -that many have suggested Leonidas remained in the pass even after learning that the Phocians had failed. See, for example, Dascalakis (1962), 75-78;Burn (1962), 417-418;Evans (1969), 395;Simpson (1972), 6-7. 16 Matthew (2009), 17 notes that Greek ground forces were not able to inflict a decisive defeat on the Persians, but that the fleet could, even if doing so was not necessarily the Greek plan. See similar comments by How and Wells (1912), 375-376;Last (1943), 65;Ferrill (1966), 109. Against the idea that the Greek planned to strike decisively with their fleet, see Evans (1969). My main point here is not necessarily that the Greeks themselves sought a decisive engagement on the sea, but that, if they did hope to defeat Persian forces in a single engagement (rather than wage a prolonged defensive war of attrition), then their only hope was on the sea rather than on land. In turn, from a Persian perspective it made sense to avoid risking a full engagement with the Greek fleet before the day of the decisive battle on land. Balcer (1989) argues that an inability to adequately supply Persian forces led Xerxes and his generals to launch several attacks too soon and was a main factor in the invasion's failure.",

Plutarch (On the Malice of Herodotus 32) and Diodorus of 9.3) ignore the episode entirely, and most modern historians either omit it or follow the basic narrative offered by Herodotus (7.218): the sudden appearance of the Persians surprised them and, believing that they themselves were the objects of the attack, the Phocians retreated to higher ground after a single volley of arrows. Ignoring them, the Persians continued their descent behind the rear of the Greek defenders below. 18Yet there are obvious problems with Herodotus' apologetic account of the Persian advance on the Anopaea. 19 He writes that the Phocians had set no pickets or guards at all along the path or before their camp, and were asleep until they heard the noise of the Persian approach. Contrary to the assertions of some modern historians, there is evidence from ancient sources that setting guards around military camps was standard practice already by the time of the Persian invasion. 20 Notably, Herodotus offers no criticism of this grave error, which ultimately led to the slaughter of their Greek allies and to the loss of the pass below.",

Even so, they abandoned their position after one barrage of arrows. Again, Herodotus does not offer any negative comment on their retreat, portraying their actions as confused but nonetheless heroic. Once on higher ground, he states that they prepared to die manfully, thinking themselves the object of the attack. But the defense of the path was critical to the entire Greek war strategy, and the Persians were obviously marching along it to bypass Leonidas' position, not to kill the Phocians themselves. That they made no effort to block or even delay the Persian advance due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of their task is, quite simply, not believable. 21 Even granting that the Phocians may have been surprised and withdrew in a momentary panic, their failure to regroup and launch a counter-attack remains problematic. The Persians would have been vulnerable to a charge against their flank from higher ground as they passed the Phocian position. They also would have been vulnerable to an attack from behind -again, from higher ground -after they had passed the Phocian position and were on their descent to the Gates. In this way, the Phocians could have turned the tables on the Persians, surrounding them even as they attempted to do the same to Leonidas and his allies at the Thermopylae pass itself. 22 Perhaps the Persians recognized the threat the Phocians would have continued to pose from their position and left some number of soldiers behind to protect their own rear, but Herodotus is silent on the matter. 23 If they were trapped on the mountainside, did they surrender? And if they were not, why, again, did they not try to help Leonidas before it was too late? Even as Herodotus details how the rest of the Greeks escaped, surrendered, or were killed by the Persians, we receive no comment on what became of the Phocians. The very fact that he has sources enough to narrate their experience in even a limited manner suggests that some, if not all, survived.foot_5 Indeed, their absence from the casualty lists and memorial traditions of the final stand at Thermopylae indicates that they did not fight to the death, and probably did not resist at all. 25Herodotus' apology on behalf of the Phocians is not convincing. The reality is that they were given a critical assignment, and had at the least several days to select and prepare to defend their position. 26 As Last observed, \"it is scarcely credible that they can have been assigned a task which, if events called for its performance, their numbers were completely inadequate to discharge\". 27 Yet it is quite clear that they did not even delay the Persians. Herodotus makes no mention of the Phocians resisting after the first discharge of arrows against them, and his chronology of the march leaves little time for further action. 28Comparative evidence casts their failure in starker relief. In the Battle of Thermopylae of 279 BCE, the Greeks once again assigned the defense of the Anopaea to their Phocian contingent, this time 3,000-strong. 29 Facing the Romans roughly eighty years later, Antiochus III tasked allied Aetolians to defend the Anopaea path with 1,000 soldiers -the same number as the Phocians before them. 30 As in 480, the defenders of the path in 279 and 191 were attacked at times of low visibility either at night or under heavy fog, but were still able to hold their position and offer battle for some time. While in both instances they were ultimately defeated, their experience is evidence that 1,000 Phocians should have been sufficient to offer some resistance to the Persians and at least delay their advance. 31Rather than suggest that they were given an impossible task, most scholars have explained the Phocian failure as a result of simple cowardice or incompetence. 32 However, every other anecdote Herodotus mentions reveals the Phocians implementing the very tactics -seizing the high ground, forcing battle in narrow terrain, and setting ambushes -we would expect from a people with experience resisting larger armies in the mountains. During a previous war against the Thessalians, for instance, they surprised an invading army as it climbed the slopes of Mt. Parnassus at night, covering their bodies and armor with white chalk both to distinguish themselves from and terrify their foes (8.27). In another encounter, they crushed the Thessalians by luring their cavalry into a narrow pass where they had buried empty pots. When the enemy horse charged, their hooves fell into the pots, which tripped them and broke their legs (8.26). 33Herodotus does not indicate that the Phocians lost their resourcefulness or courage in the decades following their war against Thessaly. To the contrary, the Phocians who remained loyal to the Greek cause after Thermopylae harassed Persian supply lines from their refuge on Mt. Parnassus (9.31.5). Those who collaborated with the Persians are reported to have demonstrated bravery and discipline in the face of a threatening Persian cavalry maneuver upon their arrival at Plataea (9.17-18). As some of the most experienced and capable Greeks at fighting in the mountains, they should have had been aware of the need to set a watch through the night and understood that their defeat was not the ultimate aim of the Persian attack force. Perhaps these otherwise stalwart warriors merely suffered a momentary lapse one night on the Anopaea path, but it is worth considering an alternative explanation: that they betrayed their Greek allies at the Gates below.",

      "text": "Scholars questioned the loyalty of the Phocian contingent at Thermopylae already in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The strongest advocate of this view was Munro, who cast doubts on what he called Herodotus' \"lame apology\" for the Phocians in a 1902 article. Munro suggested that the Phocian defensive position was at a fork on the Anopaea path, where one route entered Phocis itself and the other circled back behind the Greeks at Thermopylae. Faced with the difficult choice of defending their homeland or their allies upon the sudden arrival of the Immortals, they selfishly but understandably made the decision to abandon Leonidas and guard the road into Phocis. 34Munro's hypothesis is tactically and topographically problematic, however, and suggestions that they betrayed their allies have unsurprisingly fallen out of favor. 35 It is difficult to believe that the Phocians would have selected a position that forced them to choose between guarding a passage into their homeland and defending their allies. 36Moreover, while the probable Phocian position near Nevropolis may have been in front of a possible footpath into Phocis, it was not a major road in antiquity and was not a route taken by the Persian army following the victory at Thermopylae. 37Nonetheless, there remain good reasons to suspect that they betrayed their allies. Most significant is Herodotus' silence on their fate after the battle. Given his eagerness to narrate heroic acts of resistance in general, this silence is a strong sign that their actual actions were quite shameful in the eyes of later Greeks. Either the Phocians somehow escaped home, abandoning the high ground to which they had fled and on which Herodotus claims they were prepared to fight to the death, or they surrendered without a fight and joined the Persian cause. The latter possibility seems most likely to me, and it would explain why Herodotus reports that the Phocian contingent that fought for the Persians at Plataea in 479 was exactly the same size as the force stationed on the Anopaea the year before.foot_19",

In the process of explaining why they rejected this extortion, he relates several anecdotes about the resourceful Phocian resistance against Thessaly a few decades earlier (discussed above).

On Herodotus' depictions of the decision to medize by various Greeks states (though not Phocis), see Baragwanath (2008), 203-239. 40 Herodotus lists them in the following order: Drymaia, Charadra, Erochos, Tithronion, Amphikleia, Neon, Pedieis, Triteia, Elateia, Hyampolis, Parapotamioi, Abai, Panopeos, Daulis, and Aiolidai.",

One major engagement of this conflict was fought at Hyampolis, at the southern end of the Valley; another was near Tithora, a peak overlooking Neon on the eastern slope of Parnassus (8.27-28). This was, in fact, the exact same place where the Phocian resistance was based during the invasion of Xerxes. 41 After defeating the Greek coalition at Thermopylae, then, the Persians specifically targeted the Phocian federal state -both its primary population centers along the Cephisus and its federal building near Daulis -for destruction. 42 According to Herodotus, the Persians ravaged Phocis at the behest of the Thessalians. In relaying this information, Herodotus gives the impression that the Phocians joined the anti-Persian alliance out of self-preservation rather than a broader commitment to an independent Greece or a sense of camaraderie with their allies (8.30). This, in turn, could be viewed as the reason why they retreated from the Anopaea rather than risk their lives to protect the Greek forces at the Gates. In light of the widespread destruction of their homeland after the fall of the pass, however, any such decision to abandon their allies below would have been extremely shortsighted and disastrously counterproductive. 43 Making matters worse, their enemies in Thessaly appear to have viewed the Persian invasion as an opportunity to do more than merely to punish the Phocians. Following Thermopylae, the Thessalians asserted that it was within their power to dispossess the Phocians of their territory and even to enslave them, and so demanded heavy payments -i. e., tribute -in return for protection from the Persians (8.29). Whether the Phocian federation joined Leonidas and the rest of the Greeks for selfish reasons or out of some higher-minded idealism, they had the most to lose at Thermopylae out of any of the allies, and should have been as committed to the success of the mission and the broader anti-Persian campaign as any other group present. Persian success at the Gates meant the temporary loss of their homes, and Persian success in the war itself would have meant the restoration of Thessalian hegemony over Phocis, which had ended only three decades earlier.",

No longer able to block the Persian advance into their homeland, these Phocians withdrew to the stronghold on Mt.

In his survey of the muster at Thermopylae, he notes that the Locrians sent their entire hoplite levy, while the Phocians sent 1,000 soldiers. This wording leaves open the possibility that Phocis could raise more than the soldiers sent to Thermopylae, and this is confirmed by the fact that later in the war some Phocians resisted the Persians from Parnassus while 1,000 others fought alongside them at Plataea. It is not unreasonable to infer that the remainder of the Phocian military force was stationed at the only other route into the Cephisus Valley, whence they had been levied. 46",

This region does not appear to have suffered at all at the hands of the Persians and, in contrast to Abae and numerous other Greek sanctuaries, Delphi was not sacked or plundered. The reason for this is not because the Persians simply did not pass through the area. Herodotus reports that a division of troops was sent to Delphi, but defeated through miraculous, divine intervention: first, a rock-fall killed many Persian soldiers, and then the survivors were chased away by two local, larger-than-life heroes dressed as hoplites. Tellingly, he does not suggest that the 44 In an unnecessary contradiction to Herodotus due to their strident belief that a road into central Greece could not have passed through Thermopylae itself, Kase and Szemler (1982), 364 place the 1,000 Phocians at Pergara above the Dhema Gap rather than at Nevropolis on the Anopaea. Pritchett (1985Pritchett ( ), 190-216, (1989Pritchett ( ), 118-122, and (1991)), 194-205 quite persuasively criticized their entire reconstruction of events, which stray far from the ancient source material. See also Cawkwell (2005), 274-276. The occupation of this route by the remainder of the Phocians, suggested recently by Cawkwell (2005), 276 and Rahe (2015), 213, 224, would answer the question raised by Londey (2013), 149, echoing Hignett (1963), 134: \"why Xerxes did not simply ignore the defenders [at Thermopylae] and go the other way\" into Phocis via Doris. I would further suggest instead that these Phocians -that is, those not dispatched to join Leonidas, but the ones who defended the Dhema Gap road -were stationed at the village of Oiti or at Kastro Orias, a strategically fortified site discussed by Mackay (1963), 67;Pritchett (1982), 216-226;and Kraft et al. (1987), 195;Green (1996), 115. For a map with these locations identified, see Kase andSzemler (1982), 354. Rapp (2013) offers a recent survey of the scholarship on the local topography at Thermopylae in 480. 45 Macan (1908 vol. 2), 269-272 suggests another plausible and not mutually-exclusive factor: that any operations that took place on this route were omitted by Herodotus due to the historian's reliance on Spartan sources, who were mainly concerned with the legacy of Leonidas. 46 Beloch (1931), 99 already suggested that the Phocians could have mustered additional forces. Cawkwell (2005), 276, adds, \"it is highly likely that in 480 the Phocians could field a good many more than the thousand Herodotus talks about. Where were they then? It seems all too probable they were ready to help defend Doris and that the Dorians 'were taking the side of the Mede' (8.31) only after the Greek failure at Thermopylae.\"",

Rock falls in this region are common, and Herodotus' comment that he himself, decades later, saw some rocks on the roadside -the very ones, he claims, that fell upon the Persians -is hardly convincing evidence to support the story. 47 In reality, the Persian mission was probably welcomed at Delphi rather than killed en route. The stories of miraculous protection are nothing more than an attempt to explain why the sanctuary had not been sacked along with the other settlements of Phocis after Persia's defeat, when the oracle's collaboration had become an embarrassment. Herodotus cites priests from the sanctuary as his sources, and scholars have long recognized that they provided him with material designed to sanitize the sanctuary's behavior before and during the war. 48 Although he does record oracles to Athens and Sparta suggesting that victory was possible, in the estimation of many, these were post-war revisions to the sanctuary's initial responses that had encouraged many Greek states to surrender or at least remain neutral. 49 The priests even allowed Gelon of Syracuse to send money to Delphi to give to Xerxes in the event that the Persians were successful (7.163). 50 In the face of this evidence, several scholars have attempted to prove that the sanctuary at Delphi did not medize. One argument is that most of the oracles relating to the Persian invasion were revised or entirely fabricated in the decades that followed, and so cannot be taken as evidence of the sanctuary's stance during the invasion. 51 Even granting this hypothesis, however, the contents of many of these revisionist oracles advocate against resistance to the Persians, meaning that later Greeks accepted the possibility that the priests had medized and premised their own self-serving oracles upon it.",

In this span of nine days from the Persian victory at the Gates to the arrival of the Persian fleet at Phalerum, the Athenian representatives -whom he speculates must have already been at Delphi -are claimed to have learned of the defeats and returned with an oracular response to Athens, where the Athenian assembly decided to confront the Persians at Salamis and carried out the evacuation of the city. 53 Georges (1986), 26 n. 28 dismisses the oracle's initial reported response to abandon hope against Persia without any clear rationale (7.140-141). His argument is also self-refuting, since he later (p. 37) claims that it was easy for states to misrepresent the contents of oracular responses \"with no one the wiser.\" By this logic, whatever reports the Athenian delegates delivered to the assembly should not be taken as Delphi's response or policy, but as the opinion of the delegates themselves. 54 Scott (2014), 114. 55 Georges (1986), 28 n. 30. Crahay (1956), 341 makes the same argument. 56 As Macan (1908), 398 observes, \"If Delphi escaped their [the rest of the Phocians'] fate, its escape may have been due to the very different attitude of the Thessalians (and other medizing states) to Phocis and to the Amphictyonic shrine.\" See also Burn (1962), 425-426;Lazenby (1993), 151-152. 57 Scott (2014), 116, expanding on comments made by Crahay (1956), 342. 58 For medism in north and central Greece, see Gillis (1979), 60;Graf (1979), 155-181. 59 Similarly, Cyrus II refused to allow the Ionian Greeks to remain neutral during his war against Croesus, and following his victory punished those who had earlier refused to submit to him (1.76, 141). 60 See Nielsen (2007) and Waters (2014) for Argos; Freitag (1996) for Achaea. Delphi also advised the Cretans against intervening on behalf of the anti-Persian alliance (7.169).",

      "text": "ity to Sparta in the Peloponnese, can it really be doubted that the Argives in particular would have joined the Persians had they broken through the isthmus at Corinth? 61 Those who reject the medism of Delphi also deny that the Persians ever attempted to visit the sanctuary. It has been argued that the trip was not worth the trouble, since the oracle \"lay at the terminus of a difficult route,\" and, if any of Xerxes' soldiers did make the journey, they would have been \"merely undisciplined looters\". 62 Plainly, this is not a convincing reason to reject Herodotus' report of the expedition. Delphi was the wealthiest, most influential sanctuary in the Greek world, and it defies reason that the King would have ignored it merely because the road was too difficult. 63 An alternative proposal is that that Herodotus' priestly sources invented the Persian expedition to Delphi in order to \"give the city and sanctuary at least some honor and crucial role\" in the war. 64 But surely it is more reasonable to think that the story recorded by Herodotus is the result of an attempt by the priests to offer an apologetic interpretation of what in hindsight was an embarrassing visit by the Persians, rather than to believe that they invented the visit itself whole cloth. Indeed, if the priests had taken the liberty to completely fabricate a self-serving account of their actions during the war, they were remarkably inept. Rather than demonstrate proof of the oracle's honor, their quite obviously incredible anecdote has instead convinced many of its medism! 65 Another suggestion is that the Persians avoided Delphi because their general Mardonius had received an oracle stating that the invasion would fail if any harm came to it (9.42). 66 Once again, however, this interpretation actually relies on evidence that favors collaboration: in effect, it suggests that the Persians did consult the Pythia, and received a response indicating that the conquest of Greece would be successful so long as Delphi itself was spared. Moreover, this argument does not acknowledge that Herodotus immediately dismisses the veracity of this particular oracle -thus eliminating it as a reason for dismissing the existence of the expedition to the sanctuary -by claiming that it was delivered to Illyrians rather than the Persians (9.43). The priests of Delphi in Herodotus' time would have of course been keen to discredit any report that their forebears had given the shrine's blessing to the Persian invasion, and so it is telling that they 61 Much as Argos' non-participation at the Battle of Chaereonea in 338 was a sign of its support for Philip II. After his victory, Philip rewarded the Argives with territory taken from Sparta, and in turn the Argives helped install a pro-Macedonian faction in power at Elis. See Rop (2017), 311;Tomlinson (1972), 144-146;Roebuck (1948), 76. As Munro (1902), 302-303 noted long ago, the possibility that Argos would openly medize and attack was likely a major factor in Sparta's unwillingness to empty the Peloponnese of soldiers and send a large army north to Thermopylae. 62 Georges (1986), 28 n. 30. 63 Kaplan (2006), 130-139 notes that the Persians, like their Phrygian, Lydian, and Egyptian predecessors, were well aware of the oracle's significance. 64 Crahay (1956), 335;Scott (2014), 116-118. 65 As Graf (1979), 187-188 observes, \"it seems almost certain that the legendary tale was created to conceal some embarrassment suffered by the priests at Delphi.\" 66 Scott (2014), 116. This explanation is also promoted by Kindt (2016), 49. On the plausibility of Mardonius consulting the oracle, see Graf (1979), 188-190. Crahay (1956), 97 notes that the priests must have had a stock oracular response that warned invaders against sacking the sanctuary (see also p. 291-293 for his discussion of this particular tradition).",

      "text": "challenged only the prophecy's audience, not its existence. The mere fact that Herodotus undertakes the effort to repudiate this oracle is a sign that reports of the sanctuary's collaboration with Persia continued to circulate in the late fifth century. Finally, it has been claimed that Delphi's potential medism is not consistent with the numerous, expensive dedications made at the sanctuary by the victorious Greeks after the wars. 67 Yet few medizers were actually punished by the anti-Persian alliance, 68 and the ambiguities in many of the surviving oracular responses indicate that Delphi hedged its support for the invaders sufficiently to avoid being completely discredited. More importantly, the withdrawal of Persian forces from Greece likely meant that the Phocians of the Cephisus Valley regained control of the sanctuary. 69 Because the oracle was no longer in the hands of Persian collaborators, there is no need to see any contradiction in the post-war dedications to Apollo and the wartime behavior of the Delphians. 70 To those familiar with the political history of the sanctuary, the split between the Delphians and the Phocians of the Cephisus Valley should come as no surprise. Whereas north and east Phocis had chafed under Thessalian rule in the sixth century, Delphi prospered. Thessaly's intervention in the First Sacred War ca. 590 had expanded the sanctuary's territory at the expense of nearby rival Crissa, which was annihilated. It had also established the sanctuary's autonomy from the rest of Phocis: rather than being dominated by its neighbors, Delphi enjoyed self-governance under the protection and guidance of the Amphictyonic Council, which was controlled by Thessaly. 71 Ancient sources make no explicit comment on the status of Delphi vis-Ã -vis the rest of Phocis in the wake of the expulsion of the Thessalians, but it is reasonable to think that the Phocians took control of the sanctuary as part of their broader program of political unification, which included minting coins in the name of all Phocis and establishing the Phokikon near Daulis. Located on the Sacred Way between the sanctuary and the southern terminus of the Cephisus Valley, Daulis was also the easternmost site razed by the Persians in the region. Delphi's escape from destruction was not mere coincidence or the happy consequence of a miraculously timed and aimed rock fall, but a sign thatmuch as they had done in the First and would do in the Second and Third Sacred Wars -67 Bowden (2005), 27-28;Scott (2014), 117. 68 Gillis (1979), 80-81. 69 McInerny (1999), 188 notes that the next mention of Phocis in ancient literary sources occurs in relation to events in the year 458, when the Phocians are presented as a unified polity in control of Delphi (Plutarch Kimon 17.3). 70 A similar argument is made by Graf (1979), 190-192. Nielsen (2007) suggests that the medism of Argos may also be one reason (among others) for the lack of dedications by the Hellenic League at Nemea after the wars, but crucially there was no change in control over this sanctuary as there probably was at Delphi. 71 For background on this conflict and Delphi's historical relationship to Thessaly and the rest of Phocis, see Macan (1908), 408;Forrest (1956) and(1957); Lehmann (1980) and(1983); Brodersen (1991), 3-9;Davies (1994); LefÃ¨vre (1995), 24-25;McInerney (1997) and(1999), 162-174;Howe (2003). Robertson (1978) denies the historicity of the First Sacred War; while his analysis has not been widely accepted, he does not reject the two elements about the episode most important for my argument here: 1) Thessalian control over Phocis for much of the sixth century, and 2) that there was a long-running animosity between Delphi and the rest of Phocis. On pro-Persian sentiments in Thessaly, see Graf (1979), 159-168.",

This scenario also explains the otherwise puzzling Persian response to the arrival of the Phocians at the start of the campaign season the following year: since some Phocians were actively resisting, Mardonius ordered his cavalry to surround these Phocians to ensure that they were indeed his allies, whom he would and did recognize on sight from their surrender on the Anopaea, before allowing them to enter the Persian camp near Plataea.",
