      "text": "The eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD caused extensive destructions all over the Campanian area, engulfing the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplonti and Stabiae. The eruption followed a long quiescence period and the inhabitants of the area were surprised by the volcanic events. The first part of the eruption was characterized by a widespread dispersal of pumices from a high eruptive column. The second part of the eruption, characterized by pyroclastic flows emplacement, caused the major damages with extensive life losses in most of the towns surrounding the volcano. In Pompeii, the major casualties during the first phase resulted from roof collapses; during the second phase, people were killed either by physical trauma due to the kinetic energy of the flow or by suffucation because of the ash-rich atmosphere.",

The progressive removal of magma in the course of the eruption caused a slow boiling of magma within the chamber because of decompression. This in turn produced a faster and faster emission rate until the final collapse of the wall surrounding the reservoir. Scandone and Giacomelli (2001) evaluated the duration of the first phase at approximately 22 hours (several hours longer than previously estimated basing on average effusion rates). During this phase there was a steady increase in magma discharge rate. The second and most destructive phase with the massive emplacement of the major pyroclastic flows and surges lasted only about 5-6 hours.",

So a total of 1044 victims were recovered inside 2/3 of the city of Pompeii (the excavated part). Other 100 victims are estimated on the basis of many groups of scattered bones. Finally, considering the regions partially excavated (I, III, IV, V, IX) an estimate of 464 corpses still buried is obtained. Furthermore, it is meaningful to document the amount of victims with respect to their location (e.g. inside or outside the buildings). Most of the corpses within the pumice fall deposit were found inside buildings (80% as shown in Table 1), whereas of the 650 corpses recovered in the PDCs deposit 334 were found inside buildings and 316 outdoor (Table 1). Luongo et al. (2002b), on the basis of recent excavation, state that all human casts in the PDCs deposit lie over the well-recognisable lithic-rich unit D, enclosed within unit E (Figure 2). These corpses are mostly intact and only few corpses are partially or fully dismembered. In the still preserved outcrops of Pompeii and in the photographs of the Pompeii Archive, most of the casts lay prone in the attempt to shelter their face; it is noteworthy that in some places (e.g. garden of fugitives, Regio I, Insula 21; Stabian house, Regio I Insula 22) human casts show the head and the bust supported by arms, with this raised part of the body at higher stratigraphic level within E1.",

Within six hours from the beginning of the eruption the roofs and part of the walls of the buildings had collapsed under the pumice load. By the morning of 25 August most structures were seriously damaged; the pumice fall deposit, generally 3 m thick, totally buried the lower part of the buildings. The percentage of victims (38%) found in this deposit at Pompeii is anomalously high with respect to a mean of 4% of deaths caused by tephra fallout in the last four centuries during explosive eruptions (Blong, 1984;Tanguy et al., 1999). This high percentage of deaths is possibly due to the attempt of some people to take shelter into buildings where roofs and walls collapsed under the load of the pyroclastic material. The small percentage of people found dead outdoor within the pumice fall deposit was probably killed by the crumbling roof tiles or by the largest lithic fragments following ballistic paths.",

Possibly, the parental pyroclastic current ran over the city with a low-temperature, dilute frontal part settling progressively few centimetres of ash. The rear part of the current had a non-uniform behaviour in terms of concentration, possibly due to the canalization of the basal part of the current along the longitudinal walls of the buildings. Inside these areas the current showed a greater destructive power, flattening most of the (especially transversal) walls, standing out of the pumice fallout deposit, in its north-south path. In the areas outside the channels the current had essentially a depositional behaviour engulfing the city and suffocating the inhabitants. These opposed behaviour of the PDC in very close areas testify to the different kinetic conditions undergone by the Pompeii inhabitants and hence the different physical integrity of their corpses. Observations on objects, cloths, frescoes and skeletons rule out the possibility that burn injuries contributed to kill Pompeii inhabitants, as recently proposed for Herculaneum inhabitants (Capasso et al., 2000;Mastrolorenzo et al., 2001). Furthermore, the proposed non-uniform behaviour of PDCs, due to the interaction with the urban structures, justifies the described different state of destruction of the buildings throughout the city.",
