Pompeii (2005) explores life in the Colonia Veneria Pompeiana, a provincial Italian city, in the middle of the first century CE, during the period prior to the eruption of Vesuvius in 69 CE. The World That Never Was (2009) offers an account of the Anarchist movement and its complex relationship with the police and intelligence services across an international diaspora during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, beginning with the Paris Commune of 1871.",

Research in archives across Europe and America for The World That Never Was revealed unrecognized patterns of political association and police provocation, for example; in Pompeii, a reconsideration of neglected archaeological records in the context of new excavations suggested novel insights into social mobility in the first century CE. However, I shall consider the original intellectual contribution made by the books only quite briefly. The approach I have adopted in this critical consideration of the books rests rather on my assertion that they offer an equal contribution to knowledge through their innovative approach to the process of constructing historical narratives.",

The change in the roles of author and reader suggested by interactive forms, and how this may be accommodated in an analogue text, is of particular interest.

In this, I was inspired by the microhistorical work of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Natalie Zemon Davis, Robert Darnton and Carlo Ginzburg. 2 Roger Chartier has observed of Ginzburg's The Cheese and the Worms how 'it is on this reduced scale, and probably only on this scale, that we can understand, without deterministic reduction, the relationship between systems of belief, of values and representations on one side, and social affiliations on the other'. 3 The attraction of recovering the experience of the past through the study of marginal individuals resonated with me.

An 'Inhabited Television' research project, on which I worked as virtual world dramaturge, had involved Channel 4 as the broadcast partner. 4 One proposal for the final deliverable was a participatory history series, on the model of the recent The 1900 House, which would be filmed in a virtualworld model of Pompeii. As with much of the research I was involved in at the time, its ambitions were some years in advance of the technology. 5 The commissioning editors at Channel 4 recognised this, but instead wanted a Pompeii programme that took advantage of the new affordability of Computer Generated Imagery. 6 The result was an 80-minute drama-documentary called The Private Lives of Pompeii, which I researched, wrote and associate-produced. 7 The programme was an account of the social history of the city, which interspersed expert interviews with scenes that dramatised the interwoven stories of fictional characters who represented a cross-section of that society.

Even Davis's Return of Martin Guerre is embroidered around two independent and near contemporary records of the historical events: Coras's Arrest Memorable and Le Sueur's Historia. Moreover, in Davis's aim of recreating 'the hidden world of peasant sentiment and aspiration', she uses the Coras as a point of departure for research that draws on sources including notarial contracts and registers of Parlementary sentences, both of which afford her exemplary insights into the habits and mentalitÃ© of members of the local society. Although the only literary sources of the period for peasant life are from the comic theatre, which Davis regrets 'is limited in its psychological register and in the range of situations in which villagers are placed', these comedies nevertheless yield insights when considered alongside and against other records. Davis's work, however, is rendered contentious for academic historians, and more accessible for other readers, by her decision that where she cannot find her 'individual man or woman' in the archives, the account offered would be 'part my invention, but held tightly in check by the voices of the past'. 9 I had recruited Ray Laurence as historical consultant for the television documentary.",

Moreover, documentation from the excavations is now widely dispersed, making the provenance of much of the material evidence uncertain.

Determining even a basic sequence within which events and durations of activity within the social and political networks could be organised was hugely complex.

The location of a graffito in which a lowly client asserted their support for a named elite political candidate was far more meaningful if understood in relation to the position in the city of houses or businesses with which each could be associated, even more so in relation to the house of the candidate's father who had manumitted the client from slavery a decade earlier. At times the textual and the material evidence coincided in space: an amphora bearing a merchant's stamp found near a wall painting by the same hand as one in another building. At others, the telling information was material alone: the degree of damage suffered by a family's house in the earthquake; the quality of the brickwork repair that indicated poverty, or haste, or delay; alterations in the water supply infrastructure that suggested shifting social status. 13 One literary account of life in the area has survived, Petronius's Satyricon, but its satirical register and quite possibly propagandist intent, lacking any comparison to anchor it, make it as unreliable as the classical histories of Cassius Dio, Suetonius and Tacitus, written with political agendas whose nuance is lost. And yet, to the informed ear, everywhere in the ruined city voices break through from the past -out of the fine grain of evidence found in the graffiti, and the crumbling walls of the houses themselvesamounting to a clamour. Since the written evidence is often informal in character, and decay does not differentiate by social standing, whispers of the 'voices from below' can be discerned too: women and slaves.",

Pompeii was a small town in provincial Italy on the periphery of the vacation resorts in the Bay of Naples frequented by rich Romans. The Roman world of the first century CE, however, was both centralised and integrated, with trade flowing in and out of Pompeii from its immediate environs, its regional neighbours, from Rome but also from the great littoral cities of the Mediterranean and, beyond them, along trade routes into Africa and Asia. A marginal provincial city was not isolated from events at the national and imperial level. A narrative history of such a place must relate the micro to the macro, yet in the case of Pompeii those connections are tenuous, the density of data found locally being hugely disproportionate to that from the rest of the Empire. To speculate at such a large scale carries inherent risks of overstatement, and the relationship of narrative and evidence must be especially carefully managed.",

I had earlier explored ideas for possible books about the radical tradition in England, the history of utopianism, and Belle Ã‰poque Paris, but had not found a narrative approach to any of these that seemed sufficiently interesting. Similarly, I had probed but dismissed the possibility of a book about the individual experience of the national anxieties manifest in late nineteenthcentury British fiction around foreign infiltration and invasion plans, suggested by memories of an essay by Norman Sherry on the origins of Conrad's The Secret Agent. 16 These ideas coalesced, quite suddenly, in the autumn of 2001, in response to two very different external stimuli: my reading of an advance copy of Jenny Uglow's The Lunar Men and the attack on the World Trade Centre. 17 Coincidentally, earlier that year I had begun to research the recent history of international terrorism, notably the work of Walter Laquer and papers by Richard Bach Jensen, for another possible project. 18 The events of September 2001 suggested a possible reframing of the early history of anarchism that considered the terroristic violence promulgated by some of its proponents in relation to the ideology's utopian aims. The intention would be to understand the human factors that determined how anarchism had come to be perceived by posterity, distinguishing the historical movement from the reputation it acquired.

It would be a group biography that ebbed and flowed, in which certain periods in certain places might allow something approximating microhistorical study. I envisaged a study of subversion and surveillance, of interwoven networks of revolutionary activism and its policing, that would attempt to unpick the tapestry of fictionalisation that had been cast over the events of the period. In so doing, it would seek to reveal a history of the anarchist movement. It would relate the microcosm of interpersonal relationships in particular episodes of its development; the sparser mesonetworks that spanned larger spatial, temporal and sociometric divides, and whose effects could be discerned at the aggregated level of group action; and the macrocosmic perspective on the influence and perception of the movement on wider society. Part group biography and part microhistory, implicating cultural history and the study of the imaginary, it would allow me to fulfill my ambitions as a writer of narrative history in a particular mode.",

      "text": "As with Pompeii, the most immediate challenges concerned scope and scale. By the end of the nineteenth century, the anarchist movement was a global phenomenon which, whilst unevenly distributed, was also sustained through exile and dispersal in the face of persecution. It had ideological roots that some have traced back to the Anabaptists of the sixteenth century, and it fizzled throughout the twentieth century without decisive moments of rupture or a clear point of resolution. Associated challenges included what framework and principles I should apply in constructing the narrative, again without the guidance of any conventionally recognised through-line of, for example, an individual life, or any meta-narrative other than one that simplistically demonised or celebrated the anarchist movement. Which were the nodes in the network -people, places, occurrences -in relation to which the myriad possible strands of activity might be filtered, and around which they might be most revealingly organised? I planned TWTNW, as I had Pompeii, in extreme detail. The process of researching and shaping the book, up to the moment when writing began, involved constant iteration between the multiple elements that had to be accommodated in the construction of its narrative: durations of time, locations, characters, occurrences, and ideas. First the timespan was determined, approximating the adulthood of the generation of anarchist thinkers and activists who were the heirs of Bakunin (whose international profile and influence made him a conspicuous point of departure). Next, the main protagonists began to emerge from a network model of the relationships between the human actors: strong connectors, weak connectors, bridges, and significant but surprising outliers. Henri Rochefort, for example, though anomalous in any conventional account of anarchism, recurred across the period as a weak bridge between intriguingly diverse figures. Moving outwards from these to associated nodes suggested possible secondary figures for exploration, who were of particular interest when, as in the case of agent provocateurs, they intersected otherwise distinct networks.",

      "text": "Then space and time filters were applied, to reveal physical proximity of significant individuals, whether in a city where a terrorist attack took place, or at a conference that lasted a period of days, or during an exile of years or decades. With dispersal, and in an age of rapid technological advances and infrastructural developments, the vectors of communication inevitably became of greater significance, so they too had to be mapped for how they could collapse time and space, whether by means of a sled ride, or an electric telegram, or a 'go-back' day-return ticket from England to Belgium. Wherever and whenever meaningful activity was identified in the network, the environment in which it occurred was explored in more detail. Sometimes this prompted a revised understanding that then flowed backwards, causing adjustments as it ramified through the model. Occasionally it threw up events or characters, such as the hoaxer Jogand-PagÃ¨s, also known as LÃ©o Taxil, whose co-location with and thematic relevance suggested their strategic inclusion. 20 During the five years of research, however, the multi-dimensional network model remained, taxingly, a mental one. Today, tools for visualising network analysis, similar to specialised software such as Palentir that is used for tracking criminal networks, might alleviate that particular burden. 21 Beyond the challenges involved in structuring the work, however, it was apparent from early in the research process that the challenges of engaging with the historical evidence in narrative form required a treatment that would invoke questions of interpretive authority and reader agency. The world of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and of its great cities, London and Paris above all, is abundantly documented. As with Pompeii, however, the evidence required for a detailed understanding of the specific, often self-contained anarchist subculture, and that of the police services with which it became enmeshed, was unexpectedly fragmentary and dispersed, and difficult or impossible to access and verify. In many cases, the evidential problems testified to a different kind of marginality and historical muting than that of slaves whose lives were deemed unworthy of record. Rather it was those who actively sought to remain invisible or elusive through concealment and pseudonyms, or whose transgressions of social norms encouraged their misrepresentation, or else whose activities were suppressed in the historical record or erased from it by those in positions of power with interests to protect. This elusiveness applied equally to the police and spies of different nations as to the revolutionaries, often more so.",

However, this was rarely the case. Files, whose contents senior archivists in Moscow had suggested would provide key insights, were delivered, insouciantly, empty; the high tide of glasnost was receding. In Brussels, documents that I had laboriously tracked down for the crucial links they promised had long ago been replaced by slips indicating the destruction of the original 'By Order of the Cabinet'. A four-year-long Freedom of Information battle over relevant Special Branch ledgers gained me access, finally, to several hundred pages in which every name and detail that was considered sensitive, amounting to probably nine words in every ten, had been redacted. The protection of informants' names in perpetuity was the justification given by the Special Branch and, avoiding conspiratorial conclusions, specific national security concerns may be adduced to explain other limitations on access too. The overall impression, however, was that the history that I was excavating had been buried in lime by state authorities, in the past but also the present, who were determined that the truth about certain activities should be unrecoverable. 24 To attempt to reconstruct that history in narrative form, as I intended, would require a strategy towards the unreliable nature of the evidence, and the identifiable lacunae in it, that was more sophisticated than that required in reconstructing Pompeian society, since it was apparently more accessible. Once again, therefore, questions of textual authority and reader agency were of practical as well as theoretical concern. A fine-grain narrative history of anarchism and its policing which took the reader into the sensibility of the time would inevitably entail authorial speculation and surmise, to the point where the book became, in part, a history of the imaginary. Finding a way for the text to signal its own unreliability, inviting sceptical agency on the part of the reader, would therefore be essential. This invitation to scepticism seemed an appropriate response to the overabundance of certainty characterising the new 'War on Terror' that provided the background to the writing of the book.",

And if the past did not illuminate the present, then perhaps a contemporary consciousness could cast light in the other direction. This was Le Roy Ladurie's hope in 1979, on publishing Carnival, his microhistory of the massacre in Romans during the Dauphine revolt. At that time it had been the Iranian Revolution that he thought might inform readings of Carnival, towards a better understanding of 'how four centuries ago, in the France of 1580, reactionary Catholicism and the revolutionary spirit formed their odd couple'. 25 I regarded both books, from the beginning, as affording an opportunity for me to gain insight, at scale, into the authorial processes involved in constructing narrative history: insight of the kind needed for the design of digital systems to mediate historical narrative construction. As I have said, the choice of their subject matter, and the approach I took in planning their narratives, was informed both intentionally and inadvertently by my prior work in interactive narrative, most particularly by my design of a story engine for a project called Gnosis (see Appendix p.63). As discussed, the idea for Pompeii derived indirectly from plans for an unrealised digital project. In the case of The World That Never Was, I hoped the book might become the centrepiece of a collaborative online experiment that would allow readers to construct narratives through the data space that it surveyed.

Its narrative can position itself through the use of recognisable signifiers of genre. The citation of extrinsic authority in the analysis of factual verifiability, for example, would indicate the genre of 'scholarly authority'. Other texts might use distinct configurations of space and time, comprising 'chronotopes' of the kind that Bakhtinian theory proposes as the defining feature of genre. 7 For example, transitions in space and time might be arranged to present an historical narrative in which suspense is deployed as a narrative strategy of factual discovery. 'A sequence of events can be narrated as a tragedy or as satire (farce) or romance (etc.),' Hayden White argued, 'and there is no way of proving that one of these is the right way of narrating it.' 8 Genre and other kinds of affiliation may be signified by paratextual elements too, as GÃ©rard Genette has described. 9 A title and cover design are examples inherent to the book in codex form, though others, such as illustrations and critical apparatus, are common. Different readers will decode the complex interplay of signifying elements in and around an historical narrative variously, bringing their own biases, preconceptions and expectations to the task.

      "text": "In bringing what Alan Munslow has described as 'deconstructionist consciousness' to my practice as an author of narrative historical texts, I apply a habit of creative thinking rooted in the pragmatic imperatives of my particular practice. 10 This was eclectically informed, above all, by the narrative theories of Umberto Eco, Tsvetlan Todorov, Roland Barthes and Paul Ricoeur, among others. However, despite the deconstructionist and semiological character of my theoretical position, it is not defined by any ideological adherence to what Richard Evans has diagnosed as a 'hyper-relativism and scepticism about history's validity as an intellectual enterprise'. 11 Rather, the origins of my approach to writing history are to be found in my previous work with computationally mediated forms of interactive narrative. Where expertise is invested in a computer system with the intention of generating narrative outcomes, effective human authorship requires the highest level of self-consciousness when designing the data model and the algorithms used to engage with it. This sort of transparent self-consciousness is implicit to Herman Paul's proposal of a 'performative turn' in historical practice, 'focusing upon what historians actually do as opposed to looking at the finished product'. 12 In this context, the usefulness of a 'deconstructionist consciousness' lies in exposing the operations of the human practitioner in order for them to be externalised and codified, in the greatest possible detail and diversity. Ideally, the aim should be towards systematising the generic rather than the prescriptive: to capture not one version of narrative historical method but the principles that, applied variously and in a different combinations, may produce the widest range of outputs.",

Rather than the intellectual validity of historiographical practice per se, this agenda does involve 'hyperrelativism and scepticism' but in relation to the questions of agency and authority inherent to dynamic and emergent narratives. Indeed, transparency about the rules by which knowledge is constituted being Pierre Machery's criterion of scientific acceptance, I would argue that the ultimate effect of such an approach will be to preserve the validity of that enterprise by making historical method more transparent and accessible. 13 By these means, the formation of historical knowledge can be rehearsed and owned by the public, in an age when digital technology is rendering 'take it or leave it' performances of authority, of all kinds, ever more problematic and unsustainable.",

However, the cognitive processes involved in making history, which begin with and iterate through the formulation of questions, the marshalling of evidence, and the investigation of the patterns in that evidence, do not end there. In analogue forms, it is through their narrative expression that the version of historical truth produced by these processes becomes manifest and amenable to dialogical testing. And yet the construction of narrative is not distinct from those processes that appear to precede it. Rather, they are involuted through iterations that are usually opaque to the reader and perhaps to the authors themselves.",

In such a dynamic conception of narrative history, the particular subject of historical enquiry remains at the core of the text produced. Recognising that the subject contains no latent, definitive version of itself that can be rendered as narrative, an ideal system of this kind will allow a multiplicity of readers as co-constructors. This may include a reader who pursues a strategy in their interactive 'reading' that evokes Robin Collingwood's belief in a narrative discoverable through informed empathy with the past, another who interrogates the correlation of historical processes to a hypothecated selection of data and builds a narrative from their conclusions, a third who seeks a phenomenological perspective that constellates the subjectivities that can be recovered from a historical moment whilst preserving their indeterminacy. 15 Or indeed, a single reader who compares and relates all three, and more, swooping from the microcosm to the macrocosmic view, relating the individual to society to larger historical trends, in and across time.",

This is most likely to occur, however, if the activity of history-making is undertaken with the sceptical openness and self-reflexivity of the ideal scholar. Magisterially authored historical narratives in analogue form inherently discourage such habits of mind when reading, despite the validating effect of an active hermeneutic within historical discourse. In these terms, it is the conventions of the form, primarily, which restrict and inhibit the agency of the reader, and through which the author imposes their own limitations on reading strategies. Analogue forms are less flexible than those that digital makes possible, since any formal fluidity is constrained by their material fixity, their texts amenable only to mental rather than actual manipulation.

      "text": "In 1967, Barthes wrote of 'this narrative style of history, which draws its \"truth\" from the careful attention to narrative, the architecture of articulations and the abundance of expended elements (known, in this case, as \"concrete details\").' 16 The model of historiography to which he referred, dominant to the exclusion of almost all others, was the century-old realist novel, which Hegel had described as 'the epic of the middle-class world'. 17 Emphasising 'mimesis with an epistemological dominant', as described by Brian McHale, the core intent of the realist novel was closely identical with that of historical method: to offer an accurate representation of the world, in which features are emphasised only to accentuate the truthfulness of the narrative. 18 'So the circle of paradox is complete,' Barthes had continued. 'Narrative structure, which was originally developed within the cauldron of fiction (in myths and the first epics) becomes at once the sign and the proof of reality.' 19 Frank Ankersmit even catalogued the stylistic attributes of the realist novel for the purposes of historiography, concluding, 'Time exposition is extremely well-documented and informative, and demonstrates a painful awareness of the writer's subjectivity; a judicious rationing of facts is strived for, the mentality is skeptical; the plot is even-paced and non-dramatic; a dry and direct, transparent style is used, resulting in a \"hurried\" prose that has no patience with superfluous matter, and, lastly, the intentions are didactic'. 20 This mode of historiographical account was not necessarily exclusive, even when Barthes wrote the Discourse of History. Indeed, it might be argued that the realist novel itself was constantly in flux and various enough to accommodate considerable latitude as a model for the writing of history. Nevertheless, the model of the realist novel was dominant and remains so, half a century on, despite the developments in historiographical theory that have eroded its foundations. These critiques gained purchase during the 1970s through a number of seminal works, including Paul Veyne's Comment on Ã©crit l'histoire (1971), Hayden White's Metahistory (1973), and Michel de Certeau's L'Ã©criture de l'histoire (1975), which inform much of my work in representing the past. For Veyne, history 'remains fundamentally an account, and what is called explanation is nothing but the way in which the account is arranged in a comprehensible plot', while White considered that what historians 'actually wrote was less a report of what they found in their research than of what they had imagined the object of their original interest to consist of'. 21 That concern with historical bias would be pursued further by Jacques RanciÃ¨re in The Names of History: On the Poetics of Knowledge, praised by White for its 'very original attempt â€¦ to disclose \"the unconscious\" of historical discourse, everything that had to be repressed in order to make possible the specific kinds of historical discourse met with in our culture in our age'. 22 Some of the myriad presumptions underpinning those discourses are more fundamental than others, especially concerning time. As Stefan Tanaka points out in Pasts in a Digital Age, modern conceptions of history did not arise until the late eighteenth century, when people began writing about the past in a linear, chronological structure, that went beyond the sequential chronicle to elaborate social causation. 23 Reinhart Koselleck traces this formation of the chronotope of 'historical time' to 1800 (a 'watershed' or sattelzeit moment in intellectual history) and its problematisation to Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard's La condition post-modern. 24 As Carlyle had written, in 1840: one 'can observe, still more can record, only the series of impressions â€¦while the things done were often simultaneous: the things done were not a series but a group.' 25 A century on, the historians of the Annales school challenged assumptions of 'uniform time as the medium through which historical phenomena have their existence', arguing that it 'imposes a continuity and homogeneity on diverse phenomena'. 26 Other rhythms, 'slow but perceptible' or even appearing 'almost changeless', had to be set alongside and above Levi-Strauss's 'history of historians', which was preoccupied with individual lives and overvalued elite agency. 27 These rhythms demanded a new historiography that was not located within 'a supposedly even and objective flow of time'. 28 Even these abstract conceptions of time, however, betray culturally specific expectations of chronology. For de Certeau the two are not synonymous. 'Recast in the mold of a taxonomic ordering of things,' he wrote, 'chronology becomes the alibi of time, a way of making use of time without reflecting on it.' 29 Agricultural societies perceive time as cyclical, aligned with the rhythm of the seasons. The ritual of holy days modulates the emotional intensity of these rhythms, as Mircea Eliade, for example, observes, although for him 'the one is an evanescent duration, the other a \"succession of eternities\" â€¦ the periodical tune of the calendar flows in a closed circle'. 30 Ã‰mile Durkheim, however, had already suggested that the interpolation of intervals of sacred time into the continuities of profane event time arose from the need of religions to differentiate the two spheres. 31 Industrialised societies implemented the differentiation of time in other terms, through the strict division of work and leisure, which formalised time as a social property and one that was unevenly distributed. 'To be master of one's own time, to control the time of others,' Chartier wrote, paraphrasing Pierre Bourdieu, 'to have no control over time and thus leave it to games of chance: all are incorporated modalities of the relation to time that express the power of the dominant and the vulnerability of the dominated. ' 32 This industrial conception of time was enculturated through the 'clock time' that began to regulate social practices, while the advent of the railway timetable promoted temporal homogeneity across technological societies by the turn of the twentieth century.",

Only through the analysis of this process, in a state of endless becoming, he argues, can we apprehend the human sense of 'presence' in time. 36 That apprehension is expanded by Edward Soja, who argues for an understanding of 'spatiality as simultaneously â€¦ a social product (or outcome) and a shaping force (or medium) in social life'. 37 It is at least forty years since such ideas began to permeate the social sciences and latterly the humanities. The application of GIS technologies to historical study, Ann Kelly Knowles has demonstrated, contributed to that interest and has accelerated it. 38 The 'spatial turn' in historical studies saw increased attention paid to the encoding of power relations in landscape and urban space, a new scholarly interest in real and imagined landscapes, and in the relationships between what Jo Guldi has described as 'the microcosms of everyday life and the macrocosms of global flows'. 39 In his seminal work The Historical Novel, GyÃ¶rgy Lukacs offers a Marxist interpretation of how the realist novel evolved, in the context of a capitalist economy, into a form that, by representing 'the concrete (i.e. historical) significance of time and place, to social conditions, and so on â€¦ created this spatio-temporal (i.e. historical) character of people and places'. 40 Yet Michel Foucault fundamentally reframed even the notion of an'event' as something that occurs in complex, dynamic relationships of space and time. 41 It becomes, 'not a decision, a treaty, a reign, or a battle, but the reversal of a relationship of forces, the usurpation of power, the appropriation of a vocabulary turned against those who had once used it, a feeble domination that poisons itself as it grows lax, the entry of a masked \"other\".' 42 Can Lukacs' notion of historicity still effectively determine the narrative form in which the past is to be represented, then, when the significance of time and place to social and cultural circumstances is so differently understood?",

      "text": "Is such an undertaking possible, or does it multiply the complex causation around events beyond the point of viable retrieval or narration, in the way that Furet believed that narrative became an invalid vehicle for an historical account because the temporality it represented was 'made up of a series of discontinuities described in the mode of the continuous'? 44 One answer may be suggested, at a local level, by the task of the military historian who must avoid the temptation to 'shine too bright a light through the fog of war', as Timothy Synder wrote in a review of Antony Beevor's Ardennes 1944. 45 'Beevor,' he wrote, 'has the art of preserving the individual perspective on the battlefield while placing it among the perspectives of platoon, regiment, division, commanders, politicians and civilians. The pointillist whole that emerges is convincing as a portrait of war and startling in its detail.' Might such impressionistic license be granted to non-military historians, too, who similarly seek to allow readers to 're-experience the social and human motives which led men to think, feel and act just as they did in historical reality,' and evoke 'the poetic awakening of the people who figured in those events,' such as Lukacs argues that the historical novel should? 46 Ginzburg saw this hope expressed in the 'cognitive wager' that the (predominantly) factual genre of 'Italian microhistory' offered its readers, through its 'accentuation of the constructive moment inherent in the research â€¦ combined with an explicit rejection of the skeptical implications (postmodernist, if you will) so largely present in European and American historiography of the 1980s and early 1990s'. Its self-consciousness concerned, 'the identification of the object and its importance; the elaboration of the categories through which it is analyzed; the criteria of proof; the stylistic and narrative forms by which the results are transmitted to the reader'. 47 For Giovanni Levi, Ginzburg's colleague in the microhistorical project, its primary purpose was ideological: to respond to the crisis of the 'great Marxist and functionalist systems' that shaped much historiography of the time. 48 Ginzburg, writing in reflective mode, recollects how the alternative, personal inspiration for the endeavour lay in the example of two very different literary innovators, one (the nouveau romancier Raymond Queneau) subverting, the other, Leo Tolstoy, extending the realist model of the novel. 'Tolstoy's grand and intrinsically unrealizable project,' wrote Ginzburg, was 'the reconstruction of the numerous relationships that linked Napoleon's headcold before the battle of Borodino, the disposition of the troops, and the lives of all the participants in the battle, including the most humble soldier. In Tolstoy's novel the private world (peace) and the public (war) first run along parallel lines, now they intersect â€¦' 49 Ginzburg is aware that the narrative assimilation of disparate, fragmentary data was how Tolstoy 'communicate [s] to the reader the physical, palpable certainty of reality' that can only take place 'in the realm of invention' that is precluded to the historian. Yet in Ginzburg's aspiration to write comprehensive history, he is not deterred by any incompatibility of method. Rather, he seeks a form in which the 'lacunae or misrepresentations' encountered in the research process become integral to the account, accepting 'the limitations while exploring the gnoseological implications and transforming them into a narrative element'. 50 To address the narrative challenges raised by the incompatibilities of Tolstoyan ambition and historiographical rectitude, Ginzburg suggests that historians seek alternatives to the certainties implicit in omniscient, authorial narration in the work of 'Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Robert Musil'. 51 However, it was in the historical musings of film theorist Siegfried Kracauer, posthumously published as History: The Last Things before the Last, that Ginzburg discovered 'the best introduction to microhistory,' expressed through the grammar of another medium entirely. For Kracauer, in Ginzburg's paraphrase, the solution was to be found in cinematic grammar: 'a constant back-and-forth between micro-and macrohistory, between close-ups and extreme long shots, so as to continually thrust back into discussion the comprehensive vision of the historical process through apparent exceptions and cases of brief duration.' 52 In a recent lecture, 'Big Data, Small Data and Meaning', Tim Hitchcock surveyed the current state of activity and discussion around the notion of the Macroscope, currently a design fiction of an ideal instrument of historical investigation. 53 Such a tool promises, he noted, quoting Katy BÃ¶rner, 'a visualisation tool that allows a single data point to be both visualised at scale in the context of a billion other data points, and drilled down to its smallest compass' that will 'let us observe what is at once too great, slow, or complex for the human eye and mind to notice and comprehend.' 54 This raises concerns, however, for what might be overlooked: 'the tiny fragments of everyday life -the narratives of everyday experience' that have been used by Bourdieu and de Certeau, among others 'to build a compelling framework illustrating the currents and sub-structures of power'; the 'closely described lives, built from fragments and details, made emotionally compelling by being woven into ever more precise fabrics of explanation.' 55 These are important concerns that recognise how knowledge formation is shaped by models of historiographical process that may be hard-wired into the tools of enquiry. They demand an approach to computational history that addresses the design of the systems through which these models will be deployed, considering user needs across a spectrum of scale and from a multiplicity of perspectives.",

Ultimately, those forms will incorporate a reproducible performance of the research methods by which the historical knowledge that they represent is constituted, and ideally this form will appeal a wide range of users. As demonstrated by the inspiration that Ginzburg found in Tolstoy, narrative innovation may illuminate new historical practice and new kinds of knowledge formation, while imposing rigorous demands on how the solutions to the challenges it raises are refined.

This interest echoes the contemporary experience of online communication and society, of which Foucault wrote, presciently, 'We are at a moment, I believe, when our experience of the world is less that of a long life developing through time than that of a network that connects points and intersects with its own skein'. 56 It also reflects the increasing availability of historical data in high volume, onto which network visualisation provides a gratifying window, representing myriad associations that would be infinitely laborious to trace without such tools. Anyone who has been asked to appreciate a sprawling spider diagram will recognise the bewilderment that often ensues, but network analysis using visualisation techniques is becoming ever more sophisticated in identifying significance in the graph. However, such methods remain of limited efficacy in tracing and recording sequences of causation, for example, or as means to expose narrative or emplotment in the information they display.",

      "text": "Guidance may be suggested by pioneering literary studies that are beginning to uncover how narratological approaches could illuminate the complex networks of spatial, temporal and other forms that shape societies and their narrative representation. As well as offering a variable scale, the Macroscope must also allow relationships to be traced within and between forms. It must embrace an understanding of 'network society' such as that proposed by Manuel Castells, which sees the 'space of places' transformed into a 'space of flows', and in which space-time relationships turn, in Wolfgang Schmale's words, into 'flowing, unbounded categories'. 57 In her recent book Forms: Whole, Rhythm, Hierarchy, Network, Caroline Levine theorises how a multiplicity of forms, in different configurations and with varying affordances -interdependent, overlapping and colliding -afford a common basis for new analytical models across social and literary studies. She cites the drama series The Wire as a possible 'new model for literary and cultural studies scholarship' in that it 'conceptualises social life as both structured and rendered radically unpredictable by large numbers of social forms, including bounded wholes, rhythms, hierarchies, and networks. Dependent on a narrative logic that traces the effects of each formal encounter on the next, it refuses to posit a deep, prior, metaphysical model of causality to explain the world. By tracking vast numbers of social patterns as they meet, reroute, and disrupt one another, The Wire examines the world that results from a plurality of forms at work.' 58 Levine also rehearses a new analysis of Dickens's Bleak House that casts 'narrative persons less as powerful and symbolic agents in their own right than as moments in which complex and invisible social forces cross' while observing that 'in order to represent a world of networks, the text must refuse totality'. 59 The webs of interconnectedness may be glimpsed and hinted at but cannot ever be more than partial.",

      "text": "'After the novel, and subsequently cinema, privileged narrative as the key form of cultural expression of the modern age, the computer age introduces its correlate -the database,' the media theorist Lev Manovich claimed in his 1999 article Database as Symbolic Form. 62 He boldly asserted that the database was itself a medium immanent with potential, which 'represents the world as a list of items', and is in direct conflict with narrative, which merely produces 'a cause-and-effect trajectory of seemingly unordered items (events)'. It was through the interfaces to a database that the digital text became manifest but, for Manovich, the design conventions of the time were too enslaved to the sequential conventions of cinema, 'the dominant semiological order of the twentieth century'. The result was a linear, linked text, stepping from one screen (or 'scripton') to the next, through links. It was, Manovich argued, referencing semiological theory, a syntagmatic form masquerading as paradigmatic: the explicit narrative statement discovered in the database was prioritised over the implicit, imagined possibility of narrative. 63 In an act of media archaeology avant la lettre, undertaken at around the same time that I was researching the value of Eisenstein's theory of montage as a principle of 'associative' interaction, Manovich discovered in the early Russian film documentarist Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera his ideal cinematic expression of an approach that reversed the hierarchy of paradigm and syntagm. It 'traverses its database in a particular order to construct an argument. Records drawn from a database and arranged in a particular order become a picture of modern life -but simultaneously an argument about this life, an interpretation of what these images, which we encounter every day, every second, actually mean.' Its 'banal, mechanical catalog of subjects which one can expect to find' in the city of the 1920s were rendered into 'anything but a banal experience' through the 'most amazing catalog of the film techniques contained within it'.",

      "text": "That is, the static database becomes 'dynamic and subjective' since the 'process of discovery is the film's main narrative and it is told through a catalog of discoveries being made'. 64 Might such techniques be applied to historiography, or else what alternative techniques and strategies could achieve similar effects? One of the most striking attempts in recent decades at a new kind of (text-based) historiography founded on principles similar to the paradigmatic database is Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time, published the year before Manovich's essay. Gumbrecht believed that a new 'configuration of time' was replacing the mode of 'historical thinking' that had persisted since the nineteenth century, but that our knowledge of the past remained constrained by the discredited narrative forms of historical writing. The chronotope of 'historical time', in which time was the 'absolute agent of change', was obsolete since 'the presence with its synchronicities grow[s] ever wider'. In response, Gumbrecht set out to restore an appropriate sense of 'presence' to historicity, a quality of being-in-theworld that he considered to have been lost in the humanities' focus on interpretation. 65 The fascinating result was a work of fifty-one chapters arranged into three sections: 'Arrays' (eg. 'Engineers', 'Gramophones', 'Ocean Liners'), 'Codes' (binaries such as 'Authenticity vs Artificiality') and 'Codes Collapsed' (eg. 'Individual = Collectivity (Leader)'). 'Each entry,' Gumbrecht explained, 'is supposed to reach maximum surfacefocus and concreteness â€¦ the style and the structure of the entries â€¦ determined by the individual phenomena that each of them thematizes.' 66 The reader is invited to begin anywhere, follow cross-references, and end anywhere. It is an ingenious work of analogue hypertext and, to my mind, remarkably successful in its aims: its 'scriptons' offer a model of composing multivalent knowledge, their individual meanings variously amplified by whichever the reader arrives at next, the whole producing a sense of historical immersion. 67 However, Gumbrecht admits in the accompanying 'User's Guide' that its synchronic and hypertextual form eschews not only unilinearity but coherence and, with it, closure. In this, arising from its lack of emplotment, 1926 is an historiographical anti-narrative of the sort that White states, with reference to modernist texts, 'would be in Ricoeur's estimation a contradiction in terms'. 68 My reading of Ricoeur's Time and Narrative had both influenced my aspirations as a writer of historiographical metafiction and my subsequent dissatisfaction with hypertext, and determination to develop other principles of digital narrative. From the perspective of historiographical practice, rather than fictional experimentation, Ricoeur's ideas similarly suggest the need for a poetics of digital history that ensures that certain narrative criteria are met as a fundamental requirement of its validity. Temporality is, for Ricoeur, 'the structure of existence that reaches language in narrativity', while narrativity is 'the language structure that has temporality as its ultimate referent'. 69 It is, therefore, through narrative and emplotment that historical events find their equivalent structure and can become part of the general discourse. As White explains: 'By emplotment, a sequence of events is \"configured\" (\"grasped together\") in such a way as to represent \"symbolically\" what would otherwise be unutterable in language, namely, the ineluctable \"aporetic\" nature of the human experience of time.' 70 It had been a principle of my earlier work with digital media that computational systems invested with 'authorial expertise' could shape the dynamic construction of narrative traces through data space in a manner that ensured an experience of both coherence and closure: two key elements of a satisfying story. In these terms, the interactive medium therefore holds the potential to both preserve that correspondence between emplotment and the deep structures of temporality, as Riceour understands it, and, simultaneously, expose for negotiation that aporia: the doubt and uncertainty about the status of the correspondence, and whether the preferred narrative is the most truthful historical account. As a rhetorical device, implicit in Ricoeur's use of the term, aporia implies an appeal to an audience for confirmation or reassurance. In the case of an interactive medium, user and system become one another's audience, engaged in a dialogic process whose aim is to constellate the elements of the narrative -including, in Levine's terms, the multiple forms that underlie it -into the preferred narrative arrangement, while simultaneously recognising the possibility of alternatives. The static narrative text becomes one in process. The process is playful and ironic, since it requires the reader or user to hold in mind more than one idea or possible world, which may be contradictory and are certainly ambiguous.",

      "text": "In this process, theories of the 'storyworld', the 'chronotope' and of 'possible worlds' on which I drew in my earlier work with fictional narratives in analogue and digital form (see Appendix, pp.64, 65, 66), seem to me highly pertinent. Ludomir Dolozel has addressed the application of possible worlds theory, writing that, 'Historical texts, constrained by the requirement of truth-valuation, construct historical worlds which are models of the actual world's past. One and the same historical event or sequence of events (historical period, life, and so on) can be modelled by various historical worlds. In a critical testing, these worlds are assessed as more or less adequate to the actual past'. 71 Two 'semantically unhomogeneous' worlds (Dolozel's words) can, JoaquÃ­n Lorente explains, 'be postulated to explain the different opinions and reactions of two individuals concerning the same section of the action'. 72 These 'transuniverse relations', Ryan writes, 'serve as a theoretical backdrop to explain the different ways in which a reader detects and makes sense of narrative unreliability.' 73 Each of these historical worlds, comprising distinct but overlapping and cognate 'ontological landscapes', has as its ultimate referent the temporality of the 'actual world's past'. 74 The perceived identity of the two, or the discrepancy between them, allows the reader to assess the reliability of a narrative account. However, as a strategy to establish that identity, the narrated path through the storyworld (as hypothetically complete ontological model) may encompass multiple possible worlds. This equates to the heteroglossic method which Bakhtin defines as 'another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way' and in which, for him, the power of the novel originates and resides. 75 However, a work of narrative historyunable, for example, to ventriloquise imagined characters -is constrained in the means and material available to express this heteroglossia, and has an obligation to be cautious and transparent in its handling of them. The chronotopic organisation of time and space (and their subsidiary elements and affordances) and the management of transitions between chronotopes in the historical narrative afford, I would argue, the most powerful and versatile mechanism to achieve a multi-perspectival narrative. Karl SchlÃ¶gel's Moscow 1937, published in German at around the same time as The World That Never Was, is an extraordinary history of an extraordinary moment, one that was variously characterised by contemporaries as 'the whirlpool of history', 'the maelstrom', 'the Witches' Sabbath', 'the machinery of terror'. 76 It was a year, he writes, in which 'no one can say exactly where reality ceases and the imagination begins'. In the Introduction, SchlÃ¶gel articulates his aspirations for the book, the tensions between them, and the limitations of what the linear analogue form available to him can contain. 'A history that is tied to a particular time or space implicitly acknowledges the synchronicity of the non-synchronous, the coexistence and co-presence of the disparate. The location guarantees complexity. The stereoscope all-round view is designed to bring events together; it is better suited to the disparate nature of the world than is a strenuous, concentrated tunnel vision. â€¦ An all-round view sensitive to time and space sets relationships in motion that are paralysed by a more concentrated method which focuses on particular points.' 77 A comprehensive poetics of digital narrative history would allow, through a dialogic and constructionist process, an order to be imposed on that stereoscopic maelstrom that, at the same, contains its own provisionality, memorialising Ginzburg's conjectural paradigm of historical method by which clues and traces are followed towards a production of knowledge that is 'indirect, presumptive, conjectural'. 78 It would embrace a performative understanding of history-making, if only performed for an audience of one. This recalls the 'performative turn' for which Paul has argued, that focuses on the process of what historians do as opposed to the finished product. 79 Its mode and register would be variable. At one extreme it would approximate Chartier's scholarly 'theatre of erudition' which 'does not guarantee the possibility that history can produce adequate knowledge of the past', but in which, accordion to Norman Klein, 'scholarly evidence operates as special effects' and where 'the honest scholar should try to keep those fictional tracks right on the surface'. 80 At the other, fictional license would allow speculation to bleed out, beyond the lacunae that micro historians would legitimately allow it to fill.",

Irony, ambiguity, ostensible tensions between fact and fiction, and narratorial unreliability can all be deployed, with Stephan Jaeger asserting the benefit of the latter in 'exposing the performative process of making history and its infinite and incomplete nature'. Deft management of the chronotopes in the text, too, might serve this additional purpose: the genres that they constitute may be juxtaposed or blurred, encoding a signal of narrative instability for decipherment by the attentive reader. Such an effect is inherent, for example, in the genre of the fantastic, whose author, according to Edmund Little, breaches the contract with the reader by creating what he terms a Tertiary World, whose relationship to the actual world is less certain than that of the Secondary Worlds that all creative writers describe. 82 The effect produced is, for Amaryll Chanady, one of antinomy, the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes in the text. 83 For Todorov, it is 'hesitation' on the part of the reader, as they waver momentarily between a preternatural or 'marvellous' explanation of narrative events. 84 That hesitation, that instant of scepticism, is fundamental to the responsible practice of narrative historiography, and essential to introduce where the limits of evidential reliability are transgressed, for example when the subjectivities of the past are recounted, and the reader is invited to adopt greater agency in discerning the historical truth. Take this sentence: The axe fell on the block and the king's head tumbled, in the forest at full moon. The time and place, while possible in a non-fictional world, are more appropriate to fairytale than political history.

These fall into three main categories: chronotopic construction; narrative, analysis and fictionality; signalling unreliability. The specific application of the principles varies between the two books, and the categories are not discrete: an approach adopted in one category can impact another. For example, the management of chronotopic organisation in Pompeii maintains an explicit distinction between fictional narrative and analysis, while in TWTNW I aimed to integrate the two, defining a narrative mode in which analysis was implicit. This distinction, in turn, required different strategies of signalling the status and reliability of the accounts presented.",

This storyworld was glimpsed through vignettes, three in each chapter, whose fictional status was distinguished by the italicisation of the text. These evoked moments of imagined history grounded in wellresearched evidence, providing the reader with recognisable human points of identification. I used fictional strategies, such as suspense and access to the interior world of the characters, to generate narrative momentum and empathy. This entailed the additional structural consideration of character development, requiring information to be seeded about named individuals. The mechanisms for this spanned the italicised vignettes and the non-italicised analytical sections.

Jeremy Paterson appreciated how 'the lives of individual Pompeiians are reconstructed from inscriptions, graffiti, memorials, houses and decoration, and the clutter of everyday living that they left behind them.' 13 I would frame the relationship between the two distinct textures of each 'local' chapter in chronotopic terms: that notion of time-space relationships that curdle into tangible genres of narrative. 14 In the overtly fictional vignettes, time and space crystalise briefly, incarnating specific figures that otherwise exist only as speculatively assembled 'point clouds' of fragmentary data. 15 By contrast, the non-italicised sections hold in suspension the specific configurations of time and space that define event. Intermittently the constituents of this chronotope thicken too with the disputative text to reveal generic events that offer exemplary insights into the world, before rapidly deliquescing.",

However, he is more fully realised in the non-italicised, discursive sections of that chapter where the reader is: told of his home's proximity to the temple of Aesculapius, the healer deity; shown the medical instruments found there and the plaster casts of the roots of medicinal herbs from his garden; and given a survey of the medical history that relates to them. 16 Chapter 12, set in 75 CE, is the last to follow the established pattern of vignettes and analysis. Several years after the upheaval of the earthquake and the civil war, the city is seen settling into a new order: the chapter concludes with a vignette in which an official observes the last moments of a gladiatorial combat. In Chapter XII, as the book's conclusion approaches, the conventions break down. The 'imperial' chapter here comprises only two pages of inscriptions and programmata from the walls of Pompeii: the fragmentary voices by which its inhabitants would speak to the future.",

Characters who the reader has come to know are presented, in their last non-italicised moments, unencumbered with conditionality about their factual status, before resolving into the skeletal remains on which they have been based. 'It is the great achievement of this book that we feel we know these people, and their tragedy moves us,' wrote Jane Stevenson, while Alan Quinlan felt that the use of the vignettes contributed to a reading experience that was 'visceral â€¦ graphic, ambitious and compelling'. 17 Reviewing TWTNW, John Gray qualified his enthusiasm by noting that, 'Butterworth has opted to present the anarchists in a mode that emphasizes narrative over analysis ... One cannot help wishing there were more extended analysis, however, for when Butterworth does offer broader observations, they are exceptionally astute.' 18 Other reviews too, though by no means all, regretted a lack of 'analysis' and of 'intellectual context'. 19 A number of considerations influenced my decision to adopt this approach, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the historical material with which I had chosen to work. I had a strong desire, as an author, to explore the possibilities of writing a narrative history that was novelistic in its capacity to evoke individual experience and contingency, while relating ideas and behaviour across different scales of observed society. This derived, in part, from the interesting possibilities for narrative innovation suggested by my digital work, but also from a sense that Pompeii had been compromised by the self-imposed strictures of a formal distinction between narrative and analysis. I felt that to embrace a more analytical or disputative mode risked either imposing too definitive an authorial interpretation on a subject that was naturally nebulous -the quest for a perfect world, and the fears this provoked -or else amplifying the uncertainties and ambiguities that characterised the historical record to the point where narrative coherence broke down. Preston thought it 'no wonder ... that historians haven't lingered too long over some of the stars of this dotty saga'. 20 The reductive or indulgent accounts of the subject that have often shaped popular understanding seemed to derive precisely from a complacency in finding forms that could address that paradox.",

As with Pompeii, this balance of response was broadly satisfactory, except that I suspect that the book did not change minds, but instead confirmed established inclinations to open or closed patterns of thought. Unfortunately, I received no response from Karl Rove to my email asking for his response to the book, which he had included on his 'summer reading' list in 2010. 22 The one opinion that I found chastening was that offered by Sheila Rowbotham.",

What is to be done in it?' 29 However, such manipulation is unusual in factual historical narratives. Although little remarked on by reviewers, both Pompeii and TWTNW manipulate linear chronology in both subtle and overt ways.

Only on the last page of the Introduction do we return to Egypt, to discover that the Prefect's visit to Memnon shortly after the destruction of Pompeii is not only factually verifiable but, improbably, is literally written in stone: the Prefect had, like many visitors, carved his name in the base of the statue. 32 To reinforce the earlier monitory temporal destabilisation, the first 'local' chapter opens with an ending, a death that marks the chronological start of the narrative; the following 'imperial chapter' offers a further temporal jolt, first rewinding two millennia, then fast-forwarding back to the 'present' of 54 CE, from which point the temporal scheme settles into a more regular modulation.",

For fiction could so easily be confused with truth, and truth relegated to the realm of fiction.' 35 It is an explicit statement of the book's philosophy, articulated as the insight of one its main protagonists, and as such is itself a clue to other strategies that the book will adopt to achieve its objectives. This opening chapter establishes Paris as a space that exists across time, the fulcrum of anarchist ambitions since the Commune of 1871, memories of which lie suppressed beneath the glittering but unstable ground of the Belle Ã‰poque. It also identifies a number of key individuals who the reader will next encounter in their earlier youth then follow through life, and maps the relationships that will develop between them.

The syntax of the text consciously shifted too, with less conditionality, more assertion. However, in describing a possible visit to the city by Nero, I failed to find the appropriate strategy for presenting this element of the narrative as intriguing conjecture rather than established fact. 42 Invested as I was in the speculative logic of the storyworld, persuaded by certain recent discoveries of circumstantial evidence, eager for a scenario that would allow the exploration of certain thematic issues, I surmised a high probability that such a visit occurred. I justified this incaution to myself on the basis that the damnatio memoriae pronounced on Nero after his fall, which saw the official erasure of any record of his rule, would have removed the evidence. This decision offered a hostage to fortune. Despite lambasting the book for its credulity of the imperial historical sources, Beard saw further error in this deviation from their record. 43 Her review, the first published, appeared a point of reference for later reviewers, such as Ben Jarman who wrote, 'The problem is, according to some historians, that there is no firm evidence that Nero ever visited Pompeii'. 44 Others seemed to see the Beard review as requiring redress, with Jones explaining how the postulated visit enabled the book to interrogate the configurations of behaviour that it would have engendered. 45 Jones wrote of Ray Laurence and my speculation regarding the feast that may have been staged for Nero, had he visited Pompeii: 'They do so on the reasonable assumption that anyone entertaining an emperor would want to know his tastes. So they present the possible evidence for that -violent sex on the one hand, high Greek culture on the otherand prompt us to make our own judgement.' 46 The last point is key. The mode is generous and non-didactic. However, in this case I had clumsily overstepped the negotiable line between fact and imagination that I had so carefully established.",

More problematically ambiguous was the cover design commissioned by the publisher for the UK hardback. Its style was unexpected to me, and not entirely welcome, but the image made sense as a creative response to the brief. A central scene of triclinium dining was posed in direct emulation of the Roman wall painting behind it, itself taken from the House of the Chaste Lovers in Pompeii. It encoded both allusion to how the book drew on the material evidence of the ruins to recreate everyday life, and the double coding with which it challenges readers.

Whereas Miller had recognised that the author of TWTNW 'wasn't an idealist himself and has a taste for gossipy details', Leo McKinstry was not alone in perceiving an authorial ideologue whose book had a great 'failing: the moral viewpoint'; the International Socialist Review too read ventriloquism as endorsement, the book itself being 'overtly hostile to Marxism and Leninism ... rehashing the trite misrepresentation of their debates'. 61 By contrast, in noting that the author 'reckons' that 'Dostoevsky's alarmist representation of The Possessed ... provided insidious encouragement to Tsarist repression', I would like to think that Hughes-Hallett suspected that such a reductive reading of a masterpiece of literary polyphony was, in the context of the book's own approach, an ironic impersonation of partisanship. 62 Many of these assumptions suggest that, for some readers, expectations of literalism, authority and stability within a text of historical narrative -of the 'magisterial authority' that publishers often demand that 'trade' historians impersonate -had been insufficiently disrupted. Hostility to TWTNW was greatest from those with a confirmed ideological stance of their own, whether from left or right (in the US, anarchist and libertarian views were sometimes hard to differentiate). The greatest criticisms of Pompeii came from classical historians and archaeologists with an academic background, although these were balanced by the enthusiasm of others with a similar position. In the two most notable cases of hostility, Beard and Ling, the reviewers had either recently published or were preparing books on the same subject, had expert knowledge but may have felt some emotional and intellectual ownership.

I had intended that Pompeii and TWTNW should successfully advance a more sophisticated way of addressing provisional and partial knowledge, eschewing the obvious irony of an overtly postmodern form such as that used by Hopkins in favour of other, more nuanced strategies. Rather than tell readers that the historical record was unreliable, and rendered more so through the fact of its written presentation, the books would rehearse that inevitable unreliability for them, through examples of possible narrative construction. They would present 'open texts' where the critical imagination of the reader met that of the author, and where it was trusted and enabled, not to passively assimilate knowledge or reach any 'correct' conclusion but to exercise itself on uncertainty.

It interwove six time frames, across three thousand years, and explored echoes of Edwardian geopolitics in the late twentieth century, specifically around internecine war in the Balkans, tracing parallels that resonated through a complex system of motifs.

At around the same time, the author Robert Coover had alerted readers of the New York Times Book Review to the transformative potential of hypertext. 'Fluidity, contingency, indeterminacy, plurality, discontinuity are the hypertext buzzwords of the day,' he wrote, 'and they seem to be fast becoming principles, in the same way that relativity not so long ago displaced the falling apple.' 5 The principles of hypertext have since become familiar through the hot linking between pages across the world wide web that subvert boundaries and hierarchies, and have indeed transformed reading culture.

'The form of the text is rhythmic,' Coover enthused, 'looping on itself in patterns and layers that gradually accrete meaning, just as the passage of time does in one's lifetime.' While working on Merciless, I had diagrammed the complex structure of the novel across multiple wall charts. The conception of narrative that this revealed -as a matrix of stories, themes and tropes, all in relationships of consonance with or counterpoint to one another -surely demanded a hypertext form. I drew encouragement for my move towards digital forms from Landow's claim that, 'Most poststructuralists write from within the twilight of the wished-for coming day; most writers of hypertext write of many of the same things from within the dawn'. 7 I was particularly influenced in my early exploration of interactive forms of narrative by two works by Umberto Eco: The Open Work, from which I drew a foundational understanding of the hermeneutic relationship, and The Limits of Interpretation, which led me towards more intricate theories of narratology, in both cases for how they might be applied to digital forms. 8 I saw Eco's work as advancing Barthes' reconceptualisation of the relative importance of author and reader in 'making a text happen', by recognising that, 'a text is a lazy machinery which forces its possible readers to do a part of its textual work, but the modalities of the interpretive operations -albeit multiple, and possibly infinite -are by no means indefinite and must be recognised as imposed by the semiotic strategies displayed by the text'. 9 In other ways, he explicitly posed 'the more formidable question of the recognition of the reader's response as a possibility built into the textual strategy'. However, the text Eco envisioned was that of the book (or possibly a film), whose structural complexity, since pre-determined, is 'necessarily finite', while the principle of infinite interpretative variation is a function of 'the artifice of its composition'. 10 As I began to work with hypertext, I quickly realised that insofar as it reified the hermeneutic process, rather than merely structurally mirroring its theorisation, it did so crudely. A user or reader who expresses an interpretive strategy by means of navigating through a network of pages and links, or nodes and edges, may experience a sense of agency. Yet however complex the underlying narrative network, it remains static, uninflected by their response to the text. The reader's experience is that of the flÃ¢neur, at best, though more often of the idle browser who is, necessarily, at least half-blind to the consequences of the choices they make when selecting their route. For where a reader is allowed to preview steps along a possible path, this unavoidably subverts the narrative effects that derive from anticipation and the testing of hypothecations of the consequent narrative logic. The loss of authorial artifice in what has become known as 'ergodic literature' invites certain obvious solutions but these are often inherently problematic.",

      "text": "Espen Aarseth defined 'ergodic' in 1997 according to the criterion that 'nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text', (according to this principle, reading Finnegan's Wake is trivial, while link-clicking on web clickbait is not). 11 A more productive understanding of the nature of the interpretative choices that the reader of such work expresses through their navigation of the text is to be found in Marie-Laure Ryan's claim in 2006 that 'external/exploratory interactivity â€¦ promotes a metafictional stance, at the expense of immersion in the virtual world' of the electronic text. 12 This points towards a particular kind of experience in which the 'reader' may take a more active, constructive role that is critical, detached and strategic but also consequential. However, by assuming 'an external perspective on the worlds of the textual universe' the reader not only loses the experience of immersion, but finds themselves in a paradoxical relationship with narratorial authority. 13 As Ruth Aylett and Sandy Louchart explain, 'On the one hand the author seeks control over the direction of a narrative in order to give it a satisfactory structure. On the other hand a participating user demands the autonomy to act and react without explicit authorial constraint.' 14 Closely related to the challenge of maintaining the immersion of the strategically reflective user in the narrative that they are constructing is the inherent resistance of hypertextual narrative to closure, which Coover had predicted would 'be a major theme for narrative artists of the future'. 15 Far from limiting a reader's interpretive agency, narrative closure is, in fact, a necessary element of any strategy that ensures the openness of the text. Both as a kairotic moment in which the ideal reader's construction of the text is realised and meaning is integrated, and as the point to which her imaginative efforts are directed, it is the keystone of that 'artifice of its composition' which the author has architected. and complex is the initial understanding needed.",

These began with Meantime, my MA graduation project, a screen-based interactive chamber drama, and included Ages of Avatar, for which I explored the dramaturgical use of improvisational scenarios in virtual worlds. 20 The culmination of this phase of my work was the Gnosis story engine that I designed for the German company eMedia, as the foundation for a series of planned console games, of which the first, Extinct, involved a narrative set in early thirteenth-century Magdeburg. No commercial project using Gnosis was completed or released, and my investigation of the subject was poorly documented, in part because of contractual restraints. However, my work predicted much theoretical discussion of interactive narrative that has been published by others in the decade and a half since (to which, where relevant, I defer).",

My design of Gnosis was grounded in the concept of the 'storyworld', which Paul Herman has since summarised as 'the overall fictional ontology described within a narrative text'. 21 Herman further explains that, 'Interpreters of narrative do not merely reconstruct a series of events and a set of existents but imaginatively (emotionally, viscerally) inhabit a world.' 22 The creator of narratives for such emergent interactive forms can be thought of as designing the terms on which the user encounters the storyworld, and the way in which it responds to that encounter.",

With rules set to govern how these entities interacted with one another, according to their individual affordances, an ecological system of autonomous agents was established. The complex behaviour of these agents then generated events that provided material for selection and presentation as a narrative, which could be manifest in a range of styles (textual, graphical, isometric, 2D, etc). The participant's role within the storyworld was equivalent to that of another agent, but one with enhanced capabilities and understanding who could intentionally alter the state of the agent-ecology by influencing elements within it. The participant's primary objective, therefore, was to observe and understand the rules and attributes of the storyworld in order to effect the consequences as they wished, and so shape the narrative that emerged. Within this 'playable story' they needed to learn to 'play the system'.",

To ensure narrative coherence, sustained activity and meaningful closure it was therefore necessary to impose constraints on the ecology.

These points of review and reconfiguration marked, in effect, breaks between episodes or chapters, in which the potential content of the next episode or chapter was determined. For a narrative represented in a three-dimensional virtual environment, such as the console games that the Gnosis engine was designed to control, these episodes or 'levels' would take the form of specific, procedurally generated configurations of space-time within the larger world of the story.",

The particular chronotopic configuration of narrative space-time defines a work's literary genre, and a text is read in relation to the chronotopic expectations it creates.

Paterson saw that 'it takes a real act of imagination to recreate the life that once filled the city's streets' and to present 'an almost Dickensian parade of diverse humanity', while Bettany Hughes thought that we had 'met head on the problem of a sensational, real story whose historical evidence is fragmentary. Rather than falling into the trap of alighting on colourful secondary sources and regurgitating them as historical fact, separate sections are driven by creative prose and by archaeology respectively.' 25 Roger Ling, though, suggested that the book belonged 'to a new category, half fiction, half \"faction\"', intending faint praise, at best. Meanwhile Beard suggested that 'if any reader is lulled â€¦ into thinking that there is much real history in this book, they should beware'. Peter Wiseman contrasted our 'rash conjectures' to the 'sober, judicious â€¦ genuinely authoritative' work of Ling. 26 Might the typographical assertion of an absolute distinction (italic/non-italic) between registers while these registers are, at the same time, intentionally blurred be especially disquieting for scholars whose professional work cannot cross that line?",

      "text": "A review in The Journal of Classics Teaching wrestled with the question from a pedagogical perspective, was excited that the work 'marries historical imagination and fiction in a daring and inventive way' but concerned for the bad habits that students might learn if exposed to its 'embellish[ment of] the facts with fictional passages' while pretending to 'objective truth'. 27 By contrast, Paterson remarked that our 'scrupulous highlighting' of the distinction is a 'slightly spurious and unnecessary practice', since 'the whole book is an example of the disciplined use of imagination, which all historians worth their salt have to employ all the time'. 28 Whilst Pompeii relied substantially on the management of the different textures of writing to signal degrees of evidential reliability, to encourage imaginative and critical insistence that it was a 'true story', which consciously echoed the subtitles of the protonovels of exploration into terra incognita (more legible when the main title was The Map of Utopia), should also have triggered a cognitive dissonance between notions of 'truth' and dreaming, scheming, secrecy, and indeed 'story '. 52 No reviewer remarked on the main title, but the subtitle of the book was regularly misread, as by the Boston Globe's assumption that it was 'a fun title it doesn't deserve', invented by a 'marketing wizard' to disguise an 'exhaustive history of the international anarchist movement'. 53 Others, more generously, thought it 'doesn't begin to round up the sprawling cast of characters' or was 'too modest for the monumental work'. Without my knowledge, the Dutch publisher replaced the subtitle with 'A History of Anarchism', allowing Hans Muys to surmise that this was 'what Alex Butterworth wanted to write', before dismissing the book's actual intentions as a distraction from that task. 54 Nevertheless, several anglophone reviewers, predominantly in the United States, criticised the book for its shortcomings as an encylopedic history of anarchism, seemingly oblivious to the paratextual signalling. Although disappointing, this was, perhaps, inevitable. Anarchism is a central concern for few books written for trade publication, yet not long after TWTNW's publication, 'anarchism' was the second most edited entry on Wikipedia. 55 Frustrated adherents wanted fuller acknowledgement of individuals with whom they were preoccupied, however marginal they were to the imperatives of the book's scope. 56 Wendy Smith, in a review that celebrated the book's actual aims, pointed readers who wanted simply 'a comprehensive history of anarchism' towards Joll's earlier and excellent book The Anarchists. 57 Stuart Christie saw the 'main story' as 'the penetration of these groups of often naÃ¯ve utopians by the sinister functionaries of the secret state'.",

The years after I graduated from the Royal College of Art with a Master's degree in Design for Interactive Multimedia in 1996 were, in retrospect, a golden age of intellectual openness for digital media, when its potential could be discerned, but before the colonisation by commercial forces. 'The first phase of web culture, one must admit, carried a revolutionary impulse; call it the Saint-Just to today's imperial era,' media philosopher Alexander Galloway has written. 'Walls were coming down, hierarchies were crumbling, the old brick and mortar society was giving way to the new digital universe.' 1 However, my own concern was, as it remains, primarily with the design and authoring of discrete, unitary interactive experiences of narrative.",

After graduating in 1992, alongside work as a stage dramatist and studies in screenwriting, I began work on a novel called Merciless. The influence of Michel Foucault and Paul Ricoeur on my writing was strong, as was that of the postmodernist sub-genre of 'historiographical metafiction' that was then in its heyday. Linda Hutcheon has described how works of 'historiographical metafiction' blur the line between objectivity and subjectivity by means of polyphonic accounts and unreliable narration. 3 They elide time to challenge our expectations of historicity and employ In this, I rejected demands such as those by Pierre Machery to dethrone assumptions of harmony and totality 'which imply a theoretical misconception of the literary work'. 16 Rather, I embraced Ricoeur's vision of narrative and emplotment as the universal expression of human 'experiences of temporality'. 17 The challenge I then conceived was to devise a narrative form, or system, that maintained immersion and offered a high frequency of interaction and ensured closure, without compromising its literary or other stylistic qualities.",

Such systems would involve 'calculation in their production of scriptons' -'scriptons' being the finest grain of content whose organisation has been algorithmically determined. It would, in another Aarseth coinage, be a form of 'cybertext'. 18 In simple terms, such an approach might, for example, enable an author to track the aggregated decisions made by a reader along the path taken through a hypertext, relate this aggregate to the reader's accumulated knowledge of the narrative and how it could be interpreted as informing their choices at every point, and dynamically generate or deploy a scripton accordingly. The user would be afforded a persistent sense of both agency and immersion, while subtle effects of irony and narratorial unreliability could also be surfaced, by systemic intervention, in the emergent text. Equally, the reader/user's direct involvement in the process of narrative construction, through frequent and legibly consequential interventions, would implicate them in the psychological or ethical ramifications of their narrative desires or the interpretive decisions.",

Authorial intention is here expressed to and through a machine as well as through human readable text. As Katherine Hayles, a prominent early theorist of electronic literature, observed, 'Language alone is no longer the distinctive characteristic of technologically developed societies; rather, it is language plus code.' 19 To instruct a computer, or indeed a human, how to perform a task entails first understanding in detail how that task is performed. The greater the sophistication and variability of the task, the greater the number of possible combinations and rules governing them, the more detailed interaction between the real and the possible, between the actual or 'protoworld' and the constellation of 'heterocosms' or possible worlds, perceived or projected, around it, each of which constitutes a distinct 'ontological landscape'. 26 As Ryan has written, 'The relations among the worlds of the narrative system [e.g. the \"knowledge-worlds\", or \"obligation-worlds\", or \"fantasy-worlds\" of characters] are not static, but change from state to state.' 27 One might think of this in terms of the character who dreams of a better future and sees the present through the prism of those hopes, or one whose paranoia lends credence to every suspicion, or a narrator so lacking in self-knowledge that their account of reality is unreliable. Implicit in the notion of possible worlds, like that of the Bakhtinian chronotope, is the promise of dialogism: the trace of the movement of different possible worlds in relation to one another constitutes plot; the reader or user's varying perspective on that trace equates to narrative. For Elena Gomel, the theory revolutionises 'the study of narrative by shifting its focus from mimesis to poesis, the creation of independent ontological domains that may or may not correspond to the cultural reality.' 28 This conception of narrative acknowledges the instability of experience and the constructed nature of realist representation, which can vary according to the normative mentalities of the actual world.",

      "text": "The example Pavel offers to illuminate the point is how the 'actual world is different for authors of medieval miracle plays (speaking Holy Virgin) or modern mystery novels (network of drug dealers)'. 29 Such an approach to emergent narrative rests on the idea that the participant or user is involved in a self-reflexive process of exploration and knowledge formation, through a creative dialogue with the systemically invested author. I conceptualised this in terms of the notion of 'choragraphy', proposed by Gregory Ulmer in his theory of heuretics: a logic of invention by means of artistic thought processes, in which constructing a narrative becomes a method of inquiry. 30 The exploration of possible versions and interpretations of the real world itself constitutes the narrative. Accordingly, my conception of the 'story engine' was as a system that controls the generation of a type of interactive narrative of which Ryan would later write, hypothetically, that 'there is no winning or losing: the purpose of the player is not to beat the game, but to observe the evolution of the storyworld'. 31 44 Furet (1985), p.21 45 Synder, Guardian, 20 th May, 2015 46 Lukacs (1983) p.42 47 Ginzburg (1993) p.212 48 Levi (1991) pp.93-4 quoted by Ginzburg (1993) 49 Ginzburg (2012) p.205 50 Ginzburg (2012) p.209 A note to the page observes, in relation to the lacunar nature of all historical evidence that 'new research questions create new lacunae.' 51 Ginzburg (2012) p.204 52 Ginzburg (2012) p.207 53 Hitchcock 'Big Data, Small Data and Meaning.' 54 BÃ¶rner, 'Plug-and-Play Macroscopes', quoted by Hitchcock 55 Hitchcock, op cit. 56 Foucault (1984) Kracauer (1969) p.134 referring to Bloch (1939), cited by Ginzburg (2012) Aarseth (1997) p.62 A 'scripton' may be imagined as a nugget of text that may or may not be dynamically composed, defined here as 'strings [of information] as they appear to the readers in distinction to 'textons' which are strings within the scripted text. 68 White (1987) p.173 69 Ricoeur (1984) p.169 70 White (1987) p.173 71 Dolozel (2010) 72 Lorente (1996) p.2 73 Ryan (1991) p.21 74 Dolozel (2010) p.42 'Historical texts are means of noesis, of knowledge acquisition: they construct historical worlds as models of the actual world. Therefore they are constrained by the requirement of truth valuation.' 75 Bakhtin (1981) Chartier (2011) Klein (2004) p. 13 Klein is concerned with 'structured plot points inside a scripted space, a contrapuntal form of story' and how this is encoded in the historical and contemporary baroque. 'Special effects', for him, introduce the fictive to the real, one country at which Humanity is always landing' but was rejected as too weak by the publisher. This was fortunate since, shortly afterwards, Stoppard's new trilogy of plays dealing with the previous generation of international revolutionaries, including Bakunin, was premiered with the title The Coast of Utopia. However, the idea of mapping and exploring might have more effectively triggered the association of 'true story' with unreliable literary precedents. 51 Its form was meant as a light-hearted response to the unnecessarily extended subtitles with which many non-fiction titles were fashionably overburdened at the time 52 Foley (1986) p.107 Early novelistic fiction, offering titles such as a 'true and genuine history' or a 'life of', asks 'to be read as one kind of discourse but [encourages] perceptual habits and responses routinely associated with another kind of discourse.' 53 The response of Price for the Boston Globe may have been because the planned integration of additional illustrations to point up the motif scheme was reduced, for reasons of cost, to one 'global' image at the beginning and end of the text. 54 Butterworth (2011) Die Wereld, Muys De Morgan (review) 55 Yasseri et al. wrote the paper (2013) on their research into Wikipedia editing 56 eg. Braekman, www.deknack.be 57 Smith Los Angeles Times (review), Joll (1965) 58 Christie Guardian, Kansas City Star, Miller Salon.com (all reviews) 59 Gray, Hughes-Hallett, Miller, Preston op.cit. 60 Jones,Hughes,Paterson,Stevenson,all op cit. and Gardam Spectator (review), among others 61 Miller,op. cit. McKinstry The Express,Kerl International Socialist Review (reviews) 62 Butterworth (2010) p.99-100 Hughes-Hallett op.cit. Bakhtin (1981) p.349 'In Dostoevsky's novels, the life experience of the characters and their discourse may be resolved as far as plot is concerned but internally they remain incomplete and unresolved.' They were novels of ideas in which a polyphony of conflicting views challenged unitary authorial vision. 63 Wiseman Times Literary Supplement (review) 64 Wiseman ibid., Butterworth (2005) p.7 65 Hopkins (2000) pp.44-45 66 Beard, op. cit.. 67 Wiseman op. cit. 68 And yet as Rowbotham's review of TWTNW remarked, the absence online of my own promised endnotes, betrays my own larger intentions. 'Dumping references is like destroying maps and closing public pathways. In a book packed with democrats and featuring, in Reclus and Kropotkin, two radical geographers, this is especially bad news.'
