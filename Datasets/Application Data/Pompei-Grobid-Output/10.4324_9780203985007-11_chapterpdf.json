      "text": "Introduction \"The ancients\", Moses Finley tells us, \"were firm in their view that civilized life was thinkable only in and because of cities.\" To the ancients a city \"must be more than a mere conglomeration of people; there are necessary conditions of architecture and amenity\". 2 The discovery and excavation of the two buried ancient cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii in the 18th century offered, for the first time since antiquity, a glimpse into just those \"conditions of architecture and amenity\" referred to by Finley-that is to say, into the physical structure of the ancient city, 3 with its walls, streets, tombs, public and private buildings. It is all the more surprising therefore that it took half a century after the identification of Pompeii in 1763 (digging had been in progress since 1748), 4 for Pompeii to be published as a city in FranÃ§ois Mazois's (1783-1826) 5 magnificent Les ruines de PompÃ©i, published from 1812 onwards. 6 At Pompeii, wrote the authors of a work claiming 7 to be the first in English to describe the ruins (Sir William Gell and John Gandy's Pompeiana, of 1817-19), \"in the mind of the liberal antiquary the loneliness of the ruins may be animated by learned recollection\". It is a sense of that \"civilized lifeâ€¦thinkable only in and because of cities\", noted by Finley, that Mazois, Gell and Gandy seek to recreate. \"Animation\" of the ruins by \"learned recollection\" is suggested, for instance, by the frontispiece to Pompeiana (Fig. 10.1), \"wholly compiled from paintings and bronzes found at Pompeii\". 8 An image is created through the combination of the artefacts of everyday life, the chairs, the tables, the lamps, the paintings, the marbles, with \"pavements and distant buildings\". 9 Images from different sources are composed, rather in the manner of 20th century collage, to create a new composite image. The second volume of Mazois's work, Habitations (published in 1824), has a similarly composed frontispiece (Fig. 10.2):",

The Pilasters and the capitals belong to house no.27, [10] the entablature and the stucco which decorate it, the paintings which ornament the interior frieze, the portico at the end and several other details are taken from various buildings. The fountain can be seen in house no.46, called L'ActÃ©on; [11] the motif of the garden which completes the tableau was given to me by a painting existing in the same place; the two herms are kept at the MusÃ©e des Ã‰tudes at Naples; in short all the elements of this composition are antique, and the arrangement in which I offer them gives an exact view of the entry into one of the principal houses of Pompeii. 12 The tradition of compositions and vignettes drawn from the elements of Pompeii continued. In 1851, for instance, Jules Bouchet (1799-1860) published a book of such Compositions antiques freely modelled on Pompeii. It is the making, the transmission, and the absorption of such images of ancient city life into the modern world that is the subject of this essay. These images combine, on the one hand, \"the figure reading a volume, the chair upon which she sits, the footstoolâ€¦manuscripts at her feetâ€¦marble table\", 13 with, on the other hand, Pausanius' \"government offices, â€¦gymnasium, â€¦market-place, â€¦water descending to a fountain\" 14 -linking the world of the individual with that of the community, the microcosm represented by the house with the macrocosm represented by the city. 15 Vitruvius \"To the ancients\", writes Moses Finley, \"the urban underpinning of civilization\" 16 was self-evident. When one turns to the only ancient exposition of the discipline of architecture that has survived, Vitruvius' De architectura, it is indeed the idea of the building of a city that underpins the structure of the book. For Vitruvius the art of building is the art of building the city-his exposition proceeds from the choice of site (1.4), to the building of the city walls (1.5), to the laying out of the broad streets and the alleys (1.6.1), and continues with the division into building plots:",

After this [my emphasis] men began to considerâ€¦shelter from the sun and rain.

The aim of the Quattro libri is, Palladio tells us: to publish the designs of those [ancient] edifices, (in collecting which, I have employed so much time, and exposed myself to so many dangers)â€¦ andâ€¦those rules which I have observedâ€¦that they who shall read these my books, may be able to make use of whatever may be good thereinâ€¦, 23 When, as he must in a complete presentation of architecture through the context of the city, Palladio turns (in book II) to the description and illustration of building for individuals, the town houses and country villas, he tells us: as we have but very few examples from the ancients, of which we can make use, I shall insert the plans and elevations of many fabrics I have erectedâ€¦[as well as] the designs of ancient houses, in the manner that Vitruvius shews us they were made. 24 At this critical point in his book, then, Palladio has no ancient houses to illustrate. Instead he must fall back, first, on his attempts to reconstruct, from Vitruvius' written description, what an ancient house might have looked like, then presenting images of houses that he himself had built. It is perhaps not surprising that there is a resemblance between Palladio's version of the ancient house and contemporary work. Vitruvius' ancient house is reconstructed in the classicizing language of Palladio's own practice; past and present are elided in a passion to represent the ancient city.

It is to replace partial with complete publication: Les monuments de PompÃ©i ne sont encore connus que par l'ouvrage de l'AcadÃ©mie de Naples sur les mosaÃ¯ques et les peinturesâ€¦aussi les savants, les artistes, les amateurs, attendent-ils avec impatience, depuis prÃ¨s de cinquante ans, un ouvrage exact et complet sur les antiquites de cette villeâ€¦. 31 Les plans sont tout rÃ©duits sur une mÃªme Ã©chelle, ainsi que les elevations et les coupesâ€¦en un mot j'ai cherchÃ© a ne rien omettre de ce qui peut aider a expliquer clairment chacun des edifices, et servir a les comparer entre eux. 32 And as we have seen (above, p. 186) Mazois is aware, too, of the importance of Pompeii in transforming knowledge of the ancient house (and hence of the fabric of the city). He placed his study of the ruins of Pompeii in the context of thoughts about the relation of the discipline of architecture to the city and to the house, a context that links Vitruvius, Alberti, and Palladio. The manner of Mazois's presentation makes these connections clear; the first volume describes the walls, the gates, the roads that lead to them (and the tombs that line them); the second volume, the houses; the third volume, secular public buildings; the fourth, temples (and theatres). The city is presented to us in a Vitruvian sequence; Mazois's division into volumes closely parallels that of Palladio's Quattro Libri (book II, houses; book III, fora and basilicas; book IV, temples). Mazois, like Vitruvius, describes the ancient city through the whole range of its elements, from the walls and streets (Fig. 10.3) to the buildings, both public and private, and then, like Vitruvius, to detail of painted decoration (Fig. 10.4):",

Les parois du mur, qui entoure de deux cÃ´tÃ©s ce dÃ©licieux rÃ©duit, sont peintes avec une goÃ»t exquisâ€¦la decorationâ€¦rapelle cette piece de la maison de Pline en Toscane: \"ou l'on voyait des oiseaux perchÃ©s sur des ramaux verdoyants et au-dessous une petite fontaine dont l'eau tombait dans un bassin avec un agrÃ©able 'murmur'.\" 34 The same attention to the indissoluble effect of architecture and decoration is evident when Mazois describes the peristyle of the house with the rooms that surround it. The group must, he says, be, \"un appartement secret, consacrÃ© au plaisir et a l'amour\" 35 with its: Cabinets: dans l'un d'eux existe encore une peinture qui indique assez la destination de ces boudoirs; on y voit Mars enchaÃ®nÃ© dans les bras de VÃ©nus, tandis que l'amour joue en riant avec les armes terribles du dieu de combats. [36] â€¦ Cette decoration est d'un goÃ»t dÃ©licieux; les ornements Ã´tent au fond noir, ce qu'a de trop lugubre cette colour dont on fit choix, sans doute, a fin de donner plus d'Ã©clat au tient et aux vÃªtements des femmes admises dans ce volupteux sÃ©jourâ€¦ Le tableau au fond de la cour reprÃ©senteâ€¦ ActÃ©on dÃ©couvrant Diane au bain, etâ€¦le mÃªme personage dÃ©vorÃ© par ses chiens.

The remainder of the century saw a continuous stream of studies and reconstructions from the students of the Villa Medici 38 -but none of this work, though, goes beyond Mazois in conception. Perhaps inevitably, due to the particular requirements of the Envois, 39 the concentration was on the details of the orders, painted decoration, or monumental groups of buildings, such as the forum 40 or the theatre district, 41 but not with the city as a whole. Not until the turn of the century did pensionnaires concern themselves with the study of a complete 42 town with, most notably, Tony Garnier's study of Tusculum of 1903 and Jean Hulot's reconstruction of Selinus of 1904-1906. 43 Of prime importance for the 20th century is the work of Tony Garnier.",

      "text": "Tony Garnier (1869-1948) seems to us now to stand between two worlds-the world of the great French academic system of architectural teaching and practice, represented by the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Villa Medici in Rome-and the world of the beginning of what we now call Modern architecture. Garnier's time as pensionnaire at the Villa Medici, between 1900 and 1904, precisely marks this transition. 44 In the first year of his tenure, in addition to the required (but according to the academy, inadequate) 45 study of an ancient monument (in his case the Tabularium) Garnier submitted drawings of an Industrial City invented for a site near Lyons (\"a daub of pencil marks\", reported the academy). 46 Garnier's final envoi, too, was an urban study-a restoration of the town of Tusculum (which for Garnier had the advantage of very few remains to constrain him). 47 That restoration (Fig. 10.6) clearly borrowed from Pompeii, where Garnier's fellow pensionnaire, Chifflot, had made restoration drawings of the House of the Centenary in the previous year. 48 Following his return to his home town of Lyons in 1904, a further enlarged and revised version of the CitÃ© industrielle reached publication in 1917, 50 this publication now being augmented by built work carried out in Lyons, presented uniformly as if part of the development of the earlier proposals. The house and studio, of 1909-10, that Garnier had built for himself at SaintRambert, is included in the plates (Fig. 10.8), 51 a house that, without columns or classical detail, is an abstraction of a Pompeian house. Garnier's atelier is as symmetrically related to its atrium as, say, the tablinum of the House of the Faun to its atrium and peristyle, and the house is photographed (plates 121 and 122 of Une citÃ© industrielle) with all the attention to ways in which a sense of light and greenery suffuses from atrium and garden that so delighted Mazois at the House of Sallust. A half-size nude statue of Madame Garnier facing the atrium seems to play the same rÃ´le in suggesting the intimacy of domestic life as does the painting of Mars and Venus in Mazois's description of the peristyle at the House of Sallust (p. 189 above). In the 1917 publication, the industrial and public elements, too, are supplemented by examples from Garnier's practice in Lyon; but the real point here is not the separate elements, but that all elements are presented together as part of a total organization-the visual equivalent of a social organization-and there is indeed a social as well as a cultural programme in the work. Garnier proposes the inscription of passages from Zola's Travail on the walls of his \"Chamber of Assemblies\" (Travail was first published Garnier was searching for a topic for his work at the Villa Medici). 52 Anthony Vidler has discussed this social programme in the catalogue of the 1990 exhibition of Garnier's work at the Centre Pompidou 53 but my concern here is to note that Garnier presents the city as an organic whole, a collective work of art-proceeding, in a way reminiscent of Vitruvius, from the establishment of the settlement on its site, to the various types of public buildings: the assembly halls, the sports buildings, the schools, the factories, each finding a place within a structure articulated by streets and alleys, with individual houses, like Garnier's own, offering at once a retreat from, and by analogy, a connection with, the organism as a whole.",

      "text": "Garnier's work was widely transmitted to the architectural world through the most influential architectural text of the 20th century, Le Corbusier's Vers une architecture of 1923, which presented, with approving comments, plans and perspectives of the housing areas of the CitÃ©. 55 Le Corbusier had met Tony Garnier in Lyons in 1907 and tells us: He had won the \"Grand Prix d'Architecture\" and it was from Rome that he sent his project the \"ville industrielle\". This man discerned the approach of a new architecture based on social phenomena. His plans show great sophistication. They stand at the end of a hundred years of architectural evolution in France. 56 Four years after that meeting, Le Corbusier was himself in Pompeii, 57 and responding in a way that is close to the abstracted interpretation of the atrium house that Garnier created at Saint-Rambert. Le Corbusier describes his experience of the House of the Silver Wedding thus: And then you are in the atrium; four columns (four cylinders) shoot upwards towards the shade of the roofâ€¦but at the far end is the brilliance of the garden seen through the peristyle which spreads out this light with a large gesture, distributes it and accentuates it, stretching widely from left to rightâ€¦ Our elements are wallsâ€¦. The walls are in full brilliant light or in half shade or in full shadowâ€¦your symphony is madeâ€¦. Have respect for walls. The Pompeian did not cut up his wallspaces. He was devoted to wall spaces and loved lightâ€¦ The impression of light is extended outside by cylinders (I hardly like to say columns, a worn out word) 58 Designed by Le Corbusier, and incorporating his own version of a CitÃ© industrielle, the pavilion itself was in the form of a prototypical apartment dwelling, arranged round a hanging garden. Within the pavilion is presented a diorama of the city, of which the apartment blocks-Le Corbusier called them immeubles-villas (Fig. 10.11)-were the elements, the insulae, of the city. As well as this presentation at the city scale were shown the paintings, rugs, furniture and equipment conforming to that new spirit, l'esprit nouveau, which Le Corbusier and his collaborators were exploring and promoting through their magazine-the final issue of which served as a catalogue for the pavillion. 60 \"We were not concerned with frivolities,\" wrote Le Corbusier; \"we went from the everyday object to the urbanisation of great cities-an enormous undertaking.\" 61 Within the pavilion, arranged around the atrium-like jardin suspendu, as in a Pompeian house, or Garnier's studio at Saint-Rambert, the visitor's mind was focused on the one hand, by means of the diorama, to the scale of the city of which the pavilion was a microcosm, and on the other to the scale of the objects of everyday life-most particularly to works of painting and sculpture (Fig. 10.12): Painting: We have placed on the wall-paintings of Picasso, Braque, LÃ©ger, Gris, Ozenfant, Jeanneret, and arranged sculptures by Lipchitz; easel paintings in frames and free standing sculpture, independent of the wall. We are not, at the moment, partisans of fresco paintingâ€¦ It is better that painting or sculpture is not made to order but is a direct product of the imagination. We want to create an architectural terrain made from matter, from light, and from proportion, in which works with high emotional potential are at ease. We detach painting and sculpture from the wall so that they are free to act with the charge that they contain. 62 These \"purist\" paintings (as their authors christened them) presented an imaginative reflection of images of everyday and industrial life, surely the equivalent in the Pompeian house of paintings of \"poultry, eggs, vegetables, fruit\", 63 \"the battles of Troy and the wanderings of Ulysses over the countryside\", or \"Mars locked in the arms of Venus\". This equivalence is not, of course, to be taken as an exact one; in what is for Le Corbusier a characteristic strategy of disengagement, or articulation, of elements, the wall and its modulation of light 64 are separated from the figuration of representational painting. The continuum between the macrocosm of the city and the microcosm of the dwelling (and the imaginative world re-created through its decoration), so powerfully presented by Mazois, has been taken apart and reassembled. The desire for that continuum, though, remains. In the introduction to his Aspects of antiquity Moses Finley cites John Jones, in turn citing Fustel de Coulanges: \"Rien dans les temps moderne ne leur [GrÃ©ce et Rome] ressemble. Riens dans l'avenir ne pourra leur ressembler\". 65 The responses, in the modern world, to the ruins of Pompeii that I have discussed may show resemblances to the ancient city but, to echo Mazois's comment on Palladio's atria, each \"must be regarded in some way as a new invention\". One might say that it is when most thoroughly and critically transformed, in the work of a Le Corbusier or a Garnier, that responses to the ancient city have had most resonance. The Nachleben of the ancient world does not flow simply as a stream.",
