      "text": "The depth of the ruins and their wonderful preservation suggested that rather than expose them, as at Rome, they should follow the example of the Herculaneum excavations, using shafts and tunnels to mine the ruins, a method used three decades before by the prince d'Elboeuf, 4 and more recently by the Spanish military engineer Roque de Alcubierre. 5 NiccolÃ² Marcello Venuti, the librarian of the King and a fine antiquarian, argued for exposure of the ruins, at Herculaneum as well: \"I would have wished -he reminded his friend Anton Francesco Gori in April 1748 -that all that beautiful Theater could be excavated in apricum [in the open air]...; I also craved for digging to start from the seaside, but I had no such authority to work in my way. \" Only an open air excavation would give the actual view of the ancient city re-emerging (fig. 1), the feature that was the most fascinating for many scholars. Thus, among the first to visit the excavations, in 1739, the French President Charles de Brosses wrote to the great naturalist Leclerc de Buffon: 6 \"there is nothing in the world more singular, than to have found an entire city under the earth.\" Even more visionary was Scipione Maffei in 1747, when he wrote: \"O what a great fortune of our times it is that there was discovered not one or another single ancient monument, but a whole city! [...] It would be desirable above all, that they decide to work from above, lifting, and carrying away that mountain of ash [...] An enormous undertaking indeed, but a little one for a powerful king and provided with heroic spirit as he is [...] in this way, we will revive the dead city, which, after a thousand and seven hundred years, will see the sun again [...] To the greatest benefit of the country, all the men of learning of Europe will flock to Naples [...] Proceeding in blind and narrow tunnels, much will be inevitably spoiled and destroyed, neither will you ever see a noble building in its entirety nor its elevations, nor you will know how and where the many statues, and the other ornaments were situated [...] It will be also inevitable to cut many objects into pieces, in order to remove them from their places and carry them away. So much has happened to many painted walls [...]. On the contrary, clearing and leaving everything in its place, the whole city would be an incomparable Museum.\" 7 In 1750 Maffei applied the same ideas to Pompeii, saying to one of is Neapolitan guests, that \"if these discoveries, really rare and amazing as they are, were not covered again, [even] in his already decrepit and dilapidated age, he would put himself in a litter to have the pleasure, before dying, of seeing these miraculous remains, uncorrupted, and authentic, of noble antiquity.\"",

      "text": "But most of the antiquarians, Italians and foreigners, supported the opposite option, considering the huge mass of volcanic material that should have to be removed, the presence of the modern town of Resina above the ancient city, elements that made any open air excavation too expensive. So Gabriel Richard (1748) stated: \"only an extreme love for antiquity could inspire a similar idea... \" 8 and Winckelmann himself thought that the idea was quite silly, writing to the Count of Bruhl \"but about the unveiling of the entire city, I would invite those who wish for this to reflect, that since the houses were crushed by the enormous weight of the lava, you would not see anything but the ruined walls ... and what advantage? What to see old ruined walls ... just to satisfy the ill-timed curiosity of few\". 9 Thus the decision was made to continue mining Herculaneum through tunnels (fig. 2) that now followed, now pierced the walls, looking for paintings, statues and other ornaments to be exhibited in the new Museum Herculanense that the King had established in his new Royal Palace on the seaside of Portici. 10 This method aimed at the excavation of objects to collect, without too much regard for the structures from which they were extracted; and as was traditional in all the excavations for antiquities since the Renaissance, this was also applied in the first phase to the excavations of Pompeii, which started, as we known, in 1748. 11 Here on the hill of the \"Civita\" the situation was more favorable than at Herculaneum, with open countryside rather than modern settlements above it, and with the ruins buried by a much thinner and finer volcanic materials. Thus the excavations were much easier and it was possible to carry out an open-air excavation, even though the cost of expropriating the land was still a consideration. To avoid this cost for a few years the diggers proceeded in the usual way, renting only the areas they intended to explore for the time of the excavations. After recovering the ancient objects and emptying the buildings of whatever was considered interesting, the ruins were reburied and the land returned to the owners. From the 23rd of March 1748 onward this happened in the Amphitheater, in the so-called Villa of Cicero, in the house of Julia Felix, 12 in shop V.1.32. Excavators jhopped around from site to site, without any clear strategy, in search of possible precious artifacts. Apart from some objects of great value, such as the mosaic emblemata by Dioskourides or the painted figurines of dancing Maenads and Satyrs that thrilled Winckelmann (who described them as \"light as Thought and beautiful as if from the hands of Graces\"-flÃ¼chtig wie ein Gedanke, und schÃ¶n, wie von der Hand der Gratien), 13 in these early years Pompeii repaid the investment with few works of art comparable to the extraordinary wealth of sculptures and paintings discovered in Herculaneum, 14 and this disappointment led the excavators to stop the undertaking after two years. The break lasted a good five years, during which digging moved, in search of a better luck, to Gragnano and the villas of Stabiae, equally despoiled and reburied, while diggers continuing to rummage through Herculaneum in underground tunnels.",

      "text": "Finally the decision was made -and this time definitively -to go back to Pompeii, starting in 1754 at the Herculaneum Gate, and encouraged by the discovery (1763) of the first inscription that explicitly confirmed that the city they were digging was really the famous Pompeii cited by the texts. From 1763 onwards the excavators finally began to leave the excavated buildings uncovered. The same method of excavation was meanwhile improved, thanks to the contribution of new technicians who had joined the Spanish military engineers, as the French Pierre Bardet 15 and the Swiss Karl Weber, praised by Winckelmann for his \"clever principles.\" 16 A debate between Weber and the restorer Paderni is a good example of the different points of view of those who aimed to detect and study the ancient buildings and those who still cared only for the artifacts. 17 So Paderni writes in 1761: \"[Weber] is stubborn in mappingâ€¦ [Herculaneum], Pompeii and Stabiae, claiming through his Swiss reasons these maps to be more necessary and to have more relevance than any monuments or artifacts that you could find... \" 18 The opposition between the two points of view was stark, all the more so in that now, left in sight and stripped of their decorations and their furnishings, the ancient structures of Pompeii appeared just as ordinary masonry, 19 covered with painted plaster which soon discoloured, so far from that idea of the \"incomparable Museum\" that Maffei had envisioned. And their excavation was a task so different from \"the glorious restoration\" of the ancient monuments that in 1751 Pancrazi had celebrated in the frontispiece of his \"Antiquities of Sicily\" and as one of the special virtues of King Charles, 20 not by chance portrayed with the digging tools at his feet on the \"Prodromi\" of the \"AntichitÃ di Ercolano\". In contrast to the structures, the artifacts extracted from the excavations and entrusted to the Museum restorers exercised a safe and durable fascination. The restoration technique of the paintings had become impeccable: the paintings were cut and mounted on slate supports, according to the method of detachment widely practiced in Rome, where most recently, in 1721, Francis 12.

The history of these excavations has been reconstructed by Del CarMen alonSo -. luzÃ²n 2015. 15. zevi 1980: 61. 16. ParSlow 1991. 17. Strazzullo 1982; De voS 1991. 18. Fonti documentarie, 1979: 88. In a letter on 12 August 1760 Tanucci wrote to the King Charles III that Paderni disagreed with Weber saying that the latter kept busy the workers to draw his imaginary plans and hindered to get the desired fruit from the excavations \"Veber discorda da Paderni, e questo dice, che il gusto di Veber in far piante immaginarie occupa la gente e impedisce il frutto dell 'escavazioni\" (De voS 1991: 111, note 15). Nevertheless we should remember that in 1740 it had been just Paderni to request that the situation of the excavated sites \"la situazione dei luoghi\" be carefully surveyed (De voS 1991: 104). 19. The judgment on the Pompeian architecture had soon become severe; particularly it was compared with the monuments of Rome. Thus Goethe in his diary on 11 March 1787 complained that the houses of Pompeii looked more like maquettes and dolls houses than to real buildings \"mehr Modell und Puppenschrank als GebÃ¤udeÂ». And Charles A. Amaury-Duval would observe in 1829 that \"in Pompeii, everything is nice, but nothing is beautiful; there are often some taste, grace, never grandeur or majesty... others are amazed by the pleasantness, the decor, the comfort of every house, by the beauty and the splendor of the paintings after 17 centuries, by the solidity of the construction, and especially by their elegance in a city which is yet so small. They are full of enthusiastic admiration, and find that the most modest work of the ancients is, in comparison, a reason for us to blush and to recognize our inferiority. I would be tempted to side with these last ones\" (arChitetti franCeSi 1981: 87, 89, transl. Author). 20. zevi i 1988: 13; allroGGen-BeDel 1991. I Farnese had the frescoes from the Domus Transitoria on the Palatine hill detached. The most brilliant example of this technique in Pompeii was the detachment in 1755, carried out by Joseph Canart, 21 of the entire wall of the tablinum from the praedia of Julia Felix (fig. 3), an exploit then repeated at a distance of about a century, with the detachment of the whole mosaic of Alexander in the House of the Faun. 22 The problem of the protection of the painted surfaces was also quickly resolved with the adoption in 1750 of a varnish invented by the Special Artillery Commissioner Stefano Mariconi, 23 based on a mixture of beeswax in an alcohol solution that has proved so far to be effective in keeping intact the colors of the vast majority of detached frescoes. 24 But the true problem was the number. Just as it would be impossible for the few available restorers to cope with the restoration of the mass of materials that were taken in the excavations -to the point that it was even decided to melt the \"useless\" fragments of bronze objects 25 -so even more unthinkable seemed the conservation of the most part, in quantitative terms, of painted plasters and floors left in situ. Rather, the fear that by bribing some guards or workers some collectors could get hold of some fragment of ancient painting left in situ led to the decision (20 April, 1761) to destroy with picks \"useless ancient colored plasters\", i.e. the paintings not reputed 25. The scandalous event was the treatment of the quadriga found in the theater of Herculaneum. Its metal -according the Winckelmann's accusation in his letter to the Earl of BrÃ¼hl -had been used for casting, in addition to two big portraits of the King and of the Queen, the famous \"Mazzocchi\" Horse, that was in the truth a patchwork of pieces from many different statues and painted gypsum. The defense on behalf of the members of the Royal Herculaneum Academy was written by Ferdinando Galiani and by the Director of the Royal Museum of Capodimonte, Mattia Zarrillo: Giudizio dell'abate Winckelmann intorno alle scoperte di Ercolano contenuto in una lettera ad un amico, libretto anonimo stesa da F. Galiani e M. Zarrilli, Napoli 1765. worthy of the royal collections. We must nevertheless remember that in the face of the wave of criticism that such barbarity raised, this order was soon revoked by the royal edict of 12 November 1763. 26 But in general they were satisfied just to patch up the walls to avoid their collapse, to restore the wooden lintels in the rooms to support the overlaying masonry, to fix the plaster with metal clamps, at most, to cover the top of the walls, straightened by horizontal cuts, with sloping tiles to prevent the rain infiltration. These proceedings proved completely insufficient for paintings left in place, and their rapid degradation troubled the visitors accustomed to appreciate their shining colors as soon as they emerged from the soil. In 1782 the Swedish Admiral and Earl Carl August EhrensvÃ¤rd writing to his friend Louis Masreliez after a visit in Pompeii recalled having seen the \"terrible spectacle\" of the pavements in mosaic and of the wall paintings destroyed by the frost. 27 A few years later, in 1786, the Polish Prince Stanislaus Poniatowski, nephew of the last Polish King Stanislaus II, noted: \"I found --that the paintings of this lovely building [the Temple of Isis], as well as all the others, had suffered since 1765 when I was here, in such a manner that they are almost unrecognizable. The scant care they have for the maintenance of these buildings makes it possibly a good thing for the Arts that excavations are so slow and that many buildings that were brought to light have been reburied.\" 28 An early example of a temporary shelter is a wooden structure with a thatched roof (the so called \"lupinati\" quoted by the reports of the Soprastanti), 29 erected on the temple of Isis and known from a Desprez's drawing 30 and a Philipp Hackert painting (fig. 4), 31 but these were a kind of protection not only rarely adopted, but also absolutely unstable and 26. zevi 1980: 58. 27. olauSSon 2015: 56 and note 9. 28. BilinSKi 1982. 29. From 1765 the Minister Tanucci ordered La Vega to provide some protection to the paintings \"which should remain in the temple of Isis\". And La Vega answered that he would \"build for the paintings in the portico a shelter of the same kind that I believe should be done for the temple, but with a lighter wooden structure and with a cover of straw instead of brick tiles, as it is usual for the huts\" (\"un coperto.. della stessa forma che stimo doversi fare il tetto, solo con la differenza di farlo di legno piÃ¹ leggiero e di mettervi invece di tegole delle stoppie, come si sogliono fare le capanne\": Strazzullo 1982 B: 266-267. The pictures of Desprez and Hackert show that finally also the shelter on the temple remained covered by straw. 30. louiS-Jean DeSPrez, Isis Temple in Pompeii, Nationalmuseum Stockholm, in PoMPei e l'euroPa 1748-1943:18 and 67, Cat.

      "text": "In the end, from the very beginning, the Bourbon excavators had resigned themselves, even without explicitly saying so, to the slow, inevitable loss of the decorations left in place, believing that the only possible protection, the one that would ensure the perpetual preservation of what was dug, was graphic documentation and subsequent publication in the \"AntichitÃ di Ercolano\". The care for this activity was absolute, with accurate survey and measurements, carried out by skilled draftsman before the detachment of the selected panels (e.g., in the temple of Isis (fig. 5)), a quality of documentation that still made it possible to reconstruct in a model the original state of the decoration about two and a half a century after the excavations. 32 There was, however, a basic reason for this resignation, namely the endemic shortage of financial resources. The cost of the excavations in fact fell, like that of all the other Royal Sites, on the budget of the Royal Household, as the King was the private owner both of the excavations and of the museum. Despite the regime of absolute monarchy, it was impossible for the King to spend much more even though it exposed him to sometimes fierce criticism from his guests, as happened during the visit of the Archduke and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II of Austria to his brother-in-love, the King of Naples Ferdinand IV. The two sovereigns visited Pompeii on April 6 th , 1769 accompanied by the Queen Maria Carolina, the Austrian Ambassador Count Kaunitz, the English Ambassador William Hamilton, 33 and provided of the learned guide of the antiquarian-adventurer Pierre d'Hancarville. \"Their Majesties came in the first place to the Quarter [the so-called Gladiators Barracks, the porticus post scaenam behind the Theater NdT], and they wanted to examine all its parts with attention [ ...] The Austrian Sovereign observed with pleasure the building, but regretted that they had not also removed the 32.

From this place their Majesties went to the West in a house where ... as by a previous order of H.E. the Marquis Tanucci the number of workmen had been increased a few days since,... they watched with pleasure the digging, and after a short time a bronze vase emerged [and many others things]. [The Emperor] congratulated the King for having made this day such a good hunt... then he asked La Vega how many workmen were employed in that work, and having learned that they were 30, he said to the King, how he could allow that such a work go so feebly. And when he was answered that little by little everything would be done, the Emperor added, that there was not in Europe, in Asia, in Africa and in America a similar thing, and that this was a very special honor to the Kingdom; then he asked the King about who was in charge of these antiquities, and he was told it was the Marquis Tanucci. Her Majesty the Queen showed the same displeasure, and together they urged the King to put more labour into this work ...\" 34 This was not a job for 30 workers, but \"a work to employ three thousand men\": such was the severe final judgment of the young Archduke. Some years afterwards the King of Sweden, Gustav III, visiting Pompeii on 12 February 1784, was also disappointed by the slowness of the excavations. 35 The idea of digging the whole of the city quickly was not only held by Emperors and Kings but was also shared by many travelers, like the Englishman John Moore (in Naples in 1770-75), who criticized the Bourbon court for their lack of strategy, \"they dig only to chase treasures. If the attention of the King was less sensitive to precious artifacts, the city [Pompeii] would be now completely unearthed. The beggars of Naples could accomplish the work in a year's time\". 36 . This criticism about the slowness of the excavations did not take into account either the foreseeable impossibility of conserving the city, especially if excavated in such hurry, or the poverty of the Kingdom (beyond the misleading opulence of the Royal palaces like Caserta or Capodimonte). The Prime Minister, Marquis Tanucci, while appreciating antiquity as a well educated man, was fully aware of the limited resources in Naples. So when the Ambassador of Naples in Paris Ferdinando Galiani informed him of the French criticism of the slow pace of the publications of the antiquities discovered, he replied: \"... we [Neapolitans are poor, and we can't follow in their footsteps a rich Nation (the French) until we bleed ourselves dry [just to satisfy their wish for more copies of the Antiquities].\" 37 For the same economic reasons it was decided to employ children in the excavations alongside adult workers and Tunisian slaves: on October 29, 1763, in view of the excavation of the Herculaneum Gate, the order was given \"to choose, in addition to the workers of the excavation of Pompeii, fifteen children paid one carlino a day.\" Soon they would be joined by women, to the delight of the picturesque sensibilities of foreign painters. But even the workers' wages were miserable: on March 10, 1764 \"Master Antonio Scognamiglio, his children, and all the workers of Pompeii, complain that they are, in Torre Annunziata, in dire need from hunger, as they cannot have bread, rarely paying four grana the eight-ounce piece...\" Despite these difficulties, however, the excavations were no longer just a King's whim. The antiquities around Vesuvius had become an obligatory stop on the Grand Tourparticularly since the Museum of Portici was picked out by such famous travelers as Goethe in his \"Journey in Italy\" (he was in Naples in 1787) as \"the alpha and omega of all collections of antiquities\" 38 and Vesuvius started to be studied by amateur scientists like William Hamilton or depicted by specialized painters such as Pierre Volaire, . This indisputable international prestige was not accompanied, however, by a real consensus of Neapolitan society, not only of the largely illiterate populace, but also of those same educated and enlightened people who hoped for deep reforms capable of raising the Southern population from misery and who saw in the archaeological excavations a strategy of the Court to deter foreign visitors from understanding the most urgent problems of the Kingdom 39 . Thus Ferdinando Galiani wrote in a letter to the physician Antonio Cocchi \"The ultramontane 34. fiorelli 1860-64, under the date. 35. olauSSon 2015: 56 reports a passage of the letter of the King to the Earl G.

Apart from the rushed excavations carried out by General Championnet at the time of the ephemeral Neapolitan Republic in 1799 41 , the second Herculaneum Academy (1787) tried to rationalize the excavation work with powerful earthworks to complete the large buildings left half -filled, such as the Theater (1792-93) or the Odeion (1793-1795) and they went so far as to experiment with explosives in areas free from structures in order to dig faster. 42 At the request of the new King Joseph Bonaparte, the Chief Superintendent of the Royal Museum and of the excavations of the Kingdom, Michele Arditi, 43 prepared a new plan of Pompeii with a large project of expropriation and a resumption of excavations on the via Consulares and the Street of tombs. To remove the earth from the excavations, they decided to use, instead of wheelbarrows, whose maintenance was expensive, a chain of buckets operated by children, 44 who, in addition to their low cost, in this way would be removed from idleness and could harden \"their limbs to fatigue to gradually become useful farmers for the countryside, and able to defend the fatherland\". But once again, the funds allocated were not sufficient to the project: \"the work continues -states a record on February 10, 1808 -but the workers are missing, unable to exist without weekly wages, nor do I have the courage to force them.\" At the end of the reign of Joseph Bonaparte (1808), only the houses of Sallustius, of Apollo and that of Baker had been dug.",

As Charles de Clarac, the painter who tutored the king's sons, wrote in 1813: \"... it is very interesting to know the perimeter [of the city]; on the other hand it will be a great advantage in order to speed the excavations.\" 47 Such an undertaking required a systematic approach. Thus Arditi declared the urgency of an inventory of the site: \"... we could not expect to find in Pompeia things really very precious as artistic masterpieces; the most substantial point is to bring to light all the perimeter of the city and to know exactly its dimension [...] it will be fine to give a name to each city district, to the streets and to the houses and to give a number to these [...] ; it 46. fiorelli 1860-1864, at the date 3 October 1809.

Beside the scientific studies, more immediate measures for the preservation of the structures were also taken. Thus Minister Zurlo, concerned about the conservation of the excavations of Pompeii and the consistent abuse in the restorations of extensions and additions that threatened to obscure the ancient parts, created in 1813 a Commission consisting of three archaeologists (Michele Arditi, Carlo Maria Rosini and Francesco Maria Avellino) and three architects (Francesco Carelli, Francesco Maresca and Raffaele Minervini). The Commission drew up a Rule 51 that paid particular attention to the preservation both of \"any piece of ancient plaster\" by copper clamps and edge strips of modern mortar, and even of bare walls, that, should it be necessary, could also be covered with new plaster.",

Quest'operazione Ã¨ precisamente necessaria per gli intonachi dipinti, che fanno la maggiore bellezza della distrutta Pompei. 2.

We desire that any piece of ancient plaster found be jealously conserved, and if it is not deemed sufficient to surround it with new plaster, we suggest the use of the copper clamps invented by Carlo Maratta, instead of the iron ones subject to a rapid decomposition, which have so far been used in Pompeii. This operation is specifically required for the painted plaster, which forms the greatest beauty of the destroyed city of Pompeii. 2. New plaster, with which to surround the ancient one, should be made up with excellent lime, and sand, and in the case of excellent works of art, even with marble powder, so that it becomes perfectly solid and can inhibit rainfall from penetrating the ancient plaster. 3. We prescribe all the possible economy in covering the ancient old walls with new plaster. The Commission recognized the need for walls which are badly eroded, and in opus incertum, and for these suggests leaving some areas uncovered, through which it would be possible to recognize the type of construction of the ancient wall and to have a clear evidence to distinguish it. For the wall in brick and in opus reticulatum, and others that are perfectly noble, the Commission thinks it best not to cover them. 4. In order to have a perpetual distinction between the ancient and the restored part, the Commission proposes that a line of permanent color, meandering or straight according to the way of the restoration, should be imprinted forever... and that on the face of the restored area should be put a label in vulgar Italian with the indication of the month and the year preceded by the word (whole or half) RESTAURO. 5. We prescribe that as a general rule all plasters be executed with good lime and excellent sand so to avoid the inconvenience that in a short time the new ruins be confused, and imitate the ancient ones.

In his turn, in his \"Voyage Ã Costantinople, en Italie et aux Ã®les de l'Archipel\" (Paris 1798) Chateaubriand had imagined 56 \"leaving the things in the sites where and how they had been found, reconstruct roofs, ceilings, floors and windows to prevent the degradation of paintings and walls, all this within a general plan to make a great Pompeian \"Museum of the Domestic History of the Roman People\". This idea was now gradually returning into vogue now that the Northern tourists, especially the British, were returning in large numbers to Pompeii, 57 provided with excellent new guidebooks such as the W. Gell's Pompeiana, 58 To support the growing \"tourist\" attractiveness of the site, the staff responsible for Pompeii began to think of leaving valuable paintings in situ under shelters. It was decided in this way in 1820 that a painting of Mars and Venus, should be left in place and protected by \"a box on the wall where it exists, to be opened at will\". In the following year, having decided to leave in situ other paintings, they put in wooden gates to prohibit entrance into unguarded houses. It is perhaps no coincidence that one year after the enactment of the new regulations for the ruins of Pompeii, and the first draft of the Regulations for the Royal Bourbon Museum in 1829, a general make-over of the excavations was carried out by consolidating the plaster and the walls (fig. 12), covering the paintings with a protective varnish using the new recipe invented by the Neapolitan painter Andrea Celestino, putting plates with names and numbers on the streets and houses, repositioning in situ slate copies of the most important inscriptions and gypsum replicas of the most beautiful statues from Pompeii in the Naples Museum (fig. 13). Even the local service structure was improved. At the suggestion of the Royal Academy of Archaeology, in 1824 a small restoration workshop was created in the excavations to restore the bronze objects before sending them to Naples, and a room was set up for the draughtsmen. In the meantime, far from Pompeii, the \"Essais de Restauration\" of Foreign Architects 59 started to be reflected in daring real reconstructions of Pompeian houses: so the Pompejanum (fig. 14) erected in 1841 in Aschaffenburg on the 55.

Among the first, and in a less poetic way, the idea had been advanced by the Earl of Salisbury in his visit to the Portici Museum in 1791 (fino 1988: 31 and note 28): to return to life an unearthed city would be a simpler and more beautiful idea. If all this furniture and these implements, at which we look emotionless ranged along the clean walls of a Museum crammed like an immense deposit of trinkets, had been replaced in good order in the houses of Pompeii, the illusion would be created in its entirety, and everything would arouse a greater respect and a stimulate greater curiosity (paraphrase by the Author). The political crisis of 1848 rang the alarm about the problems of the excavations. The King was obliged to accept to set up a Special Committee \"of learned people and egregious artists\" to \"procure a reorganization and reforms in Royal Bourbon Museum and in the Excavations of antiquities of the Kingdom\" which produced a draft proposal of an \"Organic Law for the Royal Museum of Antiquities and the Excavations\", which was never issued because of the violent end of the constitutional attempt. The Commission, very strict with the renovations and roofing projects in Pompeii 62 , dictated some specific articles of the Regulation on the way of carrying out the restorations, which constitute evidence of some \"best practices\" of the time (tiles at the top of the walls, propping, clamps for the plasters, seasonal straw protections for the most important paintings and sand covering for mosaics) 63 .",

It was left to one of the protagonists of the Commission of '48, Giuseppe Fiorelli, to accomplish some of its goals after Italian Unification. 64 Engaged in proving its superiority over the previous Italian kingdoms, including in the field of the protection of antiquities, the new Italian government, established by the Piedmonteses in 1861, allocated 110,000 Lira per year for the restarting of the excavations of Pompeii, almost in the manner of Caroline Murat, with as many as 512 workers. One year later King Vittorio Emanuele II personally inaugurated the new excavations of Herculaneum ( 1868 15). 66 During this period the use of photography for documentary purposes was consolidated (after its initial use for \"artistic\" and \"touristic\" purposes) (fig. 16) 67 , the Soprastanti were required to dig from the top of the ground down, and to observe and to register in the \"Giornale degli Scavi\", the Excavations Journal\" 68 even the smallest details because they would serve for the reconstruction of the ancient buildings, although Fiorelli still preferred graphic documentation. 69 Fiorelli showed a great prudence, even restraint, in the restorations, limiting himself to a very few interesting anastyloses such as the portico of the temple of Apollo (fig. 17) 70 . Eugene E. Viollet-le-Duc's praise of Fiorelli is significant 71 : he says that the new excavations at Pompeii after 1860 are \"directed and performed methodically and (...have the quality...) of preserving evidence that in other times was overlooked. The care is pushed as far as possible, and so the results are really instructive. Past mistakes have been corrected and we begin to have a pretty good idea of the construction of these houses and the way in which they were fitted with wood paneling and furniture.\"",

The painted walls just discovered, must be diligently cleaned and netted with tools and brushes designed to this purpose [...]. It is forbidden to work or scratch with iron tools any ancient object, having only to be cleansed from the soil surrounding it; translation by the Author). In the following report sent to the Minister of the Public Instruction in 1885 (fiorelli 1885: 58), he is very prudent regarding the restorations by reconstruction, stating that in view of them very accurate preliminary studies needed to be carried out: \"Occorre che ai restauri degli edifici riconosciuti degni di tutela procedano i necessari studi storici ed artistici, affinchÃ© coloro che devono attendervi, possano trasportarsi nell'etÃ in cui quelli furono innalzati e giudicare pienamente della loro esatta reintegrazione\" [â€¦]la conservazione dei monumenti e degli oggetti riuscirÃ completa quando sarÃ preceduta dall'opera di ricognizione piena di tutto ciÃ² che forma il soggetto della scienza; senza di che Ã¨ assolutamente impossibile decidere di ciÃ² che si debba conservare, e del modo di effettuarlo\" (\"It is necessary that the restoration of the buildings deserving protection should be accompanied by the appropriate historical and artistic studies, so that those tasked to carry them out can transport themselves to the period when those buildings were erected and fully judge on their exact reintegration \"[...] The conservation of the monuments and of the objects will fully succeed only when it will be preceded by the work of full examination of all that forms the subject of science; without that it is absolutely impossible to decide what it should be conserved and in which way\". Translation by the Author). Notwithstanding the focus on the most accurate restorations, it was accepted that, in case of urgent need to save paintings or mosaics considered of particular importance, they could continue to be removed from the buildings and sent to the Naples Museum, on the decision of the Council of the Superintendence and upon proposal of the Inspector assigned to the Excavations. 70. In his youth he shared the Chateaubriand's idea of a fully \"restored\" house in Pompeii. In the projected Law of reform of the excavations of Pompeii and the Naples Museum in 1848, under article 205-206 he wrote \"in Pompei sarÃ compiutamente restaurata una casa, le cui dipinture saranno fatte dai disegnatori del luogo. Si rimetteranno al loro posto gli oggetti rinvenuti e se vi si trovarono ossa se ne ricomporranno gli scheletri. Questa casa sarÃ mostrata come modello di un edificio pompeianoâ€¦\" (a house will be completely restored in Pompeii and its paintings will be executed by the local draughtsman. The objects found will be replaced in their sites, and if human bones were found, the skeletons will be reassembled. This house will be shown as a model of a Pompeian building). the excavations of Pompeii in the Naples Museum (fig. 18) 72 , how, except for those preserved in the Museum, most of the Pompeian paintings and mosaics could not be reproduced in miniature on the cork walls because they went already lost, and of them only the drawings and watercolors in the Archives remained. The only ones to survive were those conserved indoors or protected in a timely fashion by canopies: for example, the walls of the Baths, or the tablinum and other rooms in the House of the Hunt (VI, 4, 48), or the rear wall in the garden of the House of Sallustius, or of that of the Little Fountain (VI, 8, 23), or the peristyle of the House of the Dioscuri (VI, 9, 6).",

At first, this happened only 1748-1943: 294, cat. n. 3.10A. 74. To cover these roofs were used at first ancient tiles found unbroken in the excavations, without caring too much if they were removed , 8.6; excavation: 1879, 1881, 1902). Then, more and more systematically the issue of the full stylistic reconstruction was addressed: thus in the House of the Vettii (VI,15,1; excavated from 1894 to 1895), where not only the walls and roofs were rebuilt, but also the marble and bronze sculptures were left in place in the garden (fig. 22), in its turn replanted on the lines of the ancient plantings, while the fountains were put back into operation, as a plaque in honor of the Minister Guido Baccelli affixed on the dining room wall of the house proudly states. The example of this restoration was followed few years later in the House of the Golden Cupids (VI, 16, 7). According Antonio Sogliano, this new style of restoration had returned to Pompeii its \"artistic and archaeological interest\" 75 . Not only art: the repositioning of the \"cave canem\" mosaic in the House of the Tragic Poet had increased, on its own, the revenue from tickets, from 60,000 to 100,000 Lira!",

Moreover the new policy multiplied the size of the required maintenance, because of the increased from the true findspot.

It is much easier to learn about the health of the workers involved in the excavation, or even of the pack animals used to carry the trucks filled with pumice stones. In some other cases the reports are dotted with mere lists of the workers or of the actual work days. Translation by the Author). 77. In this period to protect the paintings glass sheets were used and clothes to be lifted through racks. They also moved from the use of metal clamps to the so called \"lacertini\" or \"solini\", concrete mortar strips to secure the edges of the ancient plasters and prevent the infiltration of rainwater.

Thus, although it would have been wiser to limit severely the new excavations, fitting them to the real maintenance capacity, the desire of both the Ministry and the archaeologists to dig ever more was stimulated by the great international echo that accompanied each new discovery.

The reinforced concrete used in floors and lintels was also new, but, alas the use of local volcanic pumice stone in the mixture instead of gravel, turned out to be a huge mistake, because the porosity of the pumice has caused, over time, the oxidation of the iron frames and the collapse of the structures. Another mistake was the introduction of asbestos-concrete, the so called Eternit, then a new technology (patented by the Austrian Ludwig Hatschek in 1901) which we now know to be toxic.

In his very extensive excavations, he not only resumed the systematic exploration of whole houses, but also practised on a large scale the reconstruction 79. Cfr. SPinazzola 1953; DelPino 2001. In the first part of his work (SPinazzola 1953: 18-32) he describes punctually his excavation and restoration methods in Pompeii. The cornerstones of them were: Â«1. Precisione e limitazione dell'obiettivo o degli obiettivi dello scavo, e continuitÃ cosÃ¬ nel proseguirli come nell'ubicazione di essoÂ» ; 2) Â«Cognizione ed impostazione dei problemi della ricerca, e fede in essaÂ»; 3) Â«Scavo sistematico per strati, con esame, avvicinamento e ricostruzione immediata, per strati, degli elementi architettonici rinvenuti e fotografati Â«in situÂ», e prima e poiÂ»; 4) Â«Impiego delle maestranze e tecnica dello scavo e dei restauriÂ».

Spinazzola had also proposed a diversification of restoration types. Where there were sure elements available for a faithful reconstruction of the ancient buildings, then it was the reconstruction of the floors and of the structures located on the upper floor was permitted. Where, on the contrary, there were no sure elements to carry out a scientifically reliable reconstruction then only protecting shelters were acceptable , using materials completely different from the ancient ones, such as roofs of tiles or metal sheets resting on steel beams, which should however, suggest in a way, the general frame of the ancient roof. 80. Such reconstructions had had antecedents in those executed in Sogliano's time, like the balcony of the House of the Cenacolo (V 2, g). 81. See the example in the Asellina's thermopolium, where, as soon the excavation ended, all the objects and the pottery found in the shop were exhibited on the selling counter, inside a glass showcase in an iron frame.

The result, in terms of image, had a great impact on Fascist propaganda, offering Pompeii as a virtuous example of the regime's ability to manage cultural heritage both in terms of protection and in terms of touristpromotion (fig. 26) 85 . We should remember, for example, that in 1934 the Torre Annunziata -Castellammare section of the Circumvesuviana railway was opened, with a new station at the excavations, named \"Villa of the Mysteries\", to make it easier to get to Pompeii from Naples. Maiuri himself promoted new popular activities in the excavations, adding lighting (fig. 27) for night visits and the use of the theaters for staging ancient dramas.",

(\"The doubt can only arise when we pass from a protective restoration to a reconstruction restoration, where the only rule to follow is dictated by the experience of those who have educated their eyes to the built and urban environment of Pompeii; the supreme and imperative law being that of honesty, without camouflage of the new for the ancient\" (translation by the Author). 85. Sarfatti,1924. (the tomb of Istacidii 86 , the tribunal of the Basilica (fig. 28), the portico of the Forum). The lack of resources, however, meant that the restoration entailed the use of precarious solutions, such as the reuse in reinforced concrete of iron nails rescued from old gates and floors. A mention should finally be made of the devastating effects of the repeated bombing that, aiming at a German division alleged to be stationed in the ruins, struck Pompeii in September 24 1943 to 26, with more than 150 bombs, provoking destruction in the Forum, the Antiquarium and in various houses of the city (fig. 29) 87 .",

Among the accompanying measures, the idea of selling the pumice (lapilli) from the archaeological layers covering the ruins to private quarry companies, authorized to take it out with the trucks from well inside the same ancient houses, caused serious damage and left a situation of incompleteness that has prevented restoration until few years ago, when it was possible to resolve it, if only partially.",

Not so much for the actual damage, resulting only in a few collapses, but more in a general weakening of the already crumbling walls of the city. Moreover, for the first time, taking a cue from some previous systematic initiatives, such as a general photo campaign promoted by the Istituto Centrale del Catalogo, and the National Photographic Cabinet 89 , it was possible to make an exact evaluation of the whole situation. For the first time the systematic survey of the damage and the computer processing of the quantitative data allowed us (I served then as Director of the Excavations 90 ) to show that Pompeii had been excavated too much, and that the most of it had been lost (about 80% of paintings and the floors found since the beginning of the excavations) and that the cost of the conservation of the surviving structures, including those reduced to bare ruins, was well above the current budget availability (fig. 30). The continued prevalent use of the excavations for profit, with a strong emphasis on tourist use, had not helped to improve the situation. In fact, internal maintenance was almost abandoned; masons and conservators had almost disappeared, replaced by custodial staff, while the increased number of visitors -currently running towards 3 million per year -further aggravated the problems: wear, graffiti on the plasters and eroded floors, added to the problems of invasive vegetation 91 , unchecked borders of the unexcavated areas (fig. 31), resistance to weathering and uncontrolled hydrogeology 92 . This longstanding maintenance crisis has produced in recent years periodic episodes of collapse of structures. The response has been wholly inadequate for the resumption of a smooth and continuous maintenance program: Instead, a number of special laws have solved some local issues but have left unresolved the general, systemic problem. The effort to rationalize maintenance initiated by P. G. Guzzo 93 was interrupted at the end of the term of that Superintendent, and the recent experience of the Special Civil Protection Commissioneers in Pompeii, has been dedicated mainly to enhancing touristic use through \"events\" 94 .

See a comment by Guzzo (2010: 7): \"Tutti ricordiamo che, secondo Winckelmann, gli ingegneri militari dell'esercito borbonico stavano al compito loro affidato di scavare Ercolano e Pompei come i granchi alla luna. In questo primo decennio del XXI secolo, piÃ¹ di due secoli e mezzo dopo quell'inizio, la situazione descritta dal Sassone sembra ripetersi con maggiore enfasi e una patina tecnologica, ma con simili proporzioni. Generali dell'aereonautica e soccorritori in caso di catastrofi naturali sono stati incaricati di prendersi cura di Pompei: stanti le rispettive formazioni professionali non potevano che tentare di o trasformare un'antica cittÃ in una caserma, oppure in una caricatura di se stessa, cosÃ¬ da abbagliare gli occhi di quanti desiderano essere solamente sbalorditi..\" (We all remember that, according Winckelmann, the military engineers of the Bourbons army stood in the same relationship to the task assigned to them to excavate Herculaneum and Pompeii as crabs were to the moon. In this first ten years of the 21st century, two and half century after that beginning, the situation described by the Saxon seems to repeat itself with a larger emphasis and a technological patina, but on a similar scale. Generals of the areas have been progressively reduced to a very few and slow cases like that of the House of Julius Polybius (IX, 13, 1-3), and the complex known as the House of the Chaste Lovers (IX, 12, 6, 7, 9), where the partial reconstruction of the buildings is still protected by a canopy waiting for a final solution according to new criteria that would take into account the problem of maintenance 95 .",

Aside from journalistic exaggerations, often moved by issues far from those of cultural heritage conservation, such an optimistic view has been put in question by events such as the Air Force and rescuers for cases of natural disasters have been assigned to care for Pompeii. Given their professional training they could only try to transform the ancient city into a barracks or a burlesque of itself, such as to dazzle the eyes of those who only wished to be stunned.\" (translation of the Author). 95. See BelloMo, M., 1999: 63-64. A recent dissertation at the Architecture Faculty of the Turin Politecnico has counted in Pompeii about 150 buildings with total or partial roofs or shelters of 29 different types, using different materials (www.architesi.polito.it/pdf/SalassaCM_ IT.pdf ); see also the lectures at the Bologna Conference of 2000 (http://www.arch.unipi.it/arco/novita/giornata.html). 96. \"Both sites, and Pompeii in particular, illustrate the evolution of conservation techniques over the past two centuries. The degree of reconstruction and the use of materials such as concrete and steel in restorations and reconstructions carried out before the 1980s would not be acceptable if performed today; they are, in fact, being replaced progressively by modern techniques and materials. It may be argued, however, that these early restorations have a historicity of their own which is worthy of some form of conservation. The wall paintings were in the past generally conserved using organic materials, which have caused little, if any, damage to them. However, the techniques used for remounting them using concrete were harmful, and a new method using instead aluminum and plastic, developed by the lstituto per il Restauro in Rome, is now being applied progressively to all the paintings. There are serious structural problems at both sites resulting from a variety of factors, such as inappropriate materials, rising damp, and rain and wind attack, and these were exacerbated by the 1980 earthquake... Several new approaches are being implemented at Pompeii. lnstead of concentrating on single buildings, restoration and conservation are being directed to entire quarters of the ancient town, consisting of one or more insulae, so as to achieve a more integrated result.\".",

We should also consider, if it proves to be necessary, drastic measures such as re-burying some areas. This work should be carried with the careful attention that John Ruskin recommended.I have had the good fortune to learn from an old worker on the Excavations: \"Take care of your monuments and you will not feel the need to restore them. Throw some lead sheets on the roof: a few leaves swept in time from the gutter will save the roof and the wall. Keep an eye on the old building with loving care, protect it the best you can at any price from any squandering influence. Count the stones and watch them; encircle it with an iron belt where it is breaking up, support it with wooden props where it declines. Don't fret because of this: it's better to have a crutch than only one leg. Do all this assiduously, with tenderness and with reverence and and many generations will be born under its shadow.\" Stefano De Caro stefadec50@gmail.com sdc@iccrom.org",
