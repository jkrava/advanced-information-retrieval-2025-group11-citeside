It was a sudden event, which occurred after centuries of inactivity, heralded only by earthquakes that repeated periodically, for many years, creating addiction rather than alarm. After the event, the vegetation covered the volcanic products, and the memory of the disaster was lost. The first excavations began in Herculaneum in 1738 and in Pompeii ten years later, in times when archeology still did not exist. Much was destroyed, given away, thrown away. Almost intact buildings emerged, with all their contents, with many inhabitants caught on the run. The arduous process of recovering the sites has had important and not always happy stages, accompanied by continuous progress in the excavation methods.",

      "text": "The eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE consisted in the formation of a convective eruptive column over thirty km high, followed by a convective/collapsing column producing pulsating pyroclastic density currents and ended with voluminous pyroclastic density currents. During the first part of the eruption pumices transported by the convective column fell in the direction of Pompeii where they gently accumulated up to form a deposit of about 3 m (Figure 1a). The first pyroclastic flows descended towards Herculaneum after 7-9 hours from the eruption onset and reached their climax about 18-19 hours from the eruption onset when they spread over the entire territory of the gulf. The onset of the pyroclastic flow activity was accompanied by a parallel increase of seismic shaking that reached its maximum right before the largest flow were produced. The eruption lasted no more than two or three days and between 4 and 5 cubic km of magma were emitted, mainly during the eruptive sustained column phase [Sigurdsson et al., 1985;Cioni et al., 1994]. The generalized stratigraphic column is shown in Figure 1b [Cioni et al., 1994] whereas in fig. 1a we show the deposit stratigraphy in the city of Pompei along with the corresponding eruption units. Many of the victims brought to light by the archaeological excavations in the town of Pompei were found, either inside (40%) the houses whose roofs collapsed during the pumice accumulation and the strong ground shaking or inside and outside (60%) the houses, above the pumice fall, and within the deposit of the pyroclastic density currents that enveloped the city during the second phase of the eruption [Giacomelli et al., 2003].",

The (fine) ash that covered them could not have been that of dense pyroclastic flows, formed by coarse pyroclasts and building material. In fact, not only does the \"rain of ash with water\" better reflect the characteristics of the deposits of expanded pyroclastic clouds, but the footprints remain clear only in a deposit composed by fine and homogeneous particle size, which mixes around the bodies, then hardens, while preserving footprint. The Villa di Diomede site is located in the area of Pompei closest to Herculaneum and, after the pumice fall, the first flows may have been the surges, expanded and fast, associated with the dense pyroclastic flows, slower and conditioned by the topography, which descended towards Herculaneum.",

A doubt that arises when observing one of the casts on display is whether the products on which the head rests, as if asleep, are the same on which it was found. A photograph of the excavations confirms the position, with the head higher than the thin layer on which the other corps lie, perhaps due to an irregularity in the thickness of the flow at that point or an attempt to raise the head in the last moment of life, as is more evident in a neighboring victim (Figure 6).",

At the far side of the excavation, a skeleton remains, still incorporated in the products of the flow that has wavy structures that deviate at every small obstacle, climb over the same skeleton, while containing coarse building material transported in suspension. Here too it could be assumed a flow with different concentration of solids and with different transport capacity. How then the bodies can remain composed, with an attitude \"more similar to the one who sleeps\" (Pliny the Younger description of the corps of Pliny the Elder) than to a human overwhelmed by a high temperature flow, capable of breaking down even thick walls, remains to be understood (Figure 9). The 1914 photographs of the garden of the Casa del Criptoportico [AA. VV., 1914;n. 6 in Figure 2] are not very clear. You can see the windows of the cryptoporticus, through which, the people found in the garden, may have fled; a group of at least seven, from which three casts have been made. Under the bodies there is a thin layer of ash and below, down to the ancient ground, the thick layer of pumice. At the edges of the excavation, the products of the flows that covered them can be seen. The photographs of the excavations show in the ground of the garden a trace, possibly wheel grooves, but there are no indications that these were left on the day of the eruption or by carts used during the excavation. The garden of the Casa del Criptoportico reveals a lot, but it raises even more questions (Figure 10 a-b).",

It is not possible, with this data, to establish the precise moment of the collapse, but the lowering of the floor of a ground floor room, intended to contain furniture and people, would require a very high load. The pumices caused the slightly sloping roofs to collapse after 40 cm of accumulation [Luongo et al., 2003] but, where it happened, the beams and tiles are also found on the floor below, which apparently do not exist here.

In 2017, during the renovation of a building of the Superintendency, a tomb with a long and important epigraph came to light and, next to it, two deep traces of carts. The measurements coincide with those obtained from the tracks of the wagons on the paving of the roads, 7-8 cm wide, distant from each other just under a meter. The interpretation of archeologists is that they were carts of the Pompeians on the run. Indeed, in the excavations of 1889, some fugitives were found outside Porta Stabia, but without wagons. It would be comforting to know that in such a dramatic situation it was still possible to put carts over three meters of pumice and reach the outside of the city. If the depth of the furrow is due to the still very soft and deformable ash (even from a single cart), then one would expect to find also footprints, human or animal. Lisetta Giacomelli et al.",

All the maps of the areas excavated from 1800 to 1881 show the west and south sectors of the city, including the Porta Stabia area (figures 13 a, b). Furthermore, in the western sector, in the direction of the walls, traces of wagons used to free the buildings from eruptive materials, were recognized under the materials accumulated later, reported by Antonio Sogliano in [1910] (as mentioned by Capurso, [2015]: the atrium was filled with earth and lapillus not in primary position (and) at about one meter above the original floor, the passage of wagons for the disposal of debris had to take place.
