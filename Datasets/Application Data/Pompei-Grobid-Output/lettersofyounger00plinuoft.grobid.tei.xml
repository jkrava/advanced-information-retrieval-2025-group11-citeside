<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To VOCONIUS EOMANUS.   Have you ever seen any one more cowed and abject than Marcus Eegulus, since the death of Domitian, under whom he perpetrated infamies as great as under Nero, though with more concealment ? He began to fear that I was angry with him ; and he was not mistaken, for I loas angry. He had fostered the perils which threatened Pais- ticus Arulenus, and had rejoiced in his death to such an extent as to recite and publish a book in which he insulted Ptusticus, and even called him " that ape of the Stoics." He added that he was " branded with a Vitellian scar." * You recognise tlie eloquence of Eegulus ! He mangled Heren- nius Senecio, and with such violence as to cause Mettius Carus to say to him, " What business have you with my dead ? Do / trouble Crassus or Camerinus ? "men whom Eegulus had accused under Nero. Eegulus believed that I took all this to heart, and, consequently, when he recited his book, did not invite me. Moreover, he remembered in what a deadly manner he had challenged me in the Court of the Centumviri.f I was counsel for Arrionilla, the wife of Timon, at the request of Arulenus Eusticus. Ee- gulus was on the other side. In a certain part of the cause we were relying on a decision of Mettius Modestus, a distinguished man; he was at that time exiled by Domitian. Just see what Eegulus did. " I ask you," says he, " Secundus, what is your opinion of Modestus ? " You observe what would have been the danger of giving a * A wound be had received while judges, as the name implies, divided taking the part of Vitellius. -Taci-into Chambers or Courts.

I cannot but think that the Gods themselves, and none else, came to my aid at that moment.</p><p>" I will answer," said I, " if it is upon this point that the Judges are to decide." He returned to the charge, " I ask you, what is your opinion of Modestus ? " I spoke a second time. "It used to be the custom to summon witnesses against persons on trial, not against those con- victed."</p><p>A third time he said, " I don't now ask what you think of Modestus, but what of the loyalty of Modestus ? " " You ask," I replied, " what I think ; but I apprehend that it is not lawful even to put an inqiiiry in reference to a matter which has been judicially decided." He was silenced. I received praise and con- gratulations for not having injured my reputation by an answer which might have been of advantage to me, but would have been dishonourable, and for having at the same time escaped involving myself in the snares of such an insiduous query.</p><p>So it was that, just now, with a terrified conscience, he laid hold of Cajcilius Celer, and next of Fabius Justus, with a request that they would restore him to my good graces.</p><p>Not satisfied with this, he made his way to Spurinna ; to him he says in a suppliant tone, most abject as he always is when he is frightened, " Pray do see Pliny at his house in the morningoh, but very early iu the morning-for I can't bear this anxiety any longer ; and contrive by any means whatever to avert his anger ! " I was awake when a message arrived from Spurinna : " I am coming to see you." I sent back word that I would rather go to him. "We met in the Portico of Livia on our way to each other. He set forth what Eegulus had charged him with, to which he added his own prayers to the same effect, though sparingly, as became a man of such excellence when pleading for one of a very opposite character.</p><p>I replied, " You shall yourself judge as to the message which you think should be taken back to llegulus.</p><p>are the only pay which could bribe me to the extent even of appearing against the Baetici.

I knew him inti- mately, in his domestic interior, in Syria, when in early youth I served in the army there, and laboured to gain his affection, though to be sure there was no need of labouring, for he is forthcoming and accessible and full of the courtesy which he preaches. And I only pray that 1 may have fulfilled the hopes which he then conceived of me in the same degree as he has added to his own virtues.</p><p>Or perhaps it is that I admire them more now in consequence of appreciating them better; though to do not, as so many do, envy others the boons lacking to myself, but, on the contrary, experience a certain sense of pleasure on observing that the advantages which are denied to me abound to the benefit of my friends.</p><p>(II.)</p><p>To Fabius Justus.</p><p>'Tis now some time since you have sent me any letters. "There is nothing," say you, "for me to write about."</p><p>Well, then, write this, that there is nothing for you to write about : or merely that with which your former letters used to begin.</p><p>" If you are well, all's right. I am well."</p><p>That will do for me, for it is of the highest interest.</p><p>Yout hink me joking ? I ask in all seriousness. Let me know what you are doing: a matter I cannot remain ignorant about without the gravest anxiety.</p><p>(12.) To Calestpjus Tiro.</p><p>I have suffered a very heavy loss, if parting with so great a man can be called a loss.* Cornelius Paifus is draw. After casting a glance around, " Why," said he, " do you suppose that I bear these dreadful pains so long ?</p><p>In order that I may survive that Irigand* if only for one day ! " If you could have given him a hody to match his soul, he would have carried into execution what he had in his mind.f However, Heaven granted the prayer, and, feeling that he could now die at peace and a free man, he severed the many but slighter ties which bound him to life.</p><p>The disease had increased upon him, though he endeavoured to mitigate it by abstinence. His determina- tion rescued him from its persistency. Two, three, four days had already passed. All the time he refused food.</p><p>His wife, Hispulla, despatched to me a common friend, C.</p><p>Geminius, with the melancholy news that Corellius had determined to die, and was not to be prevailed upon by her own or her daughter's prayers ; that I was the only person remaining who could recall him to life. I flew to him, and had almost reached his door when Julius Atticus, sent by the same Hispulla, announced to me that by this time not even I could have any effect on him, with such obstinacy had he gone on hardening in his purpose. Indeed, to the physician tendering him food he had said " KeKpiKa," J a M^ord which left in my mind as much regret as admiration.</p><p>I think what a friend, what a man I have lost. To be sure, he had completed his sixty- seventh year, an age sufficiently advanced even for the strongest, I know it. He has escaped from an unceasing malady. I know it. He has died, leaving a surviving family, and his country, which was dearer to him than all his belongings, in a prosperous condition. I know this too.</p><p>Nevertheless, I for my part lament his death just as though it were that of a man young and full of vigour, I lament it, moreoverthink me weak if you like on my own account. For I have lost a witness to my BOOK I. ig we praise and approve those who are not discouraged iu their zeal for writing and recitation by this Laziness, or else superciliousness, of their audiences.</p><p>I for my part have failed scarcely any one. Most of them to be sure were friends. Indeed there is hardly a man who loves literature but what he loves me too. On this account I have spent a longer time in town than I had intended.</p><p>I can now at last return to my country retreat and write something which shall not be recited, that I may not seem to have been tlie creditor, instead of the hearer, of those at whose recitations I was present. For, as in all other matters, so in this attendance of hearer, the favour ceases to be a favour, if a return be asked for. <ref type="bibr">(14.)</ref> To Junius Maueicus.</p><p>You ask me to look out for a husband for your brother's daughter, and you are right in laying this charge on me in preference to any one else. For you know how greatly I revered and loved that eminent man, how my youth was fostered by his counsels, by what commendations too he brought it about that I should seem worthy of being commended. You could not give me a more important or more agreeable commission, nor is there anything which I could with more propriety undertake, than this selection of a young man to be the parent of Arulenus Eusticus's grandchildren.</p><p>Yet I should have had to look for him for a long time if he had not been at hand and provided for you, so to speak, in the person of Minicius Acilianus, who is most closely attached to me, as one young man to another (he being my junior by a few years only), and at the same time reveres me as an elder. For it is his desire to be formed and instructed by me in the same way that I used to be by you two. His home is in Brixia, in that part of our country which still retains and preserves much of tlie always new. And I exhort and admonish you to do the same. Nor is it just that the fact of his being alive should stand in the way of his works. Can it be that, if he had flourished among those whom we have never beheld, we should be hunting up not only his books but statuettes of him</p><p>; and yet that this same man, because he is now present among us, should find his glory and credit enfeebled through our having, so to speak, too much of liim ? But surely it would be wrong and ill- natured not to admire a man in all respects worthy of admiration, just because it is our good fortune to see, to talk with, to he&amp;r, to embrace him, when besides merely praising him we can love him as well.* <ref type="bibr">(17.)</ref> To Cornelius Titianus.</p><p>Loyalty and duty are still a care to men ; there are still those who play the part of friends even to the dead. Titinius Capito has obtained from our Emperor an authority to put up in the Forum a statue of L. Silanus. 'Tis a noble thing and deserving of all praise to make such a use of the prince's friendship, to try what one's interest is worth by seeking honours for others than one's self.</p><p>It is quite in Capito's way to pay respect to great men. It is wonderful how reverentially and lovinglyin his own house, where he is at liberty to do sofhe treats the images of a Brutus, a Cassius, a Cato. The same individual has set forth the lives of all the most distinguished men in admirable poetry. You may be sure that he who so loves the virtues of others is himself replete with numerous virtues. So the honour which was his due has been paid to L. Silanus, whose immortality Capito has provided for, while at the same time providing for his * 'Wliich would not be the case if have been allowable to erect statues he were dead.</p><p>in public to anti-imperialists.</p><p>+ Even under Trajan it would not PLINY'S LETTERS. own. For it is no greater honour and distinction to enjoy a statue in the Forum of the Eoman people than it is to place one there.</p><p>(i8.)</p><p>To Suetonius Tkanquillus.</p><p>You write that you have been terrified by a dream, and are afraid of experiencing some ill-success in your law- suit ; so you beg me to apply for an adjournment, and to get off for a few daysat any rate for the first day. It is a difficult matter, but I will try what can be done. " For dreams descend from Jove ! " It is of some consequence, however, whether you are in the habit of dreaming what comes true or the reverse.</p><p>To me, as I think over a dream of mine, this subject of your fear seems to portend an excellent issue to your suit. I had undertaken the cause of Junius Pastor, when, in my sleep, my mother-in-law appeared to me, in a suppliant posture at my feet, beseeching me not to plead. Now I was about to appear, while yet a stripling, before the four Centumviral courts,* against men of the highest influence in the state, and, what is more, against friends of Csesarcircumstances each of which singly was enough to frighten me out of my wits after such a sad dream. I did, however, plead, reckoning, in the well-known words, that " The best of omens is my country's cause."   For here my honour seemed to me to stand in the place of my country, and, if possible, to be dearer to me than my country.f The issue was favourable, and, more than that, it was that very speech which opened for me the ears of men and the gates of fame.</p><p>In like manner, consider whether you also, with this For all the more jealously should an honour be guarded when at the same time the kindly act of a friend has to be preserved from being disgraced. * Avunculus, his maternal uncle; t About £800.

If you took counsel of these people, it w^ould be best not merely to speak briefly, but not to speak at all.</p><p>Such is, up to the present, my opinion, which I shall change if you dissent from it ; but in that case I shall ask you to explain clearly wliy it is that you dissent. For tliough I ought to give in to your authority, yet it seems to me that in a matter of such importance it would be preferable to yield not to authority but to reason.</p><p>Accordingly, if you do not think me wrong, write to that effectas short a letter as you please -still write, for you will be confirming my judgment. If you do think me wrong, prepare a prodigiously long one.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="31">(22.)</head><p>To Catilius Severus.</p><p>I have now been tied to Eome for a considerable time, and in a state of great agitation too. I am distressed by the long and persistent illness of Titius Aristo, the object of my especial admiration and regard. He is indeed unsur- passed in respectability of character, in virtue, in learning ; so that it is not so much one man as letters themselves and all the liberal arts which seem to be in the highest degree imperilled in the person of one man. What a knowledge he has of the law, whether relating to the state or to individuals ! Wliat a quantity of matters, what a quantity of precedents, what a mass of ancient lore, does he hold in his head ! There is nothing you want to learn which he is not able to teach you.</p><p>To me assuredly, whenever I am searching for some out-of-the-way infor- mation, he is a treasury of knowledge. To begin with, how reliable are his observations, and how weighty too, how modest and becoming his caution ! What is there that he does not know offhand ? Yet he constantly hesi- tates and deliberates, owing to the conflict of reasons which, with his keen and powerful judgment, he traces up to their sources and first principles, distinguishing between them and balancing them. Add to this his abstemiousness at table and the sobriety of his attire. His very chamber and his couch itself always seem to me, when I look at them, to present a kind of image of old-world simplicity.</p><p>All these qualities are set off by the grandeur of his soul, which does nothing with a view to display, and everything with a view to conscience, and seeks for the reward of virtuous deeds not from the applause of the vulgar, but from the deeds themselves. In short, none of your philo- sophers, who ad-vertise their love of wisdom by their external appearance, will easily stand a comparison with such a man as this. He does not, to be sure, haunt the gym- It will be no mean solace to my perturbed mind that you have nothing to complain of. <ref type="bibr">(23-)</ref> To PoMPEius Falco.</p><p>You ask my opinion as to whether you ought to plead causes during your tribuneship. It makes a vast difference what you hold the tribuneship to bewhether an empty shadow and a mere name without honour, or an authority invested with the highest sanctions, such as should suffer degradation at the hands of no man, least of all at those of the holder.</p><p>With regard to myself during my tenure of the office, I may perhaps have erred in imagining myself to be of some account ; yet, just as though I had been, I abstained from pleading causes. And this, firstly, because it appeared to me most unseemly that one in whose pre- sence every one is bound to rise, and to give place, should himself stand while every one else is sitting ; next, that one who can impose silence on all should himself be silenced by the hour-glass ; again, that he whom it is unlawful to interrupt should have to listen to actual scurrilities, and be looked upon as mean-spirited if he passed them over, and arrogant if he punished them. Moreover, there was this difficulty before my eyes ; suppose I had been appealed to in my official capacity, either by the person for whom, or the one against whom, I appeared. Should I interpose as tribune and aid him ? or should I keep quiet and hold my tongue, abdicating, so to speak, my magisterial office, and constituting myself a private individual ? Moved by these considerations, I preferred to exhibit myself as a tribune to all rather than an advocate to a few.</p><p>But as to you, I repeat, it makes a vast difference what you hold the tribuneship to be, and what sort of part you propose to play, which, in the case of a wise man, should be so fitted to him that it may be played out to the end. c always disagreeable, chiefly because it seems to reproach its OMmer with his folly. Now, in this little property, if the price be only favourable, there is much to tempt the fancy of my friend Tranquillusthe neighbourhood of the city, the easiness of access, the moderate size of the house, the extent of the land, enough to amuse, not to engross him. For your scholars (and such he is), when they are proprietors, are amply satisfied with so much of the soil as permits them to lift their heads from their books, refresh their eyes, crawl along their boundaries, always keeping to the same path, knowing all their tiny vines, and able to number their diminutive shrubs. This I have set before you .that you may better understand how much he will owe to me, and I to you, if he buys this little country place, recommended by so many attrac- tions, at such a reasonable price as not to leave room for repentance.</p><p>( 35 )</p><p>BOOK II.</p><p>To EOMANUS.   It is some years since such a splendid, and indeed memorable, spectacle has been exhibited to the eyes of the Eoman people, as that of the public funeral of Verginius Eufus, a citizen of the greatest distinction and renown, and one who was fortunate in an equal degree. For thirty years he survived his glorious deeds ; he read poems, he read histories WTitten about himself   ;   he was a witness to his own fame with posterity. He passed through his third consulship, thereby filling the loftiest station open to a subject, since he had refused that of a prince. He escaped those emperors by whom he had been suspected, and even hated, on account of his virtues ; and the best of them, the one who loved him most, he left behind him in life, as though he had been reserved for this very honour of a public funeral.</p><p>He outlived his eighty-third year, in the most perfect composure of mind, and the object of corresponding veneration. He enjoyed robust health, ex- cept that his hands used to shake, yet short of feeling pain.</p><p>Only, the approach of death * was somewhat severe and tedious ; though this circumstance itself was a credit to liim.</p><p>For as he was practising his voice,t in view to a speech of thanks which he had to make to the Emperor, on liis appointment as consul, tlie book he held, which happened to be of considerable size, slipped out of his handsaged as he was, and in a standing posture tooby its own weight. In the act of snatching at it to hold it together,* his foot failed him on the polished and slippery- floor; he fell and broke his hipbone, and his years pre- venting its being properly set, it would not come together again as it should. The obsequies of this great man have reflected the highest lustre upon the prince, upon the age, and upon the Forum and Eostra as well. His eulogy was pronounced by Cornelius Tacitus.</p><p>What a supreme crowning point to his good fortune to obtain the most eloquent of eulogists ! So lie, is gone, full of years and full of honours, even of those which he refused.</p><p>We have to miss him and regret him as a model of a bygone age ; I, for my part, particularly, who loved as much as I admired him, and that not merely from a public point of view. For, firstly, we came from the same part of the country ; our chief towns were contiguous ; and more than this, our estates and pro- perty joined each other.</p><p>In the next place, he was left my guardian, and always exhibited towards me the affec- tion of a parent.</p><p>So it was that, on the occasions of my candidature, he honoured me with his voice ; so he always hastened from his retirement to welcome me in all the offices I held, though he had long since given up this kind of complimentary visit ; so on the day when the Augurs usually nominate those whom they judge most worthy of the Augurship, he always nominated me. Nay more, dur- ing this last illness of his, fearing that he might chance to be appointed on the commission of five for reducing the public expenditure, which was being constituted by a decree of the Senate, although so many of his friends survived who were old men and of consular rank, he selected me, at my present age, as his substitute, and in these words too : " I would even intrust my son to you, if * The usual form of Roman books must be borne in mind.</p><p>BOOK IL 37 I had one." * These are the reasons which ohlio-e me to O pour my griefs into your bosom for a death which seems almost premature; if indeed it he allowable either to grieve for, or to call by the name of " death " at all, that which has put an end to the mortal existence rather than the life of so great a man. For he lives still, and will live for ever; he will even occupy a larger share in the thoughts and discourse of men now that he is withdrawn from their eyes. There were many other things which I wished to write to you, but my mind is entirely a prey to this one subject of contemplation. I think of Verginius.</p><p>I see Verginius. I hear, address, grasp Verginius in what are now vain but lively images. We possess, it may be, and shall hereafter possess, citizens his equals in great qualitiesin renown no one !

However, taking it to be as just as it is weighty, 1 am grievously angry with you for not having sent me any letters for such a long time.</p><p>There is only one way in which you can obtain my for- giveness, and that is by now at all events writing to me frequently and at great length. This is the only excuse which will seem to me valid ; all others will be treated as false.</p><p>I am not going to listen to this kind of thing -" I was not at Eome," or " I was too busy," As for this -" I w^as too unwell," why, the gods won't allow of that being said, I hope.</p><p>I myself am at my country-house, in the enjoyment partly of study, partly of indolence : retirement is the parent of both.</p><p>(3-) To Nepos.</p><p>Great was the reputation which had preceded Isseus, yet he was found to surpass it. His powers of speech, his copiousness, his richness are extraordinary.</p><p>He always speaks extemporaneously, but just as though everything had been written out long before. His language is Greek, indeed Attic. His prefatory remarks are terse, graceful, and agreealjle, at times of a grave and lofty tone. He calls for several subjects of discussion, and allows his hearers to make their choice, frequently even to select their sides.</p><p>He rises and composes his attire, then he begins.</p><p>At once, and almost at the same moment, every- thing comes to his hand, profound ideas present them- selves, and expressionsoh, such expressions ! -so choice and polished ! In these offhand effusions, a great amount of reading, a great habit of composition, are revealed. His preludes are to the point, his narratives clear, his attacks vigorous, his embellishments noble : in short, he teaches, delights, and moves you, so that you are in doubt as to which he does best. He indulges in frequent " enthymemata," * frequent syllogisms, concise and reasoned out, such as it is difficult to produce even with pen in hand.</p><p>His memory is incredible ; he will repeat from a long way back what he has spoken extempore, without a mistake in a word. To this degree of skill has he attained by study and practice ; for night and day he applies himself to nothincf else, hears and talks of nothing else.</p><p>He has passed his sixtieth year, and is still a scholar and nothing else-a class of men than whom none are more honest and straisjlitforward.</p><p>For we who undersjo the friction of the courts and of real lawsuits acquire a great spice of roguishuess into the bargain, albeit unwillingly.* Schools and lecture-rooms and fictitious causes are inno- cent and harmless affairs, and no less sources of enjoyment, particularly to old men. For what can be a greater source of enjoyment in age than that which is most delightful in youth ? Wherefore I for my part esteem Isceus not only the most eloquent but the happiest of men ; and if you are not eager to make his acquaintance, you must be made of stone or of iron. So, come, if not on other accounts, nor on my account, at any rate that you may hear him. Have you never read how a certain man of Gades,t moved by the name and renown of Titus Livius, came from the extremity of the earth for the purpose of seeing him, and the moment he had seen him went back \ It would be "  wanting in a sense of the beautiful," it would be the part of an illiterate, it would be dulness and almost disgrace, not to regard such an acquaintance as worth the troublethan which none can be pleasanter, none more honourable, in short, none more conformable to nature.</p><p>You will perhaps say, " I have here authors no less elo- quent, whom I can read." Very true ; but there is always an opportunity for reading, and not always one for hearing.</p><p>Besides, we are much more affected, to use a common ex- pression, by the living voice. For even suppose what you read to possess greater spirit, yet there will remain more deeply seated in your mind what the pronunciation, countenance, demeanour, and even the gestures of the speaker have implanted there. Unless, indeed, we esteem as false the well-known remark of ^schines, who, when he had read to the PJiodians an oration of Demosthenes, amidst universal applause, is reported to have added, "What if you had heard the roar of the least himself?"

But since, moved by the ties of consanguinity, I constituted myself his sole creditor by paying off all the rest (who, I won't say, were more pressing, but who at any rate looked more carefully after their money) ; and since, moreover, during his lifetime, I contributed a hundred thousand sesterces towards your wedding portion, besides that sum which your father guaranteed out of my property, as it were (for it was out of my property that it had to be paid)in all this you have a strong pledge of my kindly feeling towards you, in full reliance on which you ought to defend your departed parents' reputation and banded, that it may not be dried up by too great profusion.</p><p>It shall be husbanded, however, in the case of others : in yoiiT case, there will be a ready justification, even if the bounds be exceeded.</p><p>(5.)</p><p>To LUPEKCUS.</p><p>I have sent you the speech which you have so frequently pressed me for, and which has been so often promised by me ; not, however, as yet the whole of it, for a portion of it is still under final revision. Meanwhile I have thouo;ht it not amiss to submit to your appreciation those parts wdiich appeared to me to be in a finished state. On these I beg you to bestow the same close attention which they received from their author ;</p><p>for never yet have I had any- thing in hand which required me to exhibit more watchful care.</p><p>In my other speeches, my diligence only and trust- worthiness were submitted to the judgment of mankind ; here, further, my patriotism was concerned. Hence, the book itself has grown, while I rejoiced to celebrate and dilate upon my native country, and at the same time to help to defend it,* as well as to glorify it. Do you, however, cut out these very passages as far as reason shall dictate.</p><p>Tor when I consider the censoriousness and the whims of readers, I understand that their favour is to be sought by the moderate size in particular of a book. Yet, while exacting from you this strictness, I am at the same time compelled to put in an opposite request, that you will look with indulgence on many passages. Some conces- sions must be made to youthful ears, particularly if the subject-matter is not opposed to such handling. It is surely allowable to treat descriptions of places, which will be rather numerous in this book, not merely in a historical but almost in a poetical fashion. If, however, there be any one who thinks I have done this in a lighter way than the serious character of the oration requires, the severity, if I may so express it, of this reader must needs be deprecated by the remaining portions of the speech. I have at any rate striven to interest readers of the most opposite characters, by a great variety of styles, and just as I fear that particular parts will not, in accordance with individual tastes, be approved by some, so T am pretty confident that this very variety will commend the book to all as a whole.</p><p>For even in taking account of a banquet, though individually we may abstain from a number of dishes, yet we often unite in praising the dinner as a whole, nor do those viands which our taste rejects take away from the merit of those which have attracted it. Now I wish all this to be understood, not as believing myself to have succeeded, but as having laboured to suc- ceed, and that perhaps not in vain, if only you will devote your attention in the interim to what I have sent, and presently to what will follow. You will say that you cannot do this thoroughly unless you are first made acquainted with the entire speech. I admit it. For the present, however, what I have sent will become more familiar to you, and in this there will be certain correc- tions capable of being made in the parts. For if you were to inspect a head broken off from a statue, or some limb or other, though of course you could not gather from it its harmony and proportion to the rest, yet you might judge whether, taken by itself, it was a work of art or not. For this and no other reason, specimen numbers of books are circulated, because it is believed that a part may be complete in itself without the remainder.</p><p>The kind of charm there is in conversing with you has led me further than was intended ; here, however, I must end, for fear the limits which in my opinion should be observed even in an oration be exceeded in a letter.

It would be tedious to recall, nor is it of any conse- quence, how it came to pass that I (though but slightly acquainted with him), dined with a certain gentleman who unites, in his own estimation, splendour with economy, in mine, meanness with extravagance. For he and a few others had the best of everything served them, while the rest of the company had common fare and mere scraps.</p><p>Even the wine he had divided into three sorts, in little flagons; not that people might have the power of choosing, but that they might not have the right of decliniug ; one sort for himself and us, another for his humbler friends (for he puts his friends into categories), another for his and our freedmen. My next neighbour at table remarked upon this, and asked me if I approved of it. I said, No. " What custom, then, do you follow ? " says he.</p><p>" I set the same fare before everybody; for I invite people to dine, not to be invidiously ticketed, and I treat as my entu'e equals in all respects those whom I have made already my equals by placing them at my table ." " What, your freedmen too ? " "</p><p>Certainly ; for then I look on them as my guests, not my freedmen." " It must cost you a great deal," says he. " Not at aU," I replied.</p><p>" How can that be ?</p><p>" " Why, because my freedmen don't drink the same wine that I do, but I drink the same wine as my freedmen." And, by Hercules, if you only restrain your gluttony, it is no great hardship to share with a number of others what you use yourself. This gluttony, then, must be kept in check; it must, so to speak, be reduced to the ranks, if you would moderate your expen- diture ;</p><p>and it is somewhat better to arrange for this by curbing yourself rather than by insulting other people.</p><p>To what end all this ? In order that the show which some people make at their tables may not impose on memory of the deceased and the grief of his father, but also for an example. Youth will be incited to the practice of virtue by the establishment of such prizes, open to lads even, provided they be worthy of them. Men of lofty station will be incited to raise children, not only by their joy in those who survive, but by such glorious consolations in the case of those who are lost.</p><p>Tor these reasons I rejoice in the statue to Cottius on public grounds, and no less on private ones. I loved that most consummate young man as ardently as I now impatiently regret him. So it will be very pleasant to me to gaze from time to time upon this effigy of him; from time to time look back at it, to stand under it, to pass by it.</p><p>For if likenesses of the departed set up in our houses alleviate our grief, how much more must those which, standing in the most frequented places, recall not their appearance and their expression only, but also their great- ness and their glory. <ref type="bibr">(8.)</ref> To Caninius.</p><p>Are you studying ? or fishing ? or hunting ? or uniting all these pursuits ?

And if my zeal were not stimulated by this cause, I should in any case wish to see supported a young man of great virtue, principle, and attainments, one, in short, worthy of all praise, as are, indeed, the whole of his family.

For though your love of repose has sent you into retirement, yet there remains implanted in your mind a regard for the dignity of the commonwealth. Listen, then, to the transactions of the last few days, memorable from the great posi- tion of the personage concerned, salutary from the severity of the example set, and immortal owing to the magnitude of the affair.</p><p>Marius Priscus, being accused by the Africans, whom he had governed as proconsul, declined to defend himself, and requested to have judges assigned him.* Cornelius Tacitus and I, who had been appointed counsel for the pro- vincials, deemed it a part of our duty to inform the Senate that Priscus by his enormities and cruelties had trans- cended such charges as are capable of having judges assigned them, inasmuch as he had received bribes for the condemnation, and even the slaughter, of innocent persons.</p><p>Pronto Catius, in reply, deprecated inquiry being made into anything that was not covered by the * I.e., He declined defending liira-the graver charges brought against self in the Senate, and asked for a him.

Tliere was much dis- puting and clamouring on either side, some declaring that the jurisdiction of the Senate was bounded by the law ; * others that it was free and unfettered, and that in pro- portion as the accused had sinned, so he should be punished. At last, Julius Ferox, consul-elect, an honour- able and upright man, pronounced himself in favour of assigning judges to Marius in the interim, and, at the same time, summoning those to whom, it was said, he had sold the penalties inflicted on innocent persons. This opinion not only prevailed, but was absolutely the only one which, after these great disputes, was numerously followed.</p><p>Indeed, it has been shown by experience that although the first impulses of partiality and compassion are apt to manifest themselves with fire and vehemence, yet they will settle down gradually, extinguished, so to speak, by reflection and consideration. Hence it comes to pass that an opinion which a number of people will support with a confused clamour, no one will be willing to pronounce, when the rest are holding their tongues. Tor, when you are separated from the crowd, you get a clear view of many things which the crowd serves to conceal.</p><p>Those who had been summoned to attend made their appearance -Vitellius Honoratus and Flavins Marcianus.</p><p>Of these, Honoratus was charged with having bought, for three hundred thousand sesterces,t the banishment of a Eoman knight and the capital punishment of seven of his friends : Marcianus with having bought, for seven hun- dred thousand,"!" a combination of penalties inflicted on one Eoman knight; for he had been beaten with cudgels, * Their argument seems to have stopped from proceeding furthera been that Marius had virtually pleaded strange argument, guilty to the charge of extortion, &amp;c. , f About £2400. by demanding judges to estimate I About £5600. damages, and that the Senate was D condemned to work in the mines, and finally strangled in prison.</p><p>Honoratus, however, was withdrawn from the cognisance of the Senate by a timely death, and Marcianus was brought in, in the absence of Prisons.</p><p>Upon this, Tuccius Cerialis, a man of consular rank, proposed, in virtue of his senatorial right, that Prisons should have notice : either with the idea that he would be a greater object of compassion, or perhaps, on the other hand, of odium, if he were present ; or else (as I am strongly in- clined to believe) because it was most in accordance with justice that an accusation common to both should be met by each of them, and if it could not be refuted, should be punished in the person of each. The alfair was postponed till the next meeting of the Senate, the mere aspect of 'which was extremely grand. The Emperor presided, for he happened to be consul: add to this that it was the month of January, one of particular note on other ac- counts,* and also especially from the number of senators it brings together : moreover, the importance of the cause, the expectation and fame of it, which had increased by its postponement, the eagerness, innate in mortals, for an acquaintance with what is remarkable and unusual : all this had called forth every one from every quarter.</p><p>Picture to yourself our anxiety and apprehension, who had to speak on an affair of such moment in that assembly and in the presence of the Emperor. For my part, I have spoken in the Senate, and not once only ; more than that, there is no place where I am habitually listened to with greater favour</p><p>; and yet, at the moment, everything seemed strange to me, and pervaded me with a strange apprehension. In addition to the particulars above mentioned, the difficulties of the case presented themselves to me : there stood a man but lately of consular rank, lately * It was the month when the new gwenim, when the sense of ceZe6emmMS magistrates entered on their offices, will be different, and the meaning Mensis cum cetera turn praecipue will be, "A month which brings Senatoriini frequentia celeberrimus. together a number of senators in Cetera might here be taken with fre-particular, besides other people."

I spoke for nearly five hours : to twelve water-clocks of most liberal measure which had been allowed me, four fresh ones were added.! So greatly did the very topics which seemed to me, before speaking, to present difficulties, and to make against me, turn to my advantage when I did speak. The Emperor, indeed,   showed such favour towards me, such care for me even (perhaps solicitude would be too strong a term), that he frequently suggested to my freedman, who stood behind me, to beg me spare my voice and my strength, whenever he thought I was exerting myself with greater vehemence than my delicate frame might be able to bear. Claudius Marcellinus replied to me on behalf of Marcianus. There- upon the Senate rose, being adjourned to the following day ; for by this time a fresh speech could not have been entered on without being cut short by nightfall.  iSText day, Marius was defended by Salvius Liberalis, a subtle, methodical, incisive, eloquent speaker, and to be sure in this case he put forth all his powers.

By way of conclusion to his motion, he farther proposed that inas- much as Tacitus and I had discharged the ofhce of advocate imposed on us with diligence and intrepidity, the Senate adjudged that we had acted in a way worthy of the func- tions assigned us.</p><p>The consuls-elect assented to this motion, and, indeed, all the men of consular rank, till it came to the turn of Pompeius Collega : he opined for pay- ing the seven hundred thousand into tlie Treasury, and also banishing* Marcianus for five years, but for being contented, in the case of ]\Iarius, with the penalties for bribery which he had already incurred. There were many for each of these proposals ; perhaps, on the wliole, a majority for the latterthe more lenient, not to call it the laxer, of the two. For some even of those who had seemed to agree with Cornutus now followed this senator, who had given his opinion after themselves. However, when a division took place, those who stood by the consuls' chairs began to go over to the side of Cornutus. Whereupon, those who still allowed themselves to be numbered with Collega crossed to the opposite side of the House, and Collega was left with a small following. The latter complained after- BOOK II.   53 wards a good deal of tliose who had set him on, particu- larly of Regulus, who had left him in the lurcli on a motion which he (Regains) had himself prompted. Indeed</p><p>Eegulus is generally of such a fluctuating disposition, that he is full of daring and full of cowardice as well.</p><p>Such was the end of this most important investigation. There still remains, however, a public matter of some importancethe aftair of Hostilius Firminus, lieutenant to Marius Priscus, wdio was implicated in the cause, and got very roughly handled. For Martianus's cash accounts, and also a speech which he made to the senators of Leptis, proved that he had lent his aid to Priscus for services of the basest kind; that he had covenanted for fifty thousand denarii* to be paid by Marcianus; that he had further received in person ten thousand sesterces, under a most disreputable title, that of " purveyor of perfumes," a title not ill-suited to the manners of the man, wdth his per- petual trimmed hair and levigated skin. It was resolved, on the motion of Cornutus, that his case should be laid before the Senate at its next meeting ; for at that time, whether accidentally or from the effect of conscience, he was absent.</p><p>So now you have the news of the town. Write me in return that of the country.</p><p>How are your shrubs doing, and your vineyards, and your corn crops, and those choice sheep of yours ?

Firminus, brought before the Senate, answered to a charge which was patent. Then followed conflicting proposals on the part of the consuls-elect. Cornutus</p><p>Tertullus moved that he be expelled the Senate ; Acutius IS^erva that in the assignment by lot of provinces his name be left oiit.f This latter proposal carried the day, as being the more lenient, whereas it is, in fact,| the harsher and severer of the two. For what can be more miserable than to be cut off and excepted from the privileges of the senatorship, and yet not to be exempt from its labours and its annoyances ? What can be more oppressive than for a man, to whom such ignominy has been attached, not to be able to hide away in solitude, but to have to exhibit him- self as a sight and a show on so lofty an eminence ? In addition to this, what, from a public point of view, can be more incongruous or more indecent than that a person branded by the Senate should sit in the Senate, and should be on equal terms with the very persons who have branded him; that one debarred from a proconsulship for his dis- graceful conduct in his lieutenancy should yet sit in judg- ment on proconsuls, and, after being condemned for his own dirty practices, should condemn or acquit others. Yet so the majority decided.</p><p>Votes, you know, are numbered, not weighed.

But I have bound myself by a kind of law of my own, to carry out the wishes of the dead, even though legally incomplete, just as though they were in perfect form.

It is only seventeen miles distant from town, so that liavimj cot through all you had to do, you can go and stay there with your day's work already secured and disposed of.''' There is access to it by more than one road, for the Laurentine and Ostian highways lead in the same direction ; only, you must branch off from the Laurentine at the fourteenth and the Ostian at the eleventh milestone. Either way, the next part of the road is for some distance sandy, rather heavy and slow-going for a pair, but short and soft for a saddle- horse.</p><p>The prospect is constantly varying : at one time the road is hemmed in by woods which close in upon you : at another, it stretches through broad pastures and opens out before you : you see numerous flocks of sheep, and troops of horses, and herds of cattle, which are driven down from the hills in winter, and grow sleek on the herbage and in the spring temperature. The house is sufficient in point of accommodation without being expen- sive to keep up. As you enter, there is a vestibule, plain but not mean ; next a hall with columns, rounded in the form of the letter D, enclosing a small but pleasant space, an excellent retreat against stormy weather, being pro- tected by glazed windows and still more by overhanging eaves.</p><p>Facing the middle of it is a courtyard of cheerful aspect; next, a rather handsome dining-room which projects on to the shore, so that whenever the sea is raised by the south-west wind, it is just wetted by the last spray of the broken waves. It is furnished all round with folding- doors, or windows as large as folding-doors, so that with its sides and its front it faces as it were three different seas.</p><p>At the back it looks through the courtyard, the hall with the columns, the open space, the haU again, then the vestibule, right to the woods and distant hills. To the left of this, a little way back, is a large saloon, and next * SaJvo jam et composito die is other sense out of the words than variously rendered : but I can get no that given above.</p><p>to it another smaller one, which admits the morning sun through one window and enjoys the last of the evening sun through another. From this there is a more distant but more sheltered view of the sea below. By the projection of this saloon and the dining-room just mentioned, an angle is formed which holds and intensifies the bright- est sunshine. This is my winter-snuggery, this is also the place of exercise for my household : here every wind is stilled, except such as bring clouds with them, and only drive us from the spot by obscuring the clear sky. In connection with this angle is a saloon with a dome-shaped roof, with windows on all sides so as to follow the circuit of the sun ; in its wall, shelves are inserted, like those of a library, holding books of the kind that are not merely read but studied. Adjoining this is a sleeping-room, with a passage intervening, which is furnished with pipes under- neath so as to circulate and supply the warm air which it collects at a wholesome temperature. The remainder of this wing serves for the accommodation of the slaves and freedmen, most of the rooms being so neat that they might be occupied by my visitors.   In the opposite wing there is a tastefully decorated saloon, and next to it what may be called either a large saloon or a moderate-sized dining parlour, which is brightened by a profusion of sunshine and an extensive sea-view : behind this a room with an anteroom, suitable for summer use owing to its height, and for winter from the manner in which it is protected, for it is out of reach of any wind. To this chamber another one with an ante- room is attached by a party-wall. Next comes the cooling room of the bath, spacious and wide, from the opposite walls of which two curved plunging-baths are thrown out, as it were, quite large enough when you remember that the sea is close by.* Adjoining this is the sweating and anointing room, and next to that the passage communicat- ing with the bath-furnace, then two small apartments in BOOK II.   63   an elegant rather than costly style : in continnation is a splendid warm swimming-bath, from which the swimmers have a view of the sea; not far off is the tennis-court, which faces the warmest sun in the afternoon. Here a tower is erected with two sitting-rooms under it, and the same number in it, in addition to a dining-parlour which looks upon a broad expanse of sea and a long line of coast with charming villas. There is also a second tower, and in it a room which enjoys both the rising and setting sun : behind it a spacious storeroom and granary, and below a dining-room, which, when the sea is rough, is exposed only to its roar and its noise, and even that much sub- dued and but faintly heard. It looks upon the garden and the promenade which encloses the garden. This pro- menade is planted round with box, or with rosemary where the box fails ; for box, when protected by buildings, grows freely ; in the open air and exposed to the wind and the spray of the sea, even at a distance, it withers. Next to the promenade, in the inner circle which it forms, is a plantation of young vines, affording shade, and soft and yielding to walk in, even with bare feet. The garden is clothed with a number of mulberry-trees and fig-treestrees which the soil hereabouts is particularly productive of, while it is unfavourable to other kinds. This is the prospect, no less agreeable than that of the sea, which is enjoyed from the dining-room out of sight of the sea. It has at its back two parlours whose windows command the vestibule, and another garden, a productive kitchen one.</p><p>From this point run out some cloisters, almost important enough for a public construction. There are windows on both sides, but the greater number on that of the sea, those facing the garden being single ones, and fewer by the alternate corresponding windows, which are left out.* * Utrimquefenestrae,amaripJures, siugulae," would be clearer.</p></div>

The cloisters increase, by their radiation, the warmth of the sun which strikes on them, and in like manner as they hold the sun, they also repel and ward off the north wind ; so that the warmth which they give in front is equalled by the coolness they afford behind. In the same way they arrest the south-west wind, and thus, by means of one or other of their sides, they break the force of, and put an end to, winds coming from the most opposite quarters. These are the advantages of the cloisters in winter ; in summer they are still greater. For before midday they keep cool the terrace walk, and in the after- noon the part of the promenade and the garden nearest them, by their shadow, which, according as the day in- creases or declines, falls longer and shorter on this side or on that. The cloisters themselves, however, are most free from sun when the sun strikes with its fiercest heat directly on their roof.</p><p>Add to this that through their open windows the west winds are received and transmitted, so that they are never rendered unpleasant by closeness and want of circulation in the air.</p><p>At the end of the terrace is a chalet, which I am quite in love withyes, literally in love withfor I built it myself.</p><p>In it there is a sunny apartment which faces the terrace walk on one side and the sea on the other, and on both sides enjoys the sun ; also an apartment with folding- doors which open on the cloisters, and a window towards the sea.</p><p>In the middle of the M^all there is a very tasteful recess, furnished with a glass partition and curtains, by thegar(len,separate(.S(wr/!(^ae)winclows * When the north wind blew from were inserted in the wall, the blank the garden-side, the windows on that space between them corresponding to side would be shut, and those on the an opposite window on the sea-side.</p><p>sea-side opened, and vice versa.</p><p>BOOK II.</p></div>

At your feet you have the sea, behind you the neighbouring villas, at your head the woods. Such is the variety of scenes, which may be viewed separately through as many windows, or blended in one. Next to this is a sleeping-room for the night, impervious to the voices of the slave-boys, the murmur of the sea, the raging of storms, the flash of the lightning, to the light of day even, unless the windows are oj)ened. The cause of such deep and isolated seclusion is, that an intervening passage separates the wall of the bedroom from that which faces the garden, and so every sound is deadened by this empty space lying between the two. In connection with the sleeping-room is a small heating apparatus, through which the heat underneath is given out or retained, as occasion requires, by means of a little trap-door. Beyond this a bedroom with a dressing-room project towards the sun, catching it as soon as it rises, and retaining its raysthough they fall on it ohliqudyat anyrate, retaining them, till after midday. On betaking myself to this chalet, it seems to me that I have got away even from my own villa, and I derive especial enjoyment from it at the time of the Saturnalia, while the other parts of the establishment are ringing with the license and the mirthful shouts of that season ; for then I am no impediment to the gambols of my servants, nor are they to my studies.</p><p>Amidst all these conveniences and attractions there is a want of running water ; but there are wells, or rather springs, for they are on the surface. Indeed, the character of this sea-coast is altogether remarkable; at whatever place you turn the soil, an immediate supply of water pre- sents itself, quite pure, and not rendered in the slightest degree brackish by the immediate vicinity of the sea. The neiQ[hbourinCT woods furnish fuel in abundance ; the rest of our supplies the town of Ostia finds us. Indeed, a man of moderate requirements might be sufficiently provided E even at the neighbouring village, which is separated from me by one gentleman's residence only. In this village there are three public baths, a great convenience whenever either an unexpected arrival, or want of time, prevents us from heating the bath at home. The coast is ornamented in the most pleasing variety by villa con- structions, at one place continuous, at another detached, so as to present the appearance of a number of towns, whether you look at them from the sea or the shore itself. This last is often smooth after a long calm, but it is more often hardened by the constant beating of the waves upon it.</p><p>The sea does not abound in choice fish, it is true, yet it yields excellent soles and lobsters.* My villa, however, furnishes inland produce as well, milk especially ; for the cattle collect here from their pastures, whenever they are in search of water or shade.

This zeal and fidelity I owe to you, and to the memory of your brother, particularly in a matter of such importance. For what can be of greater import to you than that these boys (I would say, of yours, but that now you love them more than if they were your own) should be found worthy of such a father as him, such an uncle as you!an object of solicitude which, even if you had not enjoined it on me, I should have appropriated to myself.</p><p>Not that I am unaware that many jealousies will have to be incurred by me in this matter of choosing a teacher : however, it is my duty to put up with such jealousies, and even with ill-will, on behalf of your nephews, as readily as parents do on behalf of their ovv^n children.</p></div>

The consequence is, that those who speak sitting, though they may enjoy in other respects nearly the same advantages as those who stand, yet, from this very circumstance that they are seated, are, as it were, debili- tated and depressed. In the case of those indeed who recite, the chief aids to expression, the eyes and hands, are impeded : hence it is not to be wondered at that the attention of the audience languishes, when charmed from without by none of the graces, and roused by none of the stings of oratory.</p><p>To this must be added that the oration to which I am referring is of a disputatious and argumen- tative character.</p><p>Moreover, it is only natural to suppose that what we have written with pains will put the hearer to some pains as well. And, to be sure, how few hearers there are so unprejudiced as not to be pleased rather with those sweet and harmonious periods than with what is dry and concise ? This divergence of taste is truly discredit- able ; yet it exists, since it generally happens that the audi- ence requires one thing and the judges another, whereas, on the contrary, the hearer ought to be particularly affected by that which would move him most of all if he were himself in the position of a judge.</p><p>Yet it may happen that, in spite of these difficulties, the originality of the work may recommend it : its originality, that is, in our country.</p><p>The Greeks have a certain mode of treatment, which, though the converse of mine, is not altogether unlike it.

This is a mode of treatment which, being anything but agreeable to the ears of the ici;norant, ouoht to obtain all the more favour from those who are instructed, in proportion as it obtains less from those who are not.

Eegulus called upon her. Consider, first, the impudence of the fellow in calling on a sick woman, when he had been the greatest enemy to her husband, and was extremely odious to herself.</p><p>However, this might pass, if he had called merely. What did he do but actually seat himself close to her bed and interrogate her on the day and hour of her birth ! As soon as he had been informed, he makes up his face, stares out of his eyes, wags his lips, sets his fingers in motion, calculates ; no result ! After keeping the poor lady a long while on the tenter-hooks of expecta- tion, " You are," says he, " in a critical period ; however, you will escape, and to make you more sure of this, I will consult a soothsayer whom I have frequently employed." No sooner said than done ; he goes and offers a sacrifice, and declares that the entrails tally with the prognostics of the stars.</p><p>With the usual credulity of persons who are in danger, she calls for her tablets and writes down a legacy for Eegulus. Before long she grows worse, crying out with her dying breath upon the roguery and perfidy of the fellow, and his worse than perjury, since he had forsworn himself to her by the life of his own son.</p><p>Eegulus does this frequently, and no less wickedly, since he is invoking the anger of the gods, whom he himself deceives daily, on the vicarious head of his unfortunate boy.</p><p>Velleius Blaesus, the wealthy man of consular rank, being at the point of death, was desirous of altering his will.</p><p>Eegulus, who had lately taken to toady him, hoped for something from a new disposition of property, so h-e began to exhort and to entreat the doctors to prolong by all means in their power the good gentleman's life. As soon as the will was executed, he changed his roh, and reversing his tone, called out to the same doctors, " How long are you going on tormenting the poor man ? Why grudge an easy death to one on whom you cannot bestow life ? " Blsesus died, and, as though he had heard every- thing, left not a rap to Eegulus.</p><p>Will these two stories do for you, or, after the fashion of the schools, do you call for a third ? * Well, I have the materials. Aurelia, a lady of distinction, being about to execute her will, had clothed herself in her handsomest attire.f Eegulus having come to attest it, said, " I beg you will leave me those clothes of yours." Aurelia thought the man was jesting, but he insisted seriously. To make a long story short, he compelled the lady to open her will and to bequeath to him the clothes she had on ; he watched her as she was writing, and looked to see whether she had written the bequest. Aurelia, to be sure, is still alive, though he compelled her to do this, just as though she had been at the point of death.

And for my part, just as the stars with their fixed course, so do the lives of men best please me when they are methodical, and this particularly in the case of old men. In young men a cer- tain confusion as yet, and a certain disorder, so to speak, are not unbecoming : a general repose and regularity are suitable to age, a time when activity is out of date and ambition is discreditable. To this regularity Spurinna most steadfastly adheres ; nay, more, he goes through a round of the following small occupationsthat is, such as would be small if they were not done dailyin a kind of order, and, as it were, orbit.</p><p>In the early morning he lies on his couch ; at eight o'clock he calls for his shoes ; then he walks three miles, exercising his mind all the time as well as his limbs. If friends are with him, there is conversation of a most elevated kind; if not, a book is read to him, and that, too, sometimes even when there are friends present, provided always it does not inconvenience them.</p><p>Then he sits down, and there comes a book again, or con- versation in preference to a book. Soon afterwards he steps into his carriage, taking with him his wife, a woman of a remarkable character, or else some one of his friends, as, for BOOK III.</p><p>72, instance, lately, myself.

From all this it results that, though he has completed his seventy-seventh year, he has the perfect use of his ears and eyes, with a frame active and full of vitality : his sagacity alone he owes to his age.

I propose, then, to myself the same course as his and the same goal; and now at once enter into an engagement with you to that effect, so that if you should see me carried beyond the mark, you may call me to account on the strength of this letter, and bid me go into retirement when I shall be able to do so without incurring the charge of indolence.</p><p>(2.)</p><p>To Maximus.</p><p>What I should have voluntarily offered your friends, had I the same abundance of opportunities as yourself, I now think myself entitled to ask of you for my friends.

But he lacks ambition ; consequently he has contented himself with the grade of a knight, though he might with ease rise to the highest rank.</p><p>It must be my business, however, to see that he is advanced and honoured. It is therefore a great point with me to add somewhat to his position, without his expecting, without his knowing, or perhaps even desiring it ; moreover, to add to it in a way which shall confer lustre with- out entailing trouble on him.

As to the value of his eloquence, there are many whose word you may take on that point, for his powers of speech, being evident and on the surface, are immediately perceived. The existence of man, however, conceals deep recesses and huge secret nooks, and on this head you must accept me as sponsor for Genitor. From this individual your son will hear nothing that will not be of advantage to him ; he will learn nothing which it would be better not to have learnt, nor will he be less frequently reminded by Genitor than by you and by me of the ancestral effigies with which he is weighted, of the names, and the great names, he has to maintain.

My excellent colleagues, full of regard for me, began to talk of the engagements of our common office, and sought to make my excuses and get me off. The Senate passed a decree. BOOK III.</p><p>'j'j extremely flattering to me, to the effect that I should be appointed to defend the interests of the provincials, if they should first have obtained my personal consent. The envoys being again introduced, a second time demanded me (who was by this time present) for their advocate, im- ploring my assistance, which they had already enjoyed against Massa Bsebius, and alleging a compact on my part to defend their interests. The Senate received this with the loud applause * which usually preludes their decrees.</p><p>Upon this I said, " Conscript Fathers, I cease to think that I have alleged any just grounds for excusing myself."</p><p>The modesty of this speech and the way the thing was put were approved. I was urged, however, to this resolve of mine not merely by the unanimity of the Senatethough this had the greatest weightbut by other consi- derations, which, though of less, were still of some account.</p><p>It occurred to my mind that our ancestors pursued the wrongs down even to individual friends, and that too by prosecutions voluntarily undertaken ; hence I deemed it all the more disgraceful to neglect the duties imposed by a public connection. Lloreover, when I recollected what were the actual dangers incurred by me on behalf of these same Bistici on the first occasion of my appearing for them, it seemed to me that the value of past obligations would be best preserved by the addition of new ones. Indeed things are so constituted that services of older date are cancelled if you do not heap fresh ones on them. For however often you may have obliged people, yet if you refuse them any one thing, this thing which you have refused is the only one which they will remember. I was further prevailed upon by the fact that Classicus was dead, and the consideration, which is generally the most painful in cases of this kind, removed -I mean the danger run by a senator. Hence I saw as the result of my advocacy no less success than if he had been alive, with the absence of all * Clarissima assensione.</p><p>Gierig orable to me."

" The Life of Pomponius Secundus, in two books," a man who had cherished a singular regard for him, so that in this work he discharged, as it were, a duty which he owed to the memory of his friend. " The Ger- man Wars, in twenty books," in which he collected all the wars which we have waged with the Germans. This he commenced durmg a campaign in Germany, by admoni- tion of a dream. During his sleep there stood by him the form of Drusus Nero (who, after triumphing far and wide over the Germans, died in their country), commending his memory to my uncle, and entreating the latter to rescue him from unmerited oblivion. " The Student, in three books," divided into six volumes on account of their length, in which the orator is trained from his very cradle and perfected, " On Doubtful Phraseology, in eight BOOK IIL 79 books." He wrote this under Nero, in tlie last years of his reign, when every kind of literary pursuit which was in the least independent or elevated had been rendered dan- gerous by servitude. " A Continuation of Aufidius Bassus, in thirty-one books." "Natural History, in thirty-seven books," a work of great compass and learning, and no less varied than nature itself.</p><p>You are astonished that a busy man should have com- pleted such a number of volumes, many of them on such intricate subjects ; you will be still more astonished when you learn that for a considerable time he practised at the bar, that he died in his fifty-sixth year, and that between these two periods he was much distracted and hindered, partly by the discharge of important offices, and partly by his intimacy with the emperors. But his was a piercing intellect, an incredible power of application, an extra- ordinary faculty of dispensing wdth sleep. He began to work by candlelight at the feast of Vulcan, not with the view of seizing an auspicious occasion, but for the purpose of study immediately after midnight ; in winter, indeed, at one o'clock in the morning, or at the latest at two, often at midnight.* To be sure sleep came to him very easily, over- taking him at times, or leaving him, even in the midst of his studies. Before daybreak he used to repair to the Emperor Yespasian (who as well as himself worked by night), and after that to his official duties.</p><p>On his return home, he gave the rest of his time to study.

In- deed, he read nothing without making extracts ; he used even to say that there was no book so bad as not to contain something of value. After his sunning he commonly took a cold bath ; then he lunched * and went to sleep for a very short time.

When travelling, as though freed from every other care, he devoted himself to study alone.

It repre- sents an old man standing : bones, muscles, sinews, veins, wrinkles even, appear as of one breathing, the hair is scanty and retreating from the brow, the forehead broad, the face shrivelled, the neck thin, the arms droop, the breasts are flat, the belly is drawn in. The back exhibits the same age, as far as a back can. The brass itself, to judge from its colour, which is of the right sort, must be antique.</p><p>In short, everything about it is of a character to arrest the eyes of an artist, as well as to delight those who are not connoisseurs. And this it was Avhich tempted such a tyro as myself to the purchase. /However, I have bought it, not to place in my house (where up to this time I have never had anything in the way of Corinthian brasses), but for the purpose of setting it up in my native parts in some frequented place, and for preference in the temple of Jupiterj, for it seems an offering worthy of a temple and worthy of a god. Will you, then, with your usual attention to my commissions, undertake to see to this, and at once order a pedestal to be made, of any kind of marble you please, to contain my name and titles, if you think the latter should be added ? I will send you the figure itself as soon as 1 can find some one who will not be incommoded by it, or (which you would prefer) will bring it with me in person.

An incurable swelling had appeared on his person, wearied with which he hastened to die, with a resolution not to be diverted from its purpose. He was blessed by fortune and happy down to his last day, except that he lost the younger of his two children ; yet the elder and the better of the two he left behind him in prosperous circumstances, indeed in the position of a consular.* He had injured his reputation under Nero, when he was believed to have played the accuser officiously ; but, as a friend of Vitellius, he had conducted himself wisely and in a popular way.</p><p>He had brought back with him great repute from his ad- ministration of Asia, and had effaced the stain of his old industry t hy a life of laudable repose. He was among the chief men of the state, possessing no power and arous- ing no hostility. He had many visitors and much atten- tion shown him ; and, reclining a good deal on a couch in his apartmentalways a resort for company, though not from regard to his fortunes jhe passed the days in learned discourse, when he had leisure from writing. He wrote poems with more pains than genius, and occasionally tested the taste of the public by reciting them. In the * ConsM?arts, elsewhere translated "industry" hardly expressing it.

The French " indus-visited for his own sake, not courted trie" exactly renders this, for which as a man possessing great power, for we have no exact word in English : he had none. end, influenced by his years, he retired from Eome and confined himself to Campania, nor was he drawn thence even by the accession of a new emperor. Great credit is due to Caesar, under whom it was free to hifn to act tlms, and to liim also for daring to profit by this freedom.* l^e was a coUector.t to such an extent as to be chargeable with a mania for buying. He had several villas in the same places, and, as soon as he had conceived an affection for the new ones, used to neglect the old. He had every- where a quantity of books and statues and busts, which last he not only possessed but actually worshipped, that of Virgil above all others, whose birthday he used to cele- brate more religiously than his own, particularly at Naples, where he was wont to repair to his tomb as to a temple.</p><p>In this condition of repose he outlived his seventy-fifth year, being of a delicate rather than an infirm constitu- tion.</p><p>As he was the last consul made by Nero, so he was the last to die of all those whom Nero had made consuls. And this, too, is remarkable : the last to die of Nero's consuls was the man in whose consvilship Nero himself perished.</p><p>When recalling this, I am seized with pity for the transient condition of humanity. For what can be so circumscribed, so short, as the life of man at its longest ?

So for my part I conform to this most laudable desire of yours.

Whence this variety ?</p><p>Whence these numerous pleadings ? Csecilius Classicus, a detestable man, practising no concealment in his guilt, discharged the proconsulship in that province, with as much lawlessness as low avarice, the same year that Marius Prisons was in Africa. Now Prisons came from Bcetica, and Classicus from Africa. Hence a saying of the Baitici, and one not devoid of humour, was in circulationfor misery, too, will sometimes make people witty -</p><p>" I have bestowed one plague, and received an-,f, other." But Marius was accused by only one city puwcty, *^^' \ and by a number of private individuals ; whereas Classicus was attacked by a whole province. The prosecution was anticipated by his death, which was either casual or the result , of his own act ; for though it was unfavourably spoken of it remained a matter of doubt. Indeed, while it seemed likely that he should have wished to lay down his life since he could offer no defence, it seemed equally strange that a man should, by death, have escaped the shame of being condemned, who had felt no shame in com- mitting actions worthy of condemnation. None the less did the Bsetici persist in accusing him, even after he was deceased.</p><p>There was a legal provision to this effect, though it had fallen into disuse, and after a long interval it was again applied in this case. They went still further, BOOK III.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zi</head><p>and included in the accusation the accomplices and agents of Classicus, demanding an inquiry into their conduct and giving their names.</p><p>I appeared for the Bsetici, and with me was Lucceius Albinus, a fluent and graceful speaker, a man for whom I had long felt a regard that was mutual, and towards whom, owing to our association in this affair, I have begun to cherish an ardent affection. Glory carries with it, espe- cially in mental pursuits, a certain " unsociableness ; " * yet between us there was no conflict, no contention, each exerting himself as an equal yoke-fellow, not on his own behalf, but on that of the cause, whose importance and interests seemed to demand that we should not take upon us to deal with so weighty a matter in a single speech a-piece.</p><p>We feared that daylight, that our voices, that our strength might fail us, if we tied up so many charges, so many accused persons, in one bundle as it were. Further, that the attention of the judges might be not only weakened but' actually confused by the multitude of names and cases.</p><p>Again, that the interests possessed by individuals, when thus conjoined in a lump, might lead to each indi- vidual obtaining the advantage of the whole. Lastly, that the most influential personages, by offering up the meanest of the lot as a kind of scapegoat, might slip off under cover of other folks' punishment. For assuredly favour and in- trigue are most certairi to prevail when they can shelter themselves under a specious appearance of severity. We remembered the example given by Sertorius, who ordered the strongest and the weakest soldier to pull at the tail of a horseyou know the rest ; for we, too, saw that so numerous an array of accused could only be got the better of, on condition of being attacked singly.</p><p>We determined to start with proving the guilt of Classicus himself ; from this the transition was most natural to his accomplices and agents, since they could not be proved to be such, unless he, were guilty.</p><p>Of this * ^AkOIVUV7]TOV, number, we at once tacked on two to Classicns, Bsebins Probus and Fabius Hispanus, both strong men in point of interest, Hispanus also in point of eloquence. As to Classicus, indeed, our work was short and easy. He had left in writings under his own hand, what he had received from every transaction and from every cause ; he had even ^jj^v sent letters to Eome'to a certain mistress of his, boasting and bragging in these very words, " Hurrah ! hurrah ! I come to you a free * man, having already realised four millions of sesterces,t by a sale of a portion of the Bsetici."! With regard to. Hispanus and Probus, we had a great deal of trouble.</p><p>Before entering upon their crimes, I thought it necessary to labour the point of demonstrating that agency "was a criminal offence, since if I had not estab- lished this it w.ould have been useless to prove that they were agents ; for, the defence set up for them was, not a denial of the charges, but a plea for allowance on the ground of compulsion. They were provincials, they said, and were compelled by fear to obey all the proconsul's orders.</p><p>Claudius Eestitutus, who replied to me, a prac- ticed and wary advocate, and one who is prepared for every emergency, however unexpected, constantly says that never in his life was he so mystified and perplexed as when he saw his defence forestalled and robbed of the very points on which he placed all his reliance. The result of our joint conduct of the case was this : the senate decided that the property possessed by Classicus, before going to his province, should be separated from the remainder and be handed over to his daughter ; the rest to go to those who had been despoiled. It was further added that the monies he had paid his creditors should be refunded by them. His- panus and Probus were banished for five years. So serious did those crimes of theirs appear, about which at the outset doubts were entertained whether they were crimes at all. BOOK III.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>89</head><p>After a few days, we put in accusation Cluvius Fuscus, a son-in-law of Classicus, and Stilonius Prisons, who had been tribune of a cohort under Classicus, with different results, Priscus being banished * from Italy for two years, and Puscus acqiiitted. In our third suit, we thought it the most convenient course to proceed against several persons collectively, lest, if the inquiry were further pro- tracted, the impartiality and strictness of the judges might become relaxed through satiety and disgust as it were.</p><p>And, besides, there remained certain less important defen- dants who had been expressly reserved for this stage, with the exception, however, of Classicus's wife, as to whom, though she was involved in suspicions, yet it was thought there were not enough proofs to convict her. Por with regard to Classicus's daughter, who was also among the defendants, not even suspicions attached to her. So on coming to her name in the last suit (for towards the end of the proceedings we had not to fear, as we should have done at the beginning, that such a course might weaken the force of the entire accusation), I deemed it the most honourable plan not to press on an innocent person, and I said this frankly and in various ways. On one occasion I asked the agents of the province whether they could furnish me with any instructions such as they were confident could be confirmed by proofs; another time I re- quested the advice of the senate whether, supposing me to possess some powers of oratory, they were of opinion that I ought to aim a kind of weapon, so to speak, at the throat of an innocent person. In the end, I summed up the whole subject in these concluding words : " Some one will perhaps say, ' Do you, then, constitute yourself a judge ? ' I, indeed, am not judging ; but I remember that I was assigned as an advocate from among those who are judges."</p><p>The end of this cause, to which so many persons were parties, was that some were acquitted, and a greater number convicted and further banished, either for a term or for life.</p><p>By the same decree of the senate, onr assiduity and- integrity and intrepidity were attested with the fullest acknowledgments, a meet reward of our great exertions, and the only one that could compensate for them. You can imagine how tired we are, after having had to speak so often, and so often to altercate,* to interrogate, to come to the rescue of, to refute such a number of witnesses. Then see how difficult and jtroublesome it was merely to turn a deaf ear to the private solicitations of the defendants' friends, and to bear up against their open opposition. I will just relate one thing of those I said. On one of the judges interrupting me with a reclamation on behalf of a defendant, who enjoyed great interest, " The man," said I, " will be none the less innocent if I say all I have to say." t You will conjecture from this what controversies, what angry feelings even, we had to put up with, at any rate for a short time.</p><p>For integrity, though at the actual time it offends those to whose wishes it is opposed, yet in the sequel is honoured and praised by these identical people, I have introduced you to the scene to the best of my ability.</p><p>You will say, " It was not worth while. What have I to do with such a long letter?" Well, then, don't you keep asking what is going on in. Eome. And yet remember that a letter is not a long one which embraces so many days and trials, so many defendants in short, and so many cases ; all of which I fancy I have set forth as concisely as carefully.</p><p>Yet I was hasty in saying " carefully ;</p><p>" something occurs to me which I had passed over, and that, too, somewhat late. Nevertheless, though out * We have no word for altercor.</p><p>f This is taken in two ways.

Homer does this kind of thing, and a good many others on the strength of his ex- ample, and it is mighty graceful in other ways. However, it is not on these accounts that I do it.</p><p>One of the witnesses, either angry at having been sub- pcena'd against his will, or else suborned by one or other of the defendants with the view of disarming the accusa- tion, impeached Norbanus Licinianus, an agent of the j)rovince and solicitor for the prosecution, on a charge of collusion in the case of Casta (this was the wife of Classicus).</p><p>It is a maxim of our law that the case of the person on trial shall first be completed, and then the ques- tion of collusion be inquired into ; evidently because the honesty of a prosecutor is best judged of from the course of the prosecution itself.</p><p>In the instance of Norbanus, however, neither the order prescribed by law, nor the name of agent and office of solicitor, were any protection to him : such a blaze of odium enveloped the man, who, be- sides being otherwise infamous, had made his profit, as many did,, out of Domitian's times, and who had been selected onjiihis occasion by the province as their solicitor, not for his .respectability and integrity, but for his enmity to Classicus, by whom he had been banished. He requested t&lt;;jf^fcave a day named for the inquiry, and that the charges a^nst him should be formulated ; but he obtained neither request, and was compelled to reply on the spot. He did reply,the bad, vicious character of the man makes me doubt whether I should say with impudence, or with firmness, certainly with great readiness. Many charges were brought against him which did him more harm than that of collusion. Moreover, two men of consular rank, Pomponius Eufus and Libo Frugi, damaged him by their evidence to the effect that he had assisted the accusers of Salvius Liberalis in open court in Domitian's time. He was found guilty and banished to an island. So, when I came to prosecute Casta, there was no point which I pressed more than this one, that her accuser had been con-victed of collusion.</p><p>However, I pressed it to no purpose, for a result followed which was self-contradictory and novel ; the accuser having been found guilty of collusion, the defendant was acquitted.</p><p>You ask what we did during this affair of Norbanus.* We submitted to the senate that we had been instructed by him in the matter of the state trial, and that we ought to be furnished with an entirely fresh set of instructions if he were proved to have acted in collusion ; accordingly, while his case was being proceeded with, we remained in our seats. After this, Norbanus was present each day at the principal trial and persevered with the same resolution, or else im- pudence, to the very end.</p><p>I ask myself whether I have again omitted anything, and again an omission has nearly occurred. On the last day, Salvius Liberalis strongly inveighed against the re- maining agents, on the ground that they had not brought to trial all those whom the province had charged them to prosecute ; and by his usual force and eloquence he in- volved them in some risk. I came to the aid of these men, who are not only very worthy but also very grateful persons ; at any rate they say publicly that they owe their escape from such a storm to me.

Besides, I feared to upset you, in the midst of festal days, by leading you back to a remem- brance of your poignant sorrow. Even now, there is some hesitation on my part whether to forward you, at your particular request, that portion only which was recited by me, or to ad,d to it what I meditate reserving for a fresh volume.

To be sure, after the banishment of the philosophers from Eome,* I went to see him at his house in the suburbs, and what made the thing more subject to remark, in other words more dangerous, was the fact that I was praetor at the time. Moreover, I advanced to him without interest (though I had to borrow it myself) a considerable sum of money, which he required for the purpose of discharging debts contracted by him under the most honourable circumstanceswhile some of his great and wealthy friends were hemming and hawing over it. And this I did when seven of my friends had been either put to death or banished -Senecio, Eusticus and Helvidius had been put to death ; Mauricus, Gratilla, Arria and Fannia had been banishedand when scorched, as it were, by so many thunderbolts falling around me, I augured from certain sure signs that the same destruction was impend- ing over myself. Yet I do not on this account consider that I deserved any extraordinary credit, as he sets forth, but simply that I avoided disgracing myself; for not only did C. Musonius, his father-in-law, inspire me with a regard mingled with admiration {as far as difference of ages permitted), but this very Artemidorus was cherished by me in the closest bonds of friendship, as long ago as when I was soldiering in Syria, in the capacity of tribune.</p><p>And the first token of some good natural disposition that I showed was the fact that I was seen to appreciate a man, who was either a sage or else approximated to and closely resembled one ; for of all those who now-a-days style themselves philosophers, you will hardly find here and there one so thoroughly honest and genuine. I say nothing of the bodily endurance with which he bears the cold of winter equally with the heat of summer, or of how he recoils before no exertions, how neither in his food nor in his drink does he allow any part to sensual enjoyment, how he is master of his eyes and his emotions.

For he relates how those whom Cato encountered, when they had uncovered his tipsy head, blushed, adding, " You would think, noit that Cato had been caught in the act by them, but they by Cato."

He was bathing at his villa near Formiae, when all of a sudden his slaves surrounded him : one sprang at his throat, another struck him on the face, a third inflicted blows on his chest and belly, and even, horrible to relate, on other parts of his frame. When they thought the breath was out of him, they threw him on the hot pavement, to ascertain whether he was still alive.</p><p>On seeing him extended without motioneither because he was really senseless, or else pretended to be sothey were satisfied that they had done for him. Then, at last, they carried him out, under pretence that he had been suffocated by the heat. His more confidential servants received the body, and his mistresses ran up with wailings and shrieks. Whereupon, roused by the sound of voices, and refreshed by the coolness of the place, he showed that he was alivehe could do it safely now -by opening his eyes and by the movements of his body. The slaves fled, of whom the greater number have been arrested, and the re- mainder are being searched for. He himself, having been nursed with difficulty for some days, died, not without the satisfaction of seeing them punished, for he was avenged during his lifetime as persons usually are after they have been slain.</p><p>You see to what a number of dangers and affronts and mockeries we are exposed ; nor has any one reason to feel secure on the ground of being easy-going and indulgent, for masters are assassinated, not upon a judgment of their conduct, but from sheer wickedness. However, so much for this.</p><p>What is there further in the way of news ? What ? Why nothing, else I would add it ; for there is still room left on my paper, and moreover to-day, being a holiday, would allow of my stringing together more matter, I will just add what opportunely occurs to me in relation G to this same Macedo. As he was once bathing at the public baths in Eome, a remarkable, and indeed, as the event showed, ominous circumstance occurred to him. A Roman knight, whom Macedo's slave had requested, by a slight touch of the hand, to allow him to pass, turned round and struck with his open palm, not the slave by whom he had been touched, but Macedo himself, with such force that he nearly knocked him down. So the bath, as it were, by a kind of gradation, was first a scene of affront and after- wards of death to him.</p><p>(IS.)</p><p>To SiLius Proculus.</p><p>You ask me to read your short productions in the retirement of the country, and to examine whether they are worth publishing. You employ prayers and you allege an authority ; for while you beg me to subtract some odd hours from my literary pursuits and bestow them on yours, you add that M.

I seem to have observed, with regard to the actions and utterances of distinguished men and women, that the most famous are not always the greatest.* This opinion of mine has been confirmed by what I heard from Fannia yesterday.</p><p>The lady is a granddaughter of the celebrated Arria, who was not only the solace of her husband in death, but herself set him the example of dying. She related many traits of her grandmother, not inferior to this action, though less known ; and I am of opinion that they will appear as admirable to you when you read of them as they did to me on hearing of them.</p><p>Csecina Psetus, her husband, lay sick, and her son lay sick too, both of them, as it seemed, to the death. The son died, a youth of remarkable beauty, and as modest as he was beautiful, one not less endeared to his parents by other considerations, than by the fact of his being their son.</p><p>She made arrangements for his funeral, and con- ducted his obsequies in such a way that her husband knew nothing of the matter. Nay more, whenever she entered his bed-room, she pretended that their son still lived, and even that he was somewhat easier, and upon his frequently inquiring what the boy was doing she would answer, " He has had a good sleep. He has taken food with appetite." After ^this, as her tears, long restrained, were getting the better of her and breaking forth, she would leave the room. Then she abandoned herself to her grief.</p><p>When she had -^vept her full she would return, her eyes dried, her features composed, as though she had left * A lia clariora esse alia majora, literally, " that some are more celebrated and others greater." her condition of bereavement outside the door. Glorious, indeed, was tlie conduct of tliis same lady when she drew the steel and plunged it into her bosom and, extracting the dagger and handing it to her husband, added those immortal and well-nigh divine words, " Paetus, it gives no pain ! " And yet, when she acted and spoke thus, glory and enduring fame were before her eyes. How much nobler a thing it was, with no prize of enduring fame or of glory in view, to hide her tears, to veil her grief, to go on playing the part of mother when her son was gone ! Scribonianus had taken up arms against Claudius in Illyricum.</p><p>Psetus had sided with him, and (Scribonianus having been killed) was being dragged a prisoner to Eome.</p><p>He was about to embark on board ship, when Arria en- treated the soldiers that she might be allowed to embark with him. " Surely," said she, " you are going to allow a man of consular rank some servant-lads to hand him his food, to help him on with his clothes and his shoes ! / will do everything for him single-handed."</p><p>Failing to obtain her request, she hired a fishing-smack, and followed the huge vessel in her tiny craft. The same lady said to the wife of Scribonianus, who had turned informer, upon the hearing before Claudius, " Can I listen to you when Scribonianus was killed on your bosom, and yet you live ! " from which it is plain that the design of her glorious death was no sudden one.</p><p>More than this, when Thrasea, her son-in-law, adjured her not to persist in putting an end to her life, and among other things said, " Is it your wish, then, that your daugh- ter, if ever I should be compelled to die, should die with me ? " she replied, " If she shall have lived as long and as united a life with you, as I with Paetus, it is my wish."</p><p>This reply increased the anxiety of her friends, and she was watched more closely than before. Perceiving this, " You are wasting your time," said she ; " you can, indeed, bring it to pass that I shall die with difficulty, but not that I shall fail to die."</p><p>In the act of speaking, she BOOK III. loi sprang from her seat and struck her head with great force full against the opposite wall, falling to the ground. " I told you," said she, when she had been brought round by treat- ment, " that I should find some way, however hard, to death, if you denied me an easy one." Do not these things seem to you grander than the celebrated " Psetus, it gives no pain ! " for which they prepared the way ? And yet, for all that, one action enjoys great celebrity, and the others none at all. Hence may be gathered, as I started by say- ing, that what is most famous is not always the greatest.</p><p>(17.)</p><p>To Servianus.</p><p>Can all be well, that your letters have ceased for some time past ? Or perhaps all is well, but you are busy ? Or you are not busy, but you have few or no opportunities of communicating with me ? Eelieve me of this uneasiness which is too much for me : pray relieve me of it, even at the cost of sending a special messenger. I will pay him his expenses and make him a present into the bargain, provided only he brings me the news I long for. For my- self, I am well, if one can be said to be well who lives in suspense and anxiety, hourly expecting and dreading on the account of his loved friend every possible accident which can befall man.</p><p>(i8.) To CuRius Severus.</p><p>My office of consul imposed on me the duty of con- gratulating the Emperor in the name of the State. Hav- ing done this, according to custom, in the Senate, in a way suitable to the time and place, I deemed it most agreeable to the part of a good citizen, to embrace the same subject at greater length, and with a fuller treatment, in a published volume : firstly, that our Emperor might be I02 PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>gratified by the exhibition of his own virtues set forth with genuine praises ; secondly, that future princes might be admonished beforehandnot in schoolmaster fashion, but at least by an exampleof the best road for attaining to the same renown. For to teach what a prince ought to be, though to be sure a noble work, is at the same time an arduous and almost a presumptuous one. Whereas, to praise an admirable prince, and in this way to exhibit to posterity a light, so to speak, from a beacon, such as it may followthis course has the same advantages as the other, without any air of assumption.</p><p>Again, it was no small pleasure to me that when I desired to read this book to my friends, and had bidden them, not by formal cards or handbills, but simply, " if it were convenient," "if they had plenty of time to spare," (and never, in Eome, do people have plenty of spare time, or is it convenient to them to listen to a reading), yet they assembled, in the worst possible weather too, for two consecvitive days, and when my modesty was for bringing the reading to an end, insisted on my adding a third day. Am I to suppose that this honour was paid to me, or to letters ?</p><p>To letters, I am sure, which once nearly extinct, are now being warmed into life again. But look at the subject to which they paid such devoted attention ! Why, it was one which, in the Senate itself, where we were obliged to put up with it, nevertheless used to weary us even in the shortest space of time ; yet now persons are found ready to read out and to listen to this same subject for three whole days, not because it is treated with more eloquence than formerly, but because it is treated with greater freedom and consequently with greater heartiness. This then must be added to the praises of our Prince, that a business which was once as hateful as it was untruthful * has become as agreeable as it is genuine.</p><p>I must say, however, that I was wonderfully pleased not only with the attention of my audience, but also with * He alludes in this, and what has preceded, to the bad days of Domitian.</p><p>BOOK TIL 103 their taste.</p><p>For I noticed that the gravest passages were those which were most highly approved by them. I am of course aware that I recited to a small mimber of persons only, what had been written for the general public. None the less, for all that, and just as though the opinion of the public is sure to be the same, I am rejoiced at this severity of taste in the listener, and just as theatrical audiences used to teach the musicians to play badly, so now I am induced to hope that possibly these same audiences may teach them to play well* For all who write to please will write what they see docs please. As to myself, how- ever, I am confident that, in this particular kind of subject, I am justified in employing a somewhat lively style, inas- much as those portions which are plain and devoid of colouring, rather than those which have been penned with gaiety and a certain exuberance, might seem foreign to, and out of keeping with it. Yet none the less earnestly do I pray that there may be a time somewhen (and I hope it may have come already), when the sugared and flatter- ing style will be driven even from ground to which it may seem fairly entitled, in favour of what is serious and severe.</p><p>You have my doings for three days : I wished you to hear of them, and thus to receive the same pleasure in your absenceboth on account of letters generally and myself personallyas you might have enjoyed had you been present.</p><p>(19.)</p><p>To Calvisius Rufus.</p><p>I call you as usual into council on my private affairs. Certain farms are for sale, which adjoin my estate and in- deed run into it. In these there are many points which attract me, and some of no less importance which repel me. What attracts me is, first of all, that it would be a * This is said figuratively. The reference is still to written compositions and recitations. fine thing in itself to join the two properties, next that it would be a source of advantage no less than of pleasure to be able to visit both of them at the same time and at the expense of one journey, to place them under the same stewards, one may almost say under the same overseers, and while inhabiting and embellishing one house, merely to have to keep the other one in repair. As elements in .this calculation there are the cost of furniture, the charges of head-servants, gardeners, workmen, and hunting equi- page as well : since it makes a great difference whether these objects are collected in one spot or dispersed about in various places.</p><p>On the other hand, I fear it may be imprudent to expose such an amount of property to the same climate and the same casualties. It seems safer to test the mutability of fortune by varying the situation of one's possessions.</p><p>Besides, there is much that is agreeable in the chancre of scene and of climate, and in the mere travelling about from one property to another. Now the chief point on which I am deliberating is this ; the lands are fertile, rich and well-watered, they consist of meadows, vineyards, and woods which furnish timber, and_Jience a revenue which, though moderate in amount, is sure.* But this fruitfulness of the soil is deteriorated by the poverty of those who cultivate it. For the former owner used often to distrain on the tenant's stock, and while dimi- nishing for a time the arrears due from his farmers, he drained them of their resources for the future, and owing to the failure of these, the arrears grew up again.</p><p>Hence these people must be furnished with slaves, who will cost all the more because they must be honest ones. For as to slaves in chains, I have none such anywhere, nor has any one in those parts. It remains to let you know the price at which it seems the property can be bought : three millions of sesterces,f not but what it was at one time five milKons, f but owing to this miserable BOOK III. io8 state of the farmers and the generally unfavourable times, the income from the land has gone back and the price with it. You will ask whether I can easily raise even this sum of three millions ? True, nearly the whole of my property is in land, yet I have some money out at interest, and it will not be difficult for me to borrow. My mother- in-law will accommodate me, whose cash-box is as much at my service as my own. Accordingly do not let this in- fluence you, if the remaining considerations are not in the way, all of which I would beg you to examine with the utmost care. For as in all other matters, so in the dis- posal of property, you are rich in experience and in judgment. Now, however, in the Senate, this same practice has been approved as the best, without any difference of opi- nion.</p><p>Every one, on the day of the Comitia, called for tablets.</p><p>In truth, with our system of undisguised and open voting, we had come to exceed the licence of public meetings.</p><p>No order in speaking, no silent reserve, not even the decorum of remaining seated, was attended to. In all directions there were loud and discordant clamours ; every one rushed forward with his own candidate ; there were a number of groups in the middle of the chamber, and a number of rings formed, and an unseemly confu- sion.</p><p>To such an extent had we degenerated from the usage of our ancestors, in whose times everything was so carefully ordered and regulated and calmly conducted, as to preserve the majesty and reverence of the place. There are old men still living who tell me that the order of the Comitia was as follows : -The candidate was summoned io6 PLINY'S LETTERS. by name, upon which there was a dead silence. He spoke for himself, set forth his life, gave the names of his refer- ences and backers, either that of the officer under whom lie had served in the army, or else of the magistrate whose quaestor he had been, or of both, if he were able, to which he added those of some of his supporters. These spoke on his behalf with propriety, and shortly ; and this was of more avail than canvassing.* Sometimes a candidate would take exception to the birth, or the age, or even the char- acter of an opponent. The senate listened with the gra- vity of a censor.</p><p>Hence merit generally prevailed over interest. Now that these usages have been corrupted by extravagant favouritism, recourse has been had to secret voting as a kind of remedy. And a remedy, for the time, it certainly was, being something quite new and unex- pected.</p><p>But I fear that as time goes on the remedy itself will give birth to evils.</p><p>There is, indeed, a danger that a contempt for honesty may steal into this silent voting : for how few there are who have the same rescard for their honour in private as they have publicly. Many stand in awe of public opinion, few of their own consciences. However, it is too soon to talk of what lies in the future ; for the present, by favour of the ballot, we shall have the magistrates whose appointment was most desirable.

Eegulus had set the lad free from parental control, in order that he might be constituted heir to his mother, and having thus " sold "t him (so it was styled in common talk derived from the character of the man) proceeded to toady him under a disgusting and unparental pretence of indulging him. The thing seems incredible, but then remember Eegulus ! However, he mourns his son's loss like a madman. The boy had a number of ponies for harness and saddle ; he had dogs large and small, nightingales, parrots, and black- birds, all of which Eegulus slaughtered at the funeral pile.</p><p>This was not grief, but the ostentation of grief. He is visited by a wonderful number of people, by all of whom he is abominated and detested ; yet just as though they esteemed and had a regard for him, they hurry to attend on him, and, to state shortly my opinion, in gaining the good graces of Eegulus, they make themselves like him.</p><p>He keeps to his gardens on the other side of the Tiber, where he has covered a large space of ground with vast colonnades, as also the bank of the river with statues of himself.</p><p>So lavish is he, with all his consummate avarice, and so vainglorious in the midst of his consummate infamy.

At the same time he is very closely connected with C. Calvisius, my old crony and your friend, being indeed his sister's son. I beg that you will add to his lustre, both in his own and his maternal uncle's eyes, by conferring on him a tribuneship for six months. You will oblige me, you will oblige our friend Calvisius, you will oblige Nepos himself, who will prove a debtor no less to your mind than you esteem us to be.</p><p>You have conferred many favours on many people, yet I venture to contend that there is none which you will have invested to greater advantage, and only one here and there so well.</p><p>(50</p><p>To Spaesus.</p><p>They relate that ^^schines, at the request of the Eho- dians, recited an oration of his own, and afterwards one by Demosthenes, each of them amid loud applause.

Whether this approval was deserved or not you will learn when you have read the speech itself, the extent of which does not permit me to preface it by a more protracted letter. For lure, certainly, where brevity is possible, I ought to be brief, so that the speech itself may find the more excuse for its length, though it is not lengthened beyond the importance of its theme, (6.)</p><p>To Julius Naso.</p><p>My Tuscan produce has been swept off by the hail.

For there I write a great deal, and improve, not the land (which I have not got), but myself by means of study ; and just as in other places I can show you a full barn, so here I can actually show you a full escritoire.* Do you, too, then, if you are anxious for an estate with a safe income and fertile soil, provide yourself with some- thing on this coast.</p><p>"o (7.)</p><p>To Catius Lepidus.</p><p>I often tell you that there is energy f in Eegulus.

However, he read it out ; and this same book, after it had been transcribed into a thousand copies, he distributed throughout the whole of Italy and the provinces, with public instructions in writing, to the effect that the Decurions* should choose one out of their own number, with the best voice, to read it to the people.</p><p>Tliis was done accordingly. If he had only directed to better purposes this energy of his (or by whatever other name we are to call the determination to obtain all one's ends), how much good he might have effected ! Though, to be sure, there is less energy in good than in bad men, and just as " resolution is engendered by ignorance and hesitation by reflection," f so honest natures are enfeebled by their modesty, while perverse ones are encouraged by their effrontery.</p><p>Eegulus is an example of this. He has weak lungs, a confused utterance, a faltering delivery, the slowest faculty of imagination, no memory at all ; nothing, in short, beyond his wild capacity, and yet through his impudence and this very frantic power of his he has got to the point of being esteemed an orator. Hence Herennius Senecio applied to him admirably the converse of you yourself, perhaps, have read out, like a cheap-jack in the forum, this doleful production of Eegulus ; " raising your voice," to wit, as Demosthenes has it, " and full of glee, and straining your windpipe."

You are warranted in your congratula- tions, first of all, because it is a great thing to win the deliberate approval of a most exemplary prince even where the matter is a small one ; next, because the priestly office is not only by nature an ancient one connected with re- ligion, but is moreover rendered completely sacred and exceptional in this respect that it cannot be taken from the holder during his lifetime. For other offices, though almost on a par with this in point of dignity, as they are conferred, so in like manner they can be taken away. In regard to this one, the power of Fortune does not go be- yond the matter of granting it. Moreover, to me it seems an additional cause of conOTatulation that I have succeeded Julius Frontinus, a man of great mark, who on the day of nomination for these several past years in succession used to propose me for the priesthood, as though adopting me into his place, an act which now the event has approved in such a way that it cannot seem to have been fortuitous.</p><p>You, however, as you write, are chiefly delighted at my being augur because M. TuUius* was one. You are re- joiced, that is, at my stepping into the honours of one whom I long to emulate in my intellectual pursuits. But oh that, as like him I have obtained the priestly office and the consulship, and indeed at a much earlier time of life than his, so also, in old age at any rate, I might attain to some share of his mental powers ! Yet, to be sure, what is in the power of man falls to my lot as well as to that of many others. But in proportion as it is difficult to acquire, so is it too much even to hope for gifts which lie in the hands of the gods alone.</p><p>(9.)</p><p>To Cornelius Uesus.</p><p>Julius Bassus has been upon his defence during the last few days, a man who has seen much trouble, and one cele- brated for his misfortunes. He was accused under Vespa- sian by two persons in a private station, then sent before the Senate, where he remained long in suspense, at last acquitted and discharged. He stood in fear of Titus, as being a friend of Domitian's, and by Domitian himself he was banished. Eecalled by Xerva, he had the province of Bithynia allotted to him, and returned thence under im- peachment, being as eagerly prosecuted as he was faithfully defended.</p><p>He encountered various judgments in the Senate, most of them, however, taking a lenient view.</p><p>Pomponius Eufus appeared for the prosecution, a ready and powerful speaker. He was followed by Theophanes, one of the ^Drovincial agents, the firebrand and originator of the accusation.</p><p>I replied.</p><p>For Bassus had charged me to establish the groundwork of his entire defence ; to speak of his distinctions, which, from the splendour of his family and the actual perils he had undergone, were great; of the conspiracy of the informers against him, which they were working for their own profit; of the causes of his having given offence to the most factious fellows, such as this very Theophanes. He had wished me at the same time to advance and meet the charcre which pressed him most closely. Eor, as to other charges, how- ever serious they might sound, he deserved not merely ac- quittal, but even praise. What weighed on him was thisthat, being a simple and unsuspecting man, he had accepted BOOK IV, 117 certain gifts from the provincials in the character of their friend, for he had once been Quaestor in the same province. These, his accusers termed plunder and rapine : lie-termed them presents. But the law forbids even presents being accepted.</p><p>Hereupon, what was I to do, what course of defence was I to enter upon ? Should I traverse the fact ? I was apprehensive that it would appear plainly to be " plunder " from my being afraid to admit it. Moreover, to deny a matter that was clear would be to act so as to augment the gravity of the accusation, instead of impairing it, particularly where the defendant himself had left no option to his counsel. For he had told a number of people, and even the Emperor, that he had accepted these " little presents " alone (and sent many of the same kind) merely on the occasion of his birthday, or during the Saturnalia.</p><p>Should I implore pardon for him then ? It would be cutting the defendant's throat to concede that he had erred in such a way that he could only be saved by a pardon. Should I defend the act as a legitimate one ? I should have done him no good, and should only have exhibited my own effrontery. In this strait I determined to preserve a land of middle course, and I seem to have succeeded. My speech, as in the case of battles, was stopped by nightfall. I had spoken for three hours and a half : one hour and a half remained to me. For since, in accordance with law, the prosecutor had been granted six hours, and the defendant nine, the latter had so divided the time between me and the counsel who was to follow me, that I could employ five hours and he the remainder. But the success of my speech prompted me to say no more and to make an end of it.</p><p>For it is rash not to be satisfied with what has gone off well.</p><p>Besides, I feared that my bodily strength might fail me for a renewed effort, it being more difficult to resume than to continue without a break. There was danger, too, that the rest of my speech might suffer a chill as a thing that had been put by, and might prove tedious as a thing brought out afresh. For, just as torches preserve Il8 PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>their fire by being constantly shaken, and renew it with great difficulty when it has been once let down, so the warmth of the speaker and the attention of the hearer are kept up by continuity, and are weakened by intermission and, if I may so speak, relaxation.</p><p>However, Bassus, with many prayers and almost tears, begged me to complete my time ; so I complied, preferring his interests to my own. Success attended me: the minds of the Senate were so attentive and so fresh that they seemed to be whetted rather than satisfied by my previous speech. Lucceius Albinus followed me, so appo- sitely that our speeches might be thought to unite the variety of two, with the consistency of a single oration, Herennius made a spirited and weighty reply, then came Theophanes again. For here too, as usual, he behaved with consummate impudence, in that, after two speakers, men of consular rank as well as of eloquence, he claimed further time for himself, and that, too, pretty freely. He spoke till nightfall and even after nightfall, lights having been brought in. The next day, Homullus and Fronto spoke admirably for Bassus, and the fourth day was occupied by the examination of proofs, Bsebius Macer, Consul-Elect, gave it as his opinion that Bassus had sub- jected himself to the law against bribery and extortion;</p><p>Csepio Hispo, that he should retain his Senatorial rank, and have judges assigned him.* Both of them were in the right.</p><p>How can that be, you ask, when they gave such opposite opinions ? Why, because Macer, looking to the law, was quite consistent in condemning one who had accepted presents contrary to law ; and Csepio, deeming that the Senate has the power, as certainly it has, to mitigate the force of laws as well as to construe them strictly, was not without reason in extending a pardon to acts which, though forbidden, are not unfrequently practised.</p><p>The opinion of Cijepio prevailed : nay more, when</p><p>he rose to state it, he was cheered as Senators usually are * See ii. ii, note. BOOK IV. 119 on resuming their seats : from this, you may judge what approval greeted what he dul say, when such favour was shown to what it was supposed that he would say.</p><p>However, not only in the Senate but also in the city, there are two divisions of opinion. For, those who approve the proposal of Csepio find fault with that of Macer as being too harsh and severe : while those who go with Macer, style the former a lax and indeed an inconsistent proposal : for they say that it is not consistent to retain a man in the Senate to whom judges have been assigned.</p><p>There was also a third proposition : Valerius Paulinus, agreeing with Ctepio, was for adding to the motion, that Theophanes be proceeded against at the termination of his agency.</p><p>For he was charged with having done many acts in the course of the prosecution which were infringements of the very law in virtue of which he had accused Bassus. But this motion, greatly as it approved itself to a large majority of the Senate, was not acted on by the Consuls. However, Paulinus obtained credit for his honesty and courage.</p><p>On the adjournment of the Senate, Bassus was welcomed by a large concourse, and with great shouting and joy. He had been made popular by this revival of the old tradition of his troubles, by his name known through the perils with which it was connected, by his advanced age with its dejection and squalor * united to a stately figure. Take this interim letter as an avant-courier, and look out for my oration in full, and charged with matter : you will, however, have to look out for it for a good long time : for it will have to be retouched, considering the importance of the subject, with no light or superficial hand.</p><p>(10.)</p><p>To Statius Sabinus.</p><p>You write me word that Sabina, who has left us her heirs, though she has nowhere directed that Modestus her * The squalid appearance affected by accused persons.</p></div>

You ask for my view. I have consulted legal authorities ; all are of the same opinion, that he cannot claim his liberty, because it has not been granted him, nor again his legacy, because it was given to a slave. But to me this seems a clear case of slip : I am therefore of opinion that we should do, just as if Sabina had directed it, that which certainly she herself thought she had directed. I am confident that you will accede to my judgment, since you are in the habit of observing most religiously the wishes of the departed, which once under- stood will have the force of law for honest heirs. For, with us, honour weighs no less than necessity with others.</p><p>Let the man remain free then, with our consent ; let him enjoy his legacy as though every precaution had been carefully taken.</p><p>Indeed, Sabina lias taken these precau- tions, since she has made a prudent choice of heirs.</p><p>(II.)</p><p>To Cornelius Minicianus.</p><p>Have you heard that Valerius Licinianus is lecturing in Sicily ? I fancy you have not yet heard it, for the news is but recent. This personage of Preetorian rank was lately esteemed among the most eloquent members of the bar ; he has now fallen so low as to have become an exile instead of a senator, a teacher of rhetoric instead of an orator.</p><p>Hence, he himself, in a prefatory address, ex- claimed in sorrowful and solemn tones, " What sport dost thou make for thyself, oh Fortune ! For thou makest Professors out of Senators, and Senators out of Professors !" a sentiment in which there is so much bile and bitterness, that he seems to me to have turned Professor for the ex- press purpose of uttering it. This same man, when he had made his entrance, clad in a Greek mantle (for those who are interdicted from fire and water * are deprived of the right to wear the toga), after he had settled himself and given an eye to his dress, remarked, " I am going to declaim in Latin V All very sad and pitiful, you will say, but the man deserved it for having polluted this very profession of eloquence by the guilt of incest. To be sure, he confessed to the incest, but it is uncertain whether he did this because it was the fact, or because he feared worse con- sequences if he denied it. Domitian was at that time raging and storming, abandoned to his own resources,f in the midst of the vast odium he had incurred. For wdien he had become bent on burying alive Cornelia, the chief of the Vestal virgins, under the notion that his reign would be illustrated by examples of this kind ; in virtue of his right as Pontifex Maximus, or rather, with the brutality of a tyrant and the licence of a despot, he summoned his colleagues, not to the Pontifical palace, but to his Alban villa. Then, with a wickedness not falUng short of that which he had the air of punishing, he pro- nounced her guilty of incest, in her absence and without hearing her ; he, the very man who had not only incestuously polluted his brother's daughter, but had murdered her into the bargain, for she died of abortion in her widowhood. The Pontifices were despatched forthwith to see to Cornelia's being buried and put an end to. As for her, raising her hands, now to Vesta, now to the rest of the gods, she uttered, among many cries, this one most often, " Does Ccesar deem me, incestuous, who performed the sacred rites when he conquered, when he triumphed ? " Whether she said this with the intention to flatter or else to mock him, whether from confidence in her own virtue or from contempt for the Emperor, is a matter of doubt however, she kept on saying it till she was led to execution, innocent or not I cannot say, but certainly with the ap- pearance of innocence. Moreover, as she was being escorted down to that terrible subterranean dung;eon, her dress catching in the course of her descent, she turned round and disengaged it, and on the executioner offerincr her his hand, she shuddered and started back, rejecting this foul pollution of her person, as though evidently chaste and pure, with a last expression of sanctity, and, exhibiting in all points her modest demeanour, " Took every care to fall with decency." * Moreover, Celer, a Eoman knight, who was charged as the accomplice of Cornelia, had persisted in crying out, while being beaten with rods in the Comitium, " What have I done ? I have done nothing ! " Domitian, then, was raging under a sense of the ill repute of his cruelty and injustice. So he pounced on Licinianus for concealing a freedwoman of Cornelia at his country place. The latter was forewarned by those who had charge of him to take refuge in a confession, as in a means of pardon, if he had not a mind for the Comitia and the rods. This he did. Herennius Senecio spoke for him, in his absence, somewhat after the fashion of the well- known " Patroclus is dead." -f For he said, " Instead of pleading a cause, I have only a message to deliver.</p><p>Licinianus abandons his defence." This was very agree- able to Domitian, so much so that he could not help showing his joy, and saying, " Licinianus clears us." He went so far as to add, " that the culprit's shame should not be pressed too hard," and permitted him, in fact, to carry off anything he could from his effects, before his property was confiscated, granting him an easy place of exile as a kind of premium. Thence, however, he was subsequently * A line from the ' Hecuba ' of concisely as Antilochus did when an-Euripides.</p><p>nouncing to Achilles the death of f I.e., spoke for him as briefly and Patroclus.</p><p>BOOK IV. 123 transferred, "by the clemency of the late Emperor Nerva, to Sicily, where he now gives lectures and revenges him- self on fortune by his prefatory addresses.</p><p>You see the readiness with which I obey you, in that I write to you not only of town affairs, but foreign ones as well, and with such care as to trace them to their source.</p><p>And to be sure I thought that, as you were absent at the time, you had heard nothing further of Licinianus than that he had been banished for incest.

You will love him and commend him still more, when you are made acquainted with a recent action of his.</p><p>When he had gone out to his province as Quaestor, and had lost there a clerk who had been allotted him, before the latter had become entitled to his salary, he felt, and so decided, that the amount which he had received for the purpose of paying the clerk, ought not to remain in his hands. Consequently, on his return, he consulted Csesar, and afterwards, by Caesar's advice, the Senate, as to what they would have done with the salary. It was a small question; still it xvas a question. The clerk's heirs claimed the amount for themselves, and the heads of the Treasury claimed it for the public. The case was tried. Counsel spoke for the heirs and, after that, for the public : both of them excellently well. Csecilius Strabo moved that the money should be paid into the Treasury ; Bsebius Macer that it should be handed to the heirs.</p><p>Strabo prevailed. Do you give all credit to Mar- cellinus, as I did on the spot. For, though it be abundantly sufficient for him to be approved both by the Prince and the Senate, yet he will rejoice in your testimony. All those indeed who are led by glory and fame are marvel- lously pleased with approval and praise, even when these proceed from their inferiors : whereas, in your case, Marcellinus holds you in such respect that he attributes the greatest weight to your judgment. Add to this that if he shall learn of this action of his penetrating as far as you, he will necessarily be delighted with the reach and the progress and the wide sweep of his repute. Since, I know not how it is, but men are still more pleased by an ex- tended than by a great reputation.</p><p>(13-)</p><p>To Cornelius Tacitus.</p><p>I am glad you have arrived in town safely : and if ever before now your arrival has been looked for by me, it has been particularly so on the present occasion. I myself shall remain yet a few days at my Tusculan place, in order to complete a literary trifle now on hand. For I fear that if my ardour were relaxed just as the work approaches completion, it would with difficulty be re- sumed.</p><p>Meanwhile, to satisfy my impatience, what I shall ask of you when we meet, I now request in this letter which is, so to speak, my avant-courier. But first let me tell you the reasons for my request.</p><p>In the course of a recent visit to my native parts, a youth, the son of one of my townsmen, came to pay Jbis respects to me. To whom -" Are you studying ? " said I.</p><p>"Certainly," he answered. "Wliere?" "At Milan." "Why not here ? " Said his father (for he was with the boy, and indeed had himself brought him), " Because we have no teachers here." " Why have you none ? Surely, it would BOOK IV. 125 be greatly to the interest of you who are fathers,"and very opportunely there were several fathers within hearing -" that your children should be instructed here rather than anywhere else.</p><p>Where indeed could they spend their time more pleasantly than in their own neighbourhood, or be subject to more virtuous supervision than under the eyes of their parents, or be at smaller cost than at home ? How easy it would be then to unite in subscribing for the purpose of engaging teachers, and to add what is now spent on lodgings, on travelling-expenses, on all those things which have to be purchased away from home (and everything has to be purchased away from home) to the salaries devoted to them. Nay, further, I who have as yet no children, am prepared on behalf of our common- wealth, as though she were a daughter or a parent, to contribute a third part of whatever you shall determine to subscribe.</p><p>I would even promise the whole amount, were it not for the fear that such a gift might one day be perverted by means of jobbery, as I see happens in many places where teachers are engaged at the public expense. This abuse can only be met by one remedy, and that is, that the right of making these engagements should be left to the parents alone, and that the conscientious care of deciding rightly should be imposed on them by the necessity of subscribing.</p><p>For those who would perhaps be careless of other people's property, will certainly be careful of their own, and will see to it that none but a deserving person shall receive my money, if he is to receive theirs as well.</p><p>Accordingly, I would have you come to an agreement, and band yourselves together, and derive addi- tional spirit from me, who am desirous that the sum which I shall have to contribute may be as large as possible. You can confer nothing more desirable on your children, or more grateful on your own neighbourhood. Let those who are born here be educated here, and from their very infancy let them grow accustomed to love and to inhabit their native soil. And I pray that you may introduce teachers of such repute that this will be a source to which neighbouring towns will resort for learning, and that, just as now your children flock to other places, so strangers may soon flock to this place."</p><p>I have thought it best to repeat all this in detail, and from its source, so to speak, in order that you might the better understand how agreeable it would be to me if you would undertake my commission. ISTow I commission, and in view of the importance of the matter, entreat you that out of the great number of learned persons who frequent you, from an admiration of your genius, you would look about for some teachers such as we might invite, yet subject to this condition, that I must not be held to pledge myself to any one of them.</p><p>For I reserve complete freedom for the parents ; tlicy must judge, tliey must choose: trouble and expense is all / claim for myself.</p><p>Accordingly, if any one be found who has confidence in his own capacity, let him go there with this understanding, that he takes with him from these parts no assurance, save that which he derives from himself.</p><p>(I4-)</p><p>To Paternus.</p><p>You perhaps, as your way is, are calling for, and indeed expecting an oration from me. But Ias though drawing from some foreign and luxurious waresproduce for you my poetical recreations. You will receive with this letter some hendecasyllables of mine, with which I amuse my leisure hours, when out driving, or in the bath, or at dinner-time.</p><p>In these I jest, disport myself, make love, grieve, complain, am angry, indulge in descriptions, at times in a homely, at others in a more elevated strain, and, by the very variety of treatment, aim at this result, that while different parts may please different people, there may be some parts which will possibly please everybody.</p><p>If, however, some of the number shall appear to you a BOOK IV.   127   trifle too saucy, it will become one of your learning to re- flect that those men of great position and high dignity who have written this kind of thing, have not abstainedto say nothing of frolicsome themesfrom the most naked expressions.</p><p>These last I have avoided, not from my being more austere (how indeed could that be ?) but from my being more timid than they. Besides, I know that the truest law as to these trifles is that which has been ex- pressed by Catullus.</p><p>"</p><p>Though pious poets should themselves be chaste, It does not follow that their strains should be, Which then alone of salt will have a taste, If they be wanton and a trifle free."</p><p>As for me, what an account I make of your judgment, you may estimate e'en from this, that I have preferred that the whole collection should be pondered by you, rather than that selected pieces should meet with your approval.</p><p>And to be sure the happiest pieces would cease to seem such, as soon as they were matched by others of the same sort. Besides, a sensible and critical reader ought not to compare different kinds of productions with each other, but to estimate each production singly, and not to consider as inferior to another piece a piece which is perfect in its own kind. But why add more ? For either to excuse or to commend trifles by a long preface would itself be the height of trifling. There is just one thing which it seems to me ought to be said beforehand, namely, that I think of calling these nugse of mine " Hendecasyllables," a title which refers merely to the metre.</p><p>Accordingly, you may call them, if you like, epigrams or idylls or eclogues, or (as many have it) short poems, or by any other name which you prefer ; / guaran- tee Hendecasyllables only. I ask of your candour that whatever you will say to others of my small book that you will say to me. Nor is what I ask difQcult. For if this little work of mine were either my best or my only one, perhaps it might seem harsh to say " Seek some other occupation ;</p><p>" but in all gentleness and courtesy it might be said, " You liam other occupations."</p><p>(ISO To FUNDANUS.</p><p>If there is anything at all in which I show my judgment, it is certainly in my singular affection for Asinius Eufus. He is an excellent man, and one who has a great regard for all good people. (For why should I not count myself, too, among the good?) This same Ptufus has attached himself to Cornelius Tacitus -and you know what lu ison the closest terms of intimacy. Accordingly, if you hold us both in esteem, needs must be that you have the same opinion of Eufus ; since, for the cementing of friend- ships, the strongest of all ties is to be found in a resemblance of characters.</p><p>He has several children. For in this re- spect, too, he has discharged the office of an admirable citizen, in that he has desired to profit largely by the fruit- fulness of his wife, in an age when the prizes open to a childless condition make even an only son an encumbrance to many.*. Despising such considerations, he has entitled himself to the additional name of grandfather, for he is a grandfather ; and through Saturius Firmus too, whom you will cherish as I do, when you have made as close ac- quaintance with him as I have. All which goes to this, that you may learn how important, how numerous a family you will lay under an obligation by one friendly act ; to ask for which I am led first of all by my wishes, and next by a certain happy omen. For I wish you and also prog- nosticate for you the Consulship next year ; this your own merits and the Prince's opinion of you lead me to augur.</p><p>It would fit in with this, that Asinius Bassus, the eldest of Eufus's children, should be Quaestor in the same year, a * An allusion to the court paid to childless people, with the view of getting a legacy.

It woukl be difficult for you to believe, on my report of one who is absentthough, to be sure, you do believe me in everythingthat he can possess so much industry, probity, learning, intelligence, zeal, and finally memory, as you will find that he does when you have tried him. I only wish our age were so fruitful in good qualities that you would be bound to prefer some others to Bassus ; in that case I should be the first to exhort and admonish you to look around you and indeed debate a long time as to the best ob- ject of your choice. As it is, howeveryet I do not wish to speak in any way presumptuously of my friendat any- rate this only will I say, that the young man is worthy to be adopted by you as a son, after the fashion of our ances- tors.*</p><p>For sages, such as you, ought to accept from the State such children, so to speak, as we pray to receive from Nature. It will be a credit to you in your consul- ship to have a Quaestor whose father is of Prietorian, whose relatives are of Consular rank, and who, according to their own judgment, though still but a youth, has never- theless already reflected a mutual lustre on them. Accordingly favour my prayers, follow my advice, and above all, if I seem importunate, forgive me : first, because in a State in which everything is set about by those who, so to speak, take time by the forelock, efforts delayed till the regular time are apt to be too late instead of being in season; next, because, in regard to matters which one is anxious to obtain, the very anticipation of them is a pleasure. Let Bassus begin to revere you as his Consul; do you cherish him as your Quaestor. Finally, let us, who are deeply at- tached to both of you, enjoy in full a double delight. For since we have such a regard both for you and for Bassus that we should assist, in his pursuit of the honour, with all our resources, exertions, and influence, either Bassus,</p><p>if nomi- * Alluding to the close connection between Consul and Quaestor.

Honour still continues to be paid to intellectual pursuits.! On a recent occasion, when I was about to speak before the Centumviri, there was no way for me to get into the court except by the bench and right through the Judges : all the other parts were so closely packed. Add to this that a well-dressed youth, whose tunic had been torn, as often happens in a crowd, persisted in standing, wrapped up in his toga only, and that for seven hours ; for I spoke as long as that, not without great exertion and still greater effect. Let us follow our intellectual pursuits, then, and not allege other folks' slothfulness as an excuse for our own. There are those who will listen, there are those who will read, if only we take pains to produce what is worthy of people's ears or of the paper on which it is written.</p><p>(17-)</p><p>To AsiNius Gallus.</p><p>You not only admonish, but also entreat me to under- take the cause of Corellia, in her absence, against C. I am obliged to you for your admonition, but must complain of your entreat- ing me. For I ought to be admonished, to be informed, but I ought not to be entreated to do that which in my case it would be highly discreditable not to do. Can / hesitate to support the daughter of Corellius ? There exists, to be sure, between me and the person against whom you invoke my aid, if not an absolute intimacy, still a friendship.</p><p>Add to tliis the position of the man, and this very post of honour to which he is designated, to which it becomes me to pay all the more respect in that I have myself before now filled it. Indeed it is natural that one should wish to attach the greatest distinction to that which has been enjoyed by one's self. But when I reflect that it is on behalf of the daughter of Corellius that I am to appear, all these considerations seem frigid and futile.</p><p>Before my eyes is the image of that great man, than whom our age has produced none of greater dignity and piety and acuteness of judgment ; whom, when I had begun to love him owing to my admiration for him, I admired still more (the contrary of which usually happens), after becoming thoroughly acquainted with him. For I ivas thoroughly acquainted with him. He had no secret for me, either in his jesting or his serious, his sad or his cheerful moods.</p><p>I was still a stripling, and already he paid me the same honour, and I will venture to say it, respect, as to an equal.</p><p>He was my supporter and backer whenever I stood for office. He helped to escort and attend upon me when I entered on my charge, he was my adviser and guide in filling it. In short, whenever I had a function to fill, there was he, though feeble and old, to be seen, just as though he had been young and robust. How much did he add to my reputation in private, in public, and even with the prince ! For the conversation happening to turn, in the presence of the Emperor Nerva, on virtuous young men, and several persons having praised me, he remained silent for awhile, a habit which added greatly to his im- pressiveness ; and then, with that dignity which you remember, " Needs must be," says he, " that I should be more sparing of my praises of Secundus, inasmuch as he does nothing save by my advice." In this remark he attributed to me what it would have been extravagant to ask for in my prayers ; namely, that I did nothing except with the utmost wisdom, inasmuch as all that I did was by the advice of the wisest of men. More than this, on his death-bed, he said to his daughter (she tells the story herself), " I have prepared for you many friends, in virtue of my long life ; but the chief of them are Secundus and</p><p>Cornutus." When I recall this, I understand that everv effort must be used by me, not to seem to fall short in any way of the confidence reposed in me by a man of such sagacity. Wherefore, for my part, I shall certainly assist Corellia with all promptitude, and shall not refuse to expose myself to resentments.

She is gifted with remarkable quickness, as well as discretion, and she loves me, which is a token of her purity. To this must be added a love of literature which she has conceived from her tenderness for me. She has got my works, and studies them and even learns ' them by heart. How great is her anxiety when she sees me going to speak in court, and how great her joy when I have spoken ! She sets messengers about to report to her what favour and applause I have excited, and what is the result of the trial. Then, when- ever I recite, she sits hard by, separated from us only by a curtain, and catches up with eager ears the praises be- stowed on me. She even sings verses of my composing and sets them to her guitar, with no professor to teach her save love, the best of masters. All this leads me to entertain the surest hope of an unbroken harmony be- tween us, destined to increase day by day.

When the opinions of the judges were being taken in succession, Junius Mauricusthan whom there does not exist a more * The inhabitants of Vienna (now Vienne, in the South of France).</p><p>inflexible and straicjlitforward mandeclared that the contest ought not to be restored to the Viennenses. He added, " I wish these things could be done away with in Eome as well." Boldly and manfully spoken, you will say.</p><p>To be sure. But this is nothing new on the part of Mauricus. He spoke just as manfully in the company of the Emperor Nerva. Nerva was dining with a few friends, and Veiento reclined next to him, and even on his bosom :</p><p>I have said all, when I have named the man. The con- versation turned on Catullus Messalinus, who was blind, and in whom to a naturally cruel disposition were super- added the evils of blindness. He was without compunc- tion, without shame, without pity, on which account he was the more often hurled by Domitian -^just like darts which are themselves blind and without heed as they go alongagainst the best men of the State. It was this person's wickedness and sanguinary counsels that formed the subject of general conversation at the dinner-table , 

when the Emperor himself said, " What must we suppose would have been his fate if he were still living ? " Upon which Mauricus replied, " He would be dining with us !

I was the only one who had spoken in both ! Such are the changes which are produced either by the fragility of our mortal condition or by the fickle- ness of fortune. Some of those who pleaded on the former occasion are dead, others are in exile ; on one his age and his health have imposed abstinence from speaking ; an- other of his own accord enjoys a delightful repose; another is at the head of an army ; another has been excused from civil functions by the favour of the prince.

To Licinius Suka.</p><p>I have brouglit you from my native parts, in lieu of a present, a problem in a high degree worthy of your great attainments.</p><p>A certain spring rises in a mountain, and runs down through the rocks, till it is enclosed in a small dining-parlour made by hand ; after being slightly retarded there, it empties itself into the Larian lake. Its nature is very remarkable.</p><p>Three times a day it is increased and diminished in volume by a regular rise and fall.</p><p>This can be plainly seen, and when perceived is a source of great enjoyment. You recline close to it, and take your food and even drink from the spring itself (for it is remarkably cold) ; meanwhile, with a regular and measured movement, it either subsides or rises. If you place a ring or any other object on the dry ground, it is gradually moistened and finally covered over ; then again it comes to view, and is by degrees deserted by the water. If you watch long enough, you will see both of these pro- cesses repeated a second and even a third time. Can it be that some kind of hidden current of air at one time opens, and at another compresses, the mouth and jaws of BOOK IV. 143 the spring, according as it rushes in on its introduction, or recedes on being expelled ? We see that this happens in the case of narrow-necked vessels and objects of the same kind, with an orifice that is not wide, and is not immedi- ately open to the contents. For these, too, though they be turned over, or inclined, check the passage of what they pour forth, with a number of gulps, as it were, like the struggles of some resisting spirit. Or, is the nature of this spring the same as that of the ocean ; and in the same way as the latter ebbs and flows, is this small stream alternately drawn back and sent forth ? Or, again, like rivers which on their way to the sea are driven back by adverse winds and an opposing tide, so is there something which repels the free course of this spring ? Or is it that in its hidden ducts there is a regular reservoir, and that while this is collecting what has been exhausted, the stream is sent forth smaller and slower ; when it has col- lected it, swifter and larger ? Or, again, is there some sort of mysterious and hidden equipoise * which, when it is emptied, raises and elicits the spring ; when it is full, delays and throttles it ? Pray do you examine into the causes (as you are capable of doing) of this singular phenomenon.</p><p>For my part, it is enough if I made sufficiently clear the effects. * It is well remarked by Doering here.

Curianus begged me to present my share to him, and thus help him with a precedent* At the same time, he promised that it should be secured to me by a tacit agreement to that effect. I replied that it was not in accordance with my character to do one thing openly and another thing in secret, besides that it was not quite respectable to make a present to one who was both rich and childless ; f in short, that it would be of no service to him if I presented him with my share, but that it would be of service to him if I withdrew my claim to it, and that I was prepared to do so, if it were made plain to me that he had been disinherited unjustly. Upon which, said he, " Pray, investigate the matter."

BOOK V. 145 starting, that my determination will not fail me (in case that should seem the honest conclusion) to pronounce in favour of your mother. " As you wish," said he, " for you will wish nothing but what is most equitable." I called to my counsels two men of the highest character in the State at that time, Corellius and Frontinus, and with these on either side of me took my seat in my chamber. Curianus urged what he considered made for him ; I replied briefly (since there was no one else present to defend the honour of the deceased), then I retired to consult, and in accordance with the opinion of the council, " It seems to us, Curianus," said I, " that your mother had just grounds for being angry with you." After this he entered an action in the Centumviral Court a&lt;^ainst the remaining co-heirs, but not against me.</p><p>The day of the trial was approaching. ]\Iy co-heirs were desirous of coming to a settlement and compromising the matter, not from any distrust of their cause, but from fear of the times.* They were afraid of what they saw had happened to many, that as the result of a trial before the Centumviri they might be capitally indicted.</p><p>And, in truth, there were among them some who might have had their friendship both for Gratilla and Eusticus cast in their teeth. They begged me to have a talk with Curianus.</p><p>"We met in the Temple of Concord.</p><p>There, " If your mother," said I, " had left you heir to a fourth part of her property, pray, could you have complained ? t What if, though she had instituted you heir to the whole, she had so diminished the amount by bequests that no more than a fourth part remained to you ? You ought then to be satisfied if, after being disinherited by your mother, you receive a fourth part from her heirs, which, however, I will add to. You are aware that you entered no action against me, and that by this time two years have expired, so that I have obtained a right to my whole share in * The times of Domitian.

So now this very Curianus has left me a legacy, signalising this action of mine (which, if I do not flatter myself, was one in the ancient spirit) by a remarkable compliment.</p><p>All this I have written to you, because it is my habit to confer with you, just as with myself, about everything which either pleases or pains me ; and, further, it seemed hard to defraud you, who are so attached to me, of the pleasure I was myself enjoying.

There were some even, it seems, who, while not actually condemning these productions in themselves, yet found fault with me, in a kindly and outspoken way, for writing and reciting them. To these, at the risk of adding to my sin, I give this reply.</p><p>I do sometimes compose trifles in verse, of a not very grave character : I own to it ; and so too I listen to comedians, and go to see actors in farces, and read lyric poets, and appreciate productions in the style of Sotades ; * sometimes, moreover, I indulge in laughter, in jokes, in play, andto include in one term every species of harmless recreation -I am a man. Now, certainly, I cannot be offended at there being such an opinion of my character that persons should wonder at my writing these things who are ignorant of the fact that the most highly cultivated, most respectable, and most virtuous men have frequently scribbled in the same way.</p><p>Yet from those who do know what authorities I follow, and how great they are, I am confident that I shall easily obtain leave to err, provided it be in company with those whose sportive productions, as well as their serious actions, may be imitated with approval.

Ac- cordingly, I am led to recite by these incentives ; first, because he who recites will apply himself with a some- what keener attention to what he writes, out of regard for his audience ; next, because he will be able to decide on points which are doubtful, by virtue as it were of the decision of a council.</p><p>Again, he will receive many hints from many persons ; and even if he do not receive them, he will ascertain the sentiments of individual hearers, by their expression, their eyes, a nod of the head, a gesture of the hands, their silence eventhings which distinguish one's real opinion from mere complaisance by sufficiently evident signs.

Fannius has been announced to me, and this announcement has been to me a grievous shock, because, in the first place, I had a great affection for that man of taste and learning, and further, because I was in the habit of profiting by his judgment. He was indeed by nature acute, as well as practised by experience, and his sincerity made him ever ready. Besides these considerations, I am pained by the circumstances of his death : he has died with his old will in force, leaving out those whom he most regarded, and benefiting those with whom he was displeased.</p><p>This, however, might be in some way endurable ; what is more serious is, that he has left an admirable work unfinished.</p><p>For, though closely occupied by his practice at the bar, he was, nevertheless, engaged in writing of the ends of those who had been either put to death or banished by Nero. He had already completed three books, composed with taste and diligence, in pure Latin, and in a style midway between that of conversation and history ; and he was the more desirous of getting the remaining books completed, in consequence of the previous ones having found a number of eager readers. To me, however, the deaths of those who are preparing something immortal seem, in all cases, untimely and immature. For as to those who, given over to pleasures, live as it were for the day, these complete every day the purpose for which they exist.</p><p>Those, on the other hand, who contemplate pos- terity, and extend the memory of themselves by their worksto these no death can be other than sudden, since it always breaks off something which has been initiated.</p><p>Gains Fannius, indeed, had long foreseen the event.</p><p>BOOK V.   151   In a dream at night he seemed to himself to be reclining on his sofa, disposed in an attitude for study, with his case of books before him (as was his habit) : presently he dreamt that Nero came in and seated himself on the couch, and, taking out the first book which he (Fannius) had published on the subject of his crimes, turned over the leaves to the end ; then, that he did the same with the second and third books ; finally, that he departed. He was greatly alarmed, interpreting this to mean that he was destined to come to an end of his writing at the place where Nero made an end of reading, and so it turned out.</p><p>On recalling this, a feeling of commiseration comes over me to think what vigils, what labours, have been expended by him in vain. My mortal condition, my own writings, present themselves to my mind. Nor do I doubt that you too will be alarmed, by the same kind of reflection, for those things which you have in hand. So then, while life suffices, let us set to work, that death may have as little as possible to destroy. (6.) To DoMiTius Apollinaris.   I was much pleased with your care and soKcitude on my account, when, on hearing that I was about to repair to my Tuscan estate, in summer, you dissuaded me from doing so at a time when you deem it unhealthy. It is true that the side of Tuscany, which extends along the coast, is unwholesome and pestilential ; but this property of mine is a long way from the sea, and, moreover, under- lies the Apennine range, the most salubrious of mountains.</p><p>And further, that you may lay aside all fear on my ac- count, let me tell you about the character of the climate, the situation of the country, and the charms of my villa.</p><p>It will be a pleasure to you to hear of these things, and to me to relate them. JS2 PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>The climate in winter is cold and frosty, unfavourable and indeed fatal to myrtles and olive-trees, and everything else which delights in continuous warmth ; yet it is toler- ant of laurels, and in fact brings on very fine ones, some- times, it is true, killing them off, yet not more frequently than happens in the neighbourhood of Eome. The summers are wonderfully soft, the air is always stirred by a kind of breath ; yet it is more often breezy than windy.</p><p>Hence, old men are numerous, you may see the grand- fathers and great grandfathers of youths already grown, you may hear old stories and old folks' talk, and when you visit the place you may fancy yourself born in another age.</p><p>The lie of the country is charming : imagine a kind of amphitheatre of immense size, and such as nature alone can construct. A broad and spreading plain is surrounded by mountains ; the mountains on their highest summits are crowned with lofty and venerable forests, and in these there is game in plenty and variety. Next to these are woods for cutting, following the downward slope of the mountain ; and interspersed with them are rich and loamy knolls (indeed a stone does not readily present itself anywhere, even if you look for one) which do not yield in point of fertility to the flattest plains, and bring to maturity a rich harvest, though it be a somewhat late one.</p><p>Below these, vineyards stretch along the whole side of the mountain, and present a uniform appearance far and wide. They are terminated, or fringed so to speak at the base, by shrubberies. Then come meadows and corn- fields, fields which can be broken up only by the largest oxen and the strongest ploughs : the soil is so stiff and rises up in such huge clods when first cut into, that it is only by a course of nine plough ings that it can finally be reduced.</p><p>The meadows, gemmed with flowers, rear the trifolium and other kinds of herbage always soft and tender, and in a manner new ; everything being matured by never-failing streams. Yet, where there is the greatest quantity of water, there is no marsh, because the land, being on an incline, pours into the Tiber all the moisture which it receives and does not absorb.</p><p>That river runs through the middle of the estate, it is of a size to carry ships, and conveys the whole of our produce to Eome, that is to say, in winter and spring ; in summer it is lowered, and leaves the name of a large river to a dry channel ; in autumn it resumes its character.</p><p>You would be greatly charmed if you viewed this situation from the mountains ; you would fancy yourself looking not at so much country, but at a kind of landscape painted with the most exquisite beauty : such is the variety, such the harmonious disposi- tion, which refreshes the eye wherever it turns.</p><p>My villa commands as good a view of what lies under the hill as though it were on the summit ; so gentle and gradual is the unperceived rise to it that you find you have made an ascent, without knowing that you have been ascending. At its back it has the Apennines, but some way off.</p><p>From these it enjoys breezes, however calm and un- ruffled the day, not sharp or cutting ones, however, but such as are softened and broken by the mere space they have passed over. It has, for the most part, a southerly aspect, and invites -if I may so speakinto a broad and slightly projecting cloister the summer sun from the sixth hour, the winter sun rather earlier. In this cloister there are several apartments, and a hall, too, after the ancient fashion. In . front of the cloister is a variegated terrace walk, with borders of box, then a descent to a sloping garden bank, with forms of animals cut out in box facing each other.</p><p>On the Bat ground is an acanthus so soft that I had almost called it liquid.</p><p>Eound this is a walk, enclosed by ever- greens planted close, and cut into different shapes.</p><p>Beyond this is a promenade in the form of a ring, wliich encircles the variously shaped boxes and the low trimmed shrubs.</p><p>All this is protected by a wall covered and con- cealed by a sloping hedge of box.</p><p>Then comes a green expanse not less worthy to be viewed for its natural than what has been above mentioned for its artificial beauties.</p><p>There are fields further on and many other green meads and coppices.</p><p>Prom the extremity of the cloister a dining-room pro- jects.</p><p>Through its folding doors it looks out on the end of the terrace walk, and straight on the green expanse and a large extent of country ; from its windows, in one direction, it commands the side of the terrace walk and the project- ing part of the villa ; in the other, the trees in the riding- school and their foliage. OjDposite to about the middle of the cloister, there is a receding building which encloses a small court shaded by four plane-trees.</p><p>Among these a fountain gushes forth from an orifice of marble, refreshing with its gentle spray the plane-trees which are disposed around it, and everything underlying them.</p><p>There is in this building a sleeping-apartment, which excludes day- light and loud noises and even sounds ; and adjoining this a dining-parlour for every-day use and the reception of friends.</p><p>It commands the small court of which I spoke and the cloister, and the same prospect as that from the cloister.</p><p>There is also another saloon which enjoys the verdure and shade of a plane-tree close to it, adorned with marble to the height of the window openings, and above this with wall-paintings which in beauty do not yield to the marble ; they represent trees, and birds sitting on the trees. There is a small fountain in this room, and a basin to the fountain ; around it a number of jets combine to produce a most delightful murmur. At the angle of the cloister a large saloon faces the dining-room. Some of its windows look down on the terrace walk, and others on the paddocks, but first of all upon the piscina, which is an attraction to and underlies the windows, and is a pleasant object to the ear as well as the eye, for the water rushes down from a height and foams as it strikes on the marble bottom.</p><p>This same saloon is extremely warm in winter time, owing to its being penetrated by a great quantity of sunlight.</p><p>A heating-room is attached to it, %vhich, on BOOK V. 155 cloudy days, supplies the place of the sun by the warm air it pours in.</p><p>Next to this a roomy and cheerful dress- ing-room conducts you to the cold-bathing apartment, where there is a large and sheltered plunging-bath. If you wish to swim more at your ease, or in warmer water, there is a piscine in the court and a reservoir hard by, where you may brace yourself afresh if you have had too much of the warmth. With the cold bath-room is con- nected one of medium temperature, which is particularly favoured by the sun ; this is still more the case with the hot bath-room, for it is projecting. In this there are three tiers of baths, two enjoying the sun, the third less warm, but not less lifrht.</p><p>Over the dressing-room is the tennis- court, large enough for several kinds of games and several parties of players.</p><p>Not far from the bath is a staircase which leads to a covered cloister, first of all, however, to three parlours.</p><p>One overlooks the little court in which are the four plane-trees, another the paddocks, the third the vineyards, so that each has a different aspect as weK as prospect.</p><p>At the upper end of the covered cloister is a saloon cut out of the cloister itself, which commands the riding-school, the vineyards, and the mountains. Adjoining this is another saloon exposed to the sun, especially in winter.</p><p>Next comes an apartment which connects the villa with the riding-school. Such are the appearance and the arrangement of the house in front.</p><p>At the side is a covered cloister for summer use, situated on a rising ground, which seems not so much to look upon the vineyards as to be touching them. In the centre of this, a dining-room receives a very wholesome air from the Apennine valleys ; behind, it admits, as one may say, the vineyards through windows of great size, and the same vineyards, through its folding doors, viewed along the cloister.</p><p>On the side of this dining-room, on which there are no windows, a staircase serves for introducing what is necessary for the repast, by a more private entrance. At the end is a saloon, to whicli the cloister itself furnishes a prospect no less agreeable than the vineyards.</p><p>Underneath is another cloister, which resembles an underground one. In summer it is extremely cool, and, sufficiently supplied with air of its own, is neither in want of nor admits the external atmosphere. After the two cloisters, at the point where the dining-room ends, a colonnade begins, with a winter temperature before midday and a summer one in the afternoon. This forms the approach to two suites of rooms, in one of which are four saloons, and in the other three ; and these, as the sun goes round, enjoy either the sunshine or the shade.</p><p>The disposition and charms of the villa are, however, far surpassed by the riding-ground, an open expanse which presents itself in its entirety to your eyes the moment you enter it. It is surrounded by plane-trees, and these are clothed with ivy, so that the tops of them are green with their own leaves, and the lower parts with the leaves of the other.</p><p>The ivy creeps over trunk and branches, and links together neighbouring planes in its passage. The interstices are filled by box. The exterior boxes are encircled by laurels which add their shade to that of the planes.</p><p>The straight line of the riding-ground is broken at the extreme end by a semicircle, so as to present a different appearance. This is surrounded and protected by cypresses, and thus darkened and obscured by a deeper shade ; but the inner circles (for there are several of them) enjoy the clearest day.</p><p>Hence, too, they bear roses, and produce a diversion from the cool shade by their pleasant sunniness. At the end of these winding ways, with their varied and diversified character, comes the straight road again, and not one only, for a number of paths are separated from each other by intervening boxes. At one point a lawn, at another point the box itself comes in, cut into a thou- sand shapes, sometimes into those of letters, which give you here the name of the owner, there that of the artist ; sometimes every other one rises in the form of a small BOOK V.</p><p>157 pyramid, and its neighbour has an apple-tree planted in the middle of it, an unexpected imitation as it were of the rustic introduced into an object which smacks a good deal of the town. A space in the middle is ornamented on both sides by dwarf plane-trees. Beyond, there is an acanthus, pliant and flexible in all directionsthen more figures and more names. At the top is a semicircular seat of white marble, shaded by a vine ; the vine is supported by four small columns of Carystian marble. From this seat water gushes forth through tiny pipes, just as if it were set in motion by the weight of the persons reclining. It is collected in the hollowed rock, and deposited in a polished marble basin, being so regulated by a hidden contrivance, as to fill without overflowing it. My pic-nic tray and the heavier part of my dinner-service are placed on the edge of the basin, the lighter parts make the round of the water, floating in the form of little boats and birds.</p><p>On the other side is a fountain which projects water and receives it again ; for, after being propelled to a height, it falls back on the same place, being absorbed and emitted through orifices which communicate with each other.</p><p>Eight opposite the seat is a saloon which reflects as much ornament on the seat as it derives from it. It is resplendent with marble, its folding-doors project into the shrubbery, and from its upper and lower windows it looks down upon and up to other shrubberies. Next comes a retreating cabinet, a part as it were and yet not a part of the saloon. Here there is a couch, and windows on every side, yet the light is obscured by the depth of the shade ; for a luxurious vine scrambles and mounts up the whole building to the roof. You may He here just as if you were in a grove, the only difference being that you will not feel the showers as you would in a grove. Here, too, a foun- tain rises and immediately disappears. At many points marble seats are disposed, as resting to the weary walker as the saloon itself could be.</p><p>Small fountains adjoin the seats.</p><p>Throughout the whole of the riding-ground there are gurgling streams introduced, by means of pipes, follow- ing the lead of man's hand ; by the aid of these the various shrubs are watered at different times and sometimes all of them together.</p><p>I should long since have avoided the imputation of loquacity, had I not determined to go round every corner of the place with you in my letter. Nor was I afraid that you would be wearied with reading of that which you would not weary of seeing in person ; especially as you might rest between whiles, if so disposed, and laying down the letter, often take a seat, so to speak. Besides I have indulged my partiality ; for I am partial to what was in great part laid out by myself or completed by me after it had been laid out. To sum up (for why not freely inform you of my opinion, it may be my mistaken one ?), I deem it the first duty of a writer to read over his title and from time to time ask himself what it was that he undertook to write about, feeling sure that if he only sticks to his subject he will not be tedious, while he will be very tedious indeed if he goes in quest of or drags in any foreign matter. You see the number of lines in which Homer and Virgil describe, the one the arms of ^neas, the other those of Achilles ; yet each of them is brief, because he is only doing what he proposed to do. You see how Aratus follows up and catalogues even the tiniest stars : yet he observes the bounds : here is no digression on his part, it is the very work he has to do. Similarly, in my case (to compare small things with great), when I am endeavouring to set the whole of my villa before your eyes, provided I say nothing alien to the subject and as it were out of the way, it is not the letter which gives the descrip- tion, but the villa which is described, that is of great size.</p><p>However, to return to my starting-point, for fear of being justly censured in accordance with my own rule, if I go further with this digression of mine; you now know why I prefer my Tuscan property to those at Tusculum, BOOK V. 159 Tibur, and Prseneste. For in addition to what has been mentioned, the retirement there is more complete, more snug, and consequently less liable to interruption. There is no need to put on one's toga ; nobody wants you in the neighbourhood ; everything is calm and quiet ; and this in itself adds to the healthiness of the locality no less than the brightness of the sky and the clearness of the atmosphere.</p><p>Here, both mentally and bodily, I am in especial vigour ; for my mind I exercise by study, and my body by the chase. My household too are nowhere in better health.</p><p>Up to this time, at any rate, I have not lost there a single person among those whom I brought out with me (may no harm come of my saying so !).</p><p>May the gods continue for the future this, which is a joy to me and a glory to the place.</p><p>(7-)</p><p>To Calvisius Eufus.</p><p>It is plain that a community can neither be constituted heir-at-law, nor take preferentially. Yet Saturninus, who has left us his executors,* has given a fourth part of his property to our community, -f-and subsequently, in lieu of this fourth, a preferential legacy of four hundred thousand sesterces. % This, if you look to the law, is null and void ; if to the intention of the deceased, it is valid and not to be upset. Now, to my way of thinking, the intention of the deceased (I am apprehensive how the lawyers may take what I am going to say) is of higher import than the letter of the law, particularly in the case of what it was intended should go to our common birth-place. Could I, who have bestowed on it eleven hundred thousand sesterces § out of my own purse, refuse to this community * Heredes.

I am sure that you, in particular, will not be opposed to my judgment, seeing that like an admirable citizen you cherish this same birth- place of ours.</p><p>I should wish then that, the next time the town-council come together, you would point out to them the law of the case, briefly however and quietly ; then add that we make them a present of the four hundred thousand sesterces, in accordance with Saturninus's in- junctions.</p><p>His be the gift, his the liberality ; let our part be styled compliance merely. I have desisted from writing all this publicly, first because I remembered that the closeness of our friendship, and the strength of your own perspicuity, would make it your duty as well as put it in your power to speak for me as well as yourself ; next because I feared that the proper mean, which it will be easy for you to preserve when speaking, might seem not to have been observed in a letter. For a speech receives its tone from the expression, the gestures, the voice itself, which accompany it ; while a letter, being destitute of all such commendations, is exposed to the malignity of its interpreters.</p><p>(8.)</p><p>To TiTiNius Capito.</p><p>You advise me to write a history, and you are not singular in giving this advice.</p><p>Many persons, at many times, have urged me to the same effect ; and for my part I am willing to do so, not from any confidence that the work will be easy to me (it would be rash to suppose this, un- less one had tried), but because it seems in a high degree noble not to allow those to perish who have merited im- mortality, and to extend the fame of others in company with one's own. Moreover, to me there is no inducement so strong as the love and longing for an enduring fame, a longing in every way worthy of a man, especially of one BOOK V. i6i who is conscious of no guilt, and hence does not dread being remembered by posterity. So by day, and night too, I ponder -" By what fair means to raise my grovelling name."</p><p>Eor this would satisfy my wishes. The rest would be beyond my wishes -" To flit a victor through the lips of men." * " Yet, oh ! " t However, the former suffices me ; and this, historical com- position seems almost alone to promise. For an oration or a poem meets with small favour, unless it be in the loftiest style, whereas a history pleases in whatever way it is written; since men are by nature inquisitive, and charmed at being made acquainted with events in the barest fashion, being indeed often led away by even small stories and tales. In my case, I am further impelled to this pursuit by an example in my own family; my maternal uncle, who was also my father by adoption, wrote histories, and with the most religious care too. Now, I find it stated by the sages that it is a noble thing to follow in the footsteps of one's ancestors, provided only the way they have gone before you was the right one. Why hesi- tate?</p><p>I have pleaded in great and important causes. These speeches of mine (though with but slender hopes from them) I propose to revise, lest the results of such great toil should perish with me, if I fail to bestow this remaining attention on them ; for to those who take account of posterity, whatever is not perfected is as though it had never been begun. You will say, "You can rewrite your speeches and compose a history at the same tanced, cries out -importance that it is more than enough to accomplish one of them. I began to speak in the rorum in my nineteenth year, and only now perceive, yet still through a mist, what is required of an orator. What if to such a burden a fresh one be added? No doubt an oration and a history have much that is common; they have, however, still more numerous diversities, and precisely in those points which seem to be common to them. Both are in the way of narra- tion, but in a different style. In the one case, simple, common, every-day language is mostly suitable ; in the other, there should be everywhere profundity, brilliancy, and elevation.</p><p>The one is in general all bone, muscle, and sinew ;</p><p>the other requires to be set off by fleshly integuments and, if I may so express it, a flowing crest. The one pleases, above all, by its vigour, its incisiveness, its persistency ; the other by its expansiveness and gentleness, and even sweetness. In short, the language is different ; the tone and the style of composition are different. For there is a wide distinction, as Thucjdides has it, between ['a permanent possession" and "a contest for a prize."</p><p>An oration is the latter, a history is the former .^F or these reasons, I am not tempted to mix up and confound two</p><p>matters so dissimilar, and which their very importance dis- tinguishes from each other ; fearing that I should lose my head in such a medley, so to speak, and be found writing in one place what I ought to be writing in the other.

The judges were sitting, the decemvirs had come in, the advocates were in full view, there was a long silence. At length came a message from the Prsetor.</p><p>The Centumviri were dismissed, and pro- ceedings suspended for the day ; to my delight, who am never so well prepared as not to be rejoiced at a delay.</p><p>The reason for the adjournment was that Nepos the Praetor is conducting an investigation in accordance with the law. He had put forth a short edict, in which he warned prosecutors and defendants as well, that he should carry out the provisions of the Senate's decree.</p><p>The decree in question was appended to the edict.</p><p>It ordered everybody who was engaged in legal pro- ceedings to make oath before litigating, that he had not given, promised, or guaranteed anything to any one in return for his advocacy.</p><p>Such were the words, and a number of others besides, by which the sale and barter of advocacy were forbidden.

Before assuming office, he took cognisance of the law, and read the Senate's decrees ; now, he checks bargains which are dis- graceful in the extreme, and will not allow what is a most noble avocation to be the subject of barter." Such are the opinions expressed, which will prevail on one side or the other, according to the event. For though it is alto- gether unfair, yet it is a received usage, that designs whether creditable or scandalous, according as they turn out successful or unsuccessful, are proportionately either approved or blamed.

For I have two reasons for reciting : one, that I may be stimulated by apprehension ; the other, that I may be admonished in case anything chances to escape me, as being my own work. I was gratified in my desire, and found persons to place their advice at my disposal. Further, on my own account, I noted some things for correction ; and have corrected the book and sent it to you. You will learn the subject from the title, the rest the book itself will explain; and indeed the time has now come when it must accustom itself to be intelligible without any prefatory remarks. Please to write me your opinion of the whole as well as of the parts. For I shall be either more cautious in the way of keeping it back, or more emboldened to publish it, according as your authority shall be added in one direction or the other.</p><p>(13) To Valeeianus.</p><p>You ask of me, and I promised in case you asked, to write you word of the issue of Nepos's proposal with regard to Tuscilius Nominatus.* Nominatus was introduced, and pleaded his own cause in person, no one appearing to prosecute ; for the agents from Vicentia not only refrained from pressing him, but actually assisted him. The substance of his defence was that his courage, and not his honour, had failed him in his office of advocate ; that he had come down with the intention of speaking and had even been seen in court</p><p>; that he had subsequently retired, frightened by the observations of his friends ; for they had * See Letter 4 of this book. BOOK V. i6 advised him not to offer such a pertinacious resistance to the wishes of a Senator (especially in the Senate) whose contention seemed no longer about markets merely, but concerning his own influence, reputation, and dignity ; that, otherwise, he would be exposed to still greater odium than was recently the case. And in truth, on the former occa- sion, some cries had been raised against him, though only by a few however, as he left the court.* He supplemented all this with prayers and a quantity of tears : indeed throughout the whole of his speech this practised pleader took pains to appear rather as one entreating forgiveness (certainly the more popular and safer course), than as if defending himself. He was acquitted on the motion of Afranius Dexter, consul elect, the substance of which was to the effect that, while Nominatus would certainly have done better if he had carried through the cause of the Vicetians in the same spirit as that in which he had undertaken it ; yet, as he had fallen into this kind of error with no fraudulent intent, and was proved to have committed nothing worthy of punishment, he ought to be discharged, on condition of returning his fees to the Vicetians. This was assented to by all, with the exception of Fabius Aper, who proposed that Nominatus should be disbarred for five years, and though he could not carry any one by his authority, he remained fixed in his opinion. More than this, after citing the law on the subject of convening the Senate, he insisted that Dexter, who had originated the opposite proposal, should make oath " that what he had proposed was in the interest of the State." Though this demand was in accordance with law, yet several cried out against it as seeming to charge corrupt motives on the mover. However, before the votes of the Senate were given, Nigrinus, a tribune of the people, read out an * Adclamatum eratexeunti.

After a few days, came a rescript from the Emperor, severe yet moderate withal.</p><p>You can read the original : it is in the Gazette.</p><p>How glad I am that in conducting my cases I have always declined, not only compacts, presents, and fees, but even trifling cadeaux.

It is impossible to express the pleasure experienced by me, both on his and my account; on his because, though he may be, as certainly he is, far removed from every kind of ambition, yet an honour spontaneously conferred must needs be agreeable to him; on mine, BOOK V. 169 because the office entrusted to me gives me no inconsider- able additional pleasure when I see a similar one bestowed on Cornutus.* For, to be advanced in dignity is not more grateful than to be put on a par with good men. And where is there a better man than Cornutus ? Or a more virtuous ?</p><p>Or one more closely moulded to the pattern of antiquity in every species of good repute ? All which was known to me not from fame onlygreat and merited of itself as is the fame which he enjoysbut from a long and intimate experience of him. We love in unison, and have loved in unison, almost all those of either sex whom our epoch has produced as worthy of imitation ; a partner- ship in friendships which has bound us together in the closest intimacy. To this has been superadded the tie of a public connection ; he was, as you know, my colleague (as though accorded to my prayers) in the Prsefectureship of the treasury, and also in the Consulship. Then it was that I thoroughly ascertained what sort of man, and how great a man he was, as I followed him in the capacity of magistrate, and venerated him in that of a parent ; which was what he deserved, not so much from maturity of years as of character.</p><p>For these reasons, I congratulate myself as well as him, and on public as much as on private grounds : since now at last men's virtues advance them, not as formerly to posts of danger, but to posts of honour. But my letter would never end, if I were to indulge my joy. I must rather turn to what I was doing here when the announce- ment reached me. I was with my wife's grandfather, and her aunt, with friends long desired ; I was going the round of my farms, listening to a number of rustic complaints, looking over accounts, against the grain, and superficially, (for very different are the papers and the writings with which I am conversant) I had, moreover, begun to make preparations for returning to Eome, being bound by the narrow limits of my leave of absence, and this very news * Pliny was at this time a Commissioner of the Tiber.</p><p>"whicli reaches my ears of the office conferred on Cornutus reminds me of my own.

To Arkius Antoninus.</p><p>It is on trying to imitate your verses, that I experience most strongly how excellent they are. For just as painters can seldom make a portrait of a lovely and exquisite face that does not fall short of the original, so do I trip and fall away from such an archetype. All the more then do I exhort you to favour us with as many as possible of these productions, such as all will be eager, and very few, if any, will be able to imitate.</p><p>(i6.)</p><p>To Marcellinus.</p><p>I write this to you in great distress. The younger daughter of our friend Fundanus is dead. She was a young lady than whom I never saw a livelier or a more lovable, or one more worthy not only of a longer life, but wellnigh of immortality.</p><p>She had not yet completed her fourteenth year, and already she had the judgment of a woman of advanced age, and the gravity of a matron, and yet girlhood's sweetness, too, coupled with maidenly reserve.</p><p>How she was wont to hang on her father's neck ! How lov- ingly and, at the same time, modestly she used to embrace us, her father's friends ! How she cherished her nurses, and governors, and tutors, according to their several offices ! How studiously and intelligently she read ! How sparing and guarded she was in her recreations ! With what self- restraint, what patience, aye, what intrepidity did she bear her last illness ! She obeyed the doctors, encouraged her sister and her father, and sustained herself, after her bodily strengtli had failed, by the force of her will. This lasted her to the end, and was not shaken either by the length of her illness or by the fear of death, so as to leave us still more numerous and weighty grounds for our regret and our sorrow. What an altogether sad and premature decease ! And the time of her death was still more cruel than death itself. For she was already betrothed to an admirable young man ; already a day had been fixed upon for the nuptials ; we, the guests, were already invited.</p><p>What joy turned to what mourning ! I cannot express in words how my soul was wounded on hearing Fundanus himselfin the way that grief is fruitful in discovering assravationsordering that the sum he had intended to pay for dresses and pearls and jewellery should be laid out on incense and unguents and perfumes. He to be sure is a man of culture and philosophy, having devoted himself from his earliest years to profound studies and sciences ; but now he despises all the topics which he has so often listened to and himself uttered, and, throwing to the winds the other virtues, is engrossed in his paternal affection. You will pardon, you will even praise him, if you think of what he has lost. He has lost a daughter who resembled him in character no less than in countenance and expres- sion, who was a marvellously faithful copy of her father in all respects.</p><p>If, then, you should chance to be writing to him on the subject of a sorrow so legitimate, mind and give him some consolation, not in the chiding style, not too heroic, but gentle and friendly. The lapse of time which will have intervened will do much towards making him receive this more readily ; for just as a wound, still raw, shrinks from the hands of those who would treat it, yet afterwards submits to and itself invites them, so a mental sorrow, when fresh, rejects and flies from consola- tions, yet presently it yearns for them, and is calmed by their gentle application. ( <ref type="formula">170</ref>To Spurinna.</p><p>I know how eagerly you favour the polite arts, and how great is your joy whenever young nobles do anything worthy of their ancestors. So I make the more haste to tell you that to-day I formed part of Calpurnius Piso's audience.</p><p>He recited his " Legends of the Stars," assur- edly an erudite and brilliant theme. It was treated in elegiacs, flowing and tender and smooth, elevated too M'hen the occasion required ; for with much aptness and variety the tone was at one time raised, and lowered at another.</p><p>He changed from the lofty to the subdued, from brevity to copiousness, from gay to grave, always with the same happy talent. And all this was enhanced by the sweetest of voices, and the voice itself by his modesty. His face was suffused with many a blush and much anxiety, great charms in one who recites. In truth, I know not how it is, but in literary pursuits timidity is more becoming to men than assurance. However, no more : though I would fain say more, and the rather that all this is so handsome on the part of a young man, and so rare on that of a noble.</p><p>At the close of the recitation, after bestowing a long and hearty embrace on the youth, I incited him by praises -which are the strongest stimulus to encourasrementto go on as he had begun, so as to exhibit, for the guid- ance of his descendants, the same bright light which his ancestors had exhibited to him. I congratulated his ex- cellent mother, and his brother as well, who obtained no less credit from that audience for his fraternal affection than the other son for his eloquence ; in such a marked way did his apprehension, first of all, for his brother while in the act of reciting, and presently his joy, reveal itself. The gods grant that I may often have such news to tell you ! for the age in which we live has my best wishes that it be not sterile and effete ; and I earnestly hope that our nobles may have something in their houses to be admired besides those ancestral images which in the case of these youths seem now to me to be silently applauding and exhorting andwhich is of sufficient account for the glory of both acknowledging them.</p><p>(18.)

I would beg you therefore to write to your people, that the establishment and the house may be open to him ; also that they may contribute to his expenses, if he wants anything ; he will, however, want but little, for he is so economical and temperate that he restricts himself most frugally not only in the matter of indulgences, but even in things necessary for his health.

On being introduced into the Senate, they demanded a commission of inquiry. Varenus asked that he, as well as they, might be allowed to compel the attendance of witnesses for the purposes of his defence.</p><p>The Bithynians demurring to this, the point was debated. I pleaded for Varenus, and not without re- sult, but whether well or ill my book f will show. For in the case of speeches in court, fortune carries the day, either way ; memory, voice, gesture, the particular occa- sion, finally one's affection for, or else detestation of the accused, these are things which greatly detract from, or add to, the commendation they receive ; whereas a book excites neither offence nor partiality, and is independent of accidents whether fortunate or adverse.</p><p>Fonteius Magnus, one of the Bithynians, replied to me with great abundance of words and much paucity of mat- ter.</p><p>In most of the Greeks, as in him, volubility takes the place of copiousness : such long and dreary periods do they pour forth at a breath just like a torrent.

Are we more just than the laws themselves, which freely accord so many hours, so many days, so many adjournments ?

Now, however, the consideration of your delicate health, as well as your absence, torments me with vague disquietudes of various kinds, I apprehend everything, conjure up everything, and, as the nature of frightened people is, the things which of all others I deprecate are pre- cisely those which I picture to myself.

What to my mind was a most painful feature in all this, was that each had got information of what the other was preparing for him ; for Celsus replied to Nepos from a written paper, and Nepos to Celsus from his note-book. Such was the loquacity of their friends that these men, on the point of wrangling, had a mutual knowledge of the event, just as though it had been arranged between them.</p><p>BOOK VL 183 (6.)</p><p>To FUNDANUS.

But now there are many in the Senate to whom he was unknown, and though there are many to whom he was known, yet these honour none but the living ; so that my friend, putting aside the glory of his fatherwhich, though a great illustration, is but a feeble recommendation to him must all the more vigorously exert himself and go to work in person. And this to be sure he has always care- fully done, as if foreseeing the present occasion.

To Albinus.</p><p>On my arrival at my mother-in-law's house near Alsium, which was once the property of Eufus Verginius,* the sight of the place itself painfully renewed my regrets for that admirable and illustrious man. For this was the retreat where he commonly resided, calling it indeed " the dear little nest of his old age." Turn where I would, my soul, my eyes, looked for him. I was desirous of seeing his monument as well, and repented having seen it. For it is still unfinished ; nor is this owing to any difficulty in the undertaking (which is of moderate, or rather small, dimensions), but to the apathy of the person on whom the duty was enjoined. A sense of indignation mingled with pity steals over me to think that ten years after his death there should be lying without an epitaph, without a name over them, the ashes of one the glory of whose memory pervades the world. Yet he bad enjoined and provided that that divine and immortal exploit of his should be inscribed in verse.</p><p>" Here Eufus lies, who Vindex overcame, Not for his own, but for his country's fame." So rare is fidelity in friendship, so easy is it to forget the dead, that we ought to raise for ourselves even our own sepulchres and to anticipate all the duties of our heirs.</p><p>For who has not cause to fear what we see to have hap- pened in the case of Verginius ?

He has had to defend, and as it were make fresh application for, that which he had ob- tained only after a great struggle.* The Bithynians were impudent enough to criticise the decree of the Senate, and even to try and invalidate it, before the Consuls, and actually to incriminate it to the Emperor, who was absent from Eome. On being referred back to the Senate by him, they did not desist from their efforts. Claudius Capito spoke for them, disrespectfully rather than firmly, since he impeached a decree of the Senate in presence of the Senate, Catius Fronto replied with dignity and resolution.</p><p>The Senate itself was admirable. For even those who had previously been for refusing the applica- tion of Varenus were of opinion that, having once been allowed, it should still be allowed, on the ground that though it was permissible for individuals to differ when a matter was undecided, yet when it was fairly settled the "ision of the majority should be unanimously upheld.</p><p>* See Letter 5 of this Book, and Book V. , Letter 20.   igo PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>Only Acilius Eufus and, with him, some seven or eightseven ratherpersisted in their former opinion.

Passennus Paulus, a distinguished Eoman knight, and among the first for learning, writes elegiac verse. This runs in his family ; he is a townsman of Propertius, and even numbers Propertius among his ancestors. As this Paulus was reciting, he commenced with these words -"Priscus, thou bids't me."</p><p>Upon which Javolenus Prisons (who was present in his * He means -I would rather re-I like.

You may imagine how the people laughed and jested. To be sure, Priscus is of doubtful sanity, yet he takes part in ceremonial occasions, sits as assessor to the magistrates, and even gives legal opinions publicly, v/hich makes this action of his all the more ridiculous and remarkable. Meanwhile Paulus, through another's folly, found his audience somewhat chilled.</p><p>Such particular care should people take beforehand, when they are going to recite, not only to be sane themselves, but also to invite none but sane hearers.</p><p>(16.)</p><p>To Tacitus.</p><p>You ask me to write you an account of my uncle's end, in order that you may be able the more faithfully to transmit it to posterity.

For thouf^h he fell amid the destruction of such fair regions, and seems destined to live for everlike so many peoples and citiesthrough the memorable character of the disaster; though he himself was the author of many and enduring works ; yet the immortality of your writings will add greatly to the uninterrupted continuance of his fame. For my part I deem those blessed to whom, by favour of the gods, it has been granted either to do what is worth writing of, or to write what is worth reading ; above measure blessed those on whom both gifts have been con- ferred.</p><p>In the latter number will be my uncle, by virtue of his own and of your compositions. Hence, I the more readily undertake, and even lay claim to peform what you request.</p><p>He was at Misenum, in personal command of the fleet.</p><p>The ninth day before the Kalends of September, at about the seventh hour, my mother indicated to him the appear- ance of a cloud of unusual size and shape. He had sunned himself, and next gone into his cold bath ; and after a light meal, which he took reposing, was engaged in study. He called for his sandals, and ascended to a spot from which this portent could best be seen. A cloud was risingfrom what mountain was a matter of uncertainty to those who looked at it from a distance : afterwards it was known to be Vesuviuswhose appearance and form would be re- presented by a pine better than any other tree. For, after towering upwards to a great height with an extremely lofty stem, so to speak, it spread out into a number of branches; because, as I imagine, having been lifted up "by a recent breeze, and having lost the support of this as it grew feebler, or merely in consequence of yielding to its own weight, it was passing away laterally. It was at one time white, at another dingy and spotted, according as it carried earth or ashes. To a man of my uncle's attain- ments, it seemed a remarkable phenomenon, and one to be observed from a nearer point of view. He ordered his fast-sailing cutter to be got ready, and, in case I wished to accompany him, gave me leave to do so. I replied that I preferred to go on with my studies, and it so happened that he had himself given me something to write out.</p><p>He was in the act of leavincj the house, when a note was handed him from Rectina.* Coesius Bassus, frightened, together with the people there,* at the imminence of the peril (for his villa lay under the mountain, and there was no escape for him except by taking ship), begged my uncle to rescue him from so critical a situation. Upon this he changed his plan, and, having started on his enterprise as a student, proceeded to carry it out in the spirit of a hero.</p><p>He launched his four-ranked galleys, and embarked in person, in order to carry assistance, not to Rectina only, but to many others, for the charms of the coast caused it to be much peopled. He hastened in the direction whence * Apparently a place between Por-inniinenti periculo extcJTitae.

Ashes were already fall- ing on the ships, hotter and thicker the nearer they ap- proached ; and even pumice and other stones, black, and scorched, and cracked by the fire. There had been a</p><p>sudden retreat of the sea, and the debris from the mountain made the shore unapproachable. Having hesitated for a moment whether to turn back, he shortly called out to the helmsman (who was urging him to do so), " Fortune favours the brave ! Make in the direction of Pomponianus."</p><p>The latter was at Stabise, separated from him by the whole width of the bay, for the sea flows in by shores gradually winding and curving inwards.</p><p>There, in view of the danger which, though it had not yet approached, was nevertheless manifest, and must be upon them as soon as it extended itself, he had got his effects together on board ship, resolved to fly,* if only the wind left off blowing from the opposite quarter. My uncle, brought to shore by this same wind, which precisely favoured him, embraced his trembling friend, consoling and exhorting him, and, in order to calm his fears by his own sang froid, bade them conduct him to the bath. After bathing, he took his place at table, and dined gaily, or (which was equally heroic) with an air of gaiety.</p><p>Meanwhile, from many points of Mount Vesuvius, vast sheets of flame and tall columns of fire were blazing, the flashes and brightness of which were heightened by the darkness of night.</p><p>My uncle, to soothe the terrors of those about him, kept telling them that these were fires which the frightened country people had left to burn, and that the deserted houses were blazing away all by them- * Certus fugae.

They consulted tosjether whether to remain under cover or wander about in the open; for the walls nodded under the repeated and tremendous shocks, and seemed, as though dislodged from their foundations, to be swaying to and fro, first in one direction and then in another. On the other hand, in the open air, there was the fall of the pumice-stones (though they were light and burnt out) to be apprehended. However, a comparison of dangers led to the choice of the latter course. With my uncle indeed it was a case of one reason getting the better of another; while in the case of others fear overcame fear.</p><p>They covered their heads with pillows tied round with cloths : this was their way of protecting themselves against the shower. By this time it was day else- where, but there it was night, the blackest and thickest of all nights, which, however, numerous torches and lights of various kinds served to alleviate.</p><p>It was decided to make for the shore, in order to learn from the nearest point whether the sea was by this time at all available.</p><p>A huge and angry sea still continued running. Here, reclining on a cloth which had been thrown on the ground, my imcle more than once called for a draught of cold water and swallowed it. Upon this, an outbreak of flame and smell of sulphur, premonitory of farther flames, put some to flight and roused him.</p><p>With the help of two slave-boys he rose from the ground, x^uipii^cJcHiniediately fell back, owing (as I gather) to the BOOK VI. 195 dense vapour obstructing his breath and stopping up the access to his gullet, which with him was weak and narrow and frequently subject to wind.</p><p>When day returned (the third from that which he had looked upon for the last time *) his body was found whole and uninjured, in the dress he wore ; its appearance was that of one asleep rather than dead.</p><p>Meanwhile my mother and I at Misenumhowever, this has nothing to do with history, nor did you wish to learn anything except what related to his death.

At the last Comitia the Senate gave expression to an opinion which did it great honour : " that candidates should not give banquets, nor send presents, nor lodge money for the purpose of bribery," of which practices the two former were carried on as openly as they were unstintedly, and the third, though done privately, was perfectly ascertained.</p><p>Upon which my friend Homullus carefully availing himself of this consensus of the Senate when called on to vote, proposed a resolution that the Consuls should make known the universal wish to the Emperor, and should beg him, as he had done in the case of other abuses, to employ his sagacity in counteracting this one.</p><p>He is counteracting it : by a bribery law he has restrained the former shameful and discreditable ex- penditure on the part of candidates : and he has ordered them to invest a third part of their fortunes in real estate, deeming it disgraceful, as indeed it was, that those who sought honours should look upon Eome and Italy, not as their country, but as a kind of inn or hostelry, like so many people on their travels. There is consequently a rush of candidates ; they are bidding against each other for the purchase of whatever they hear is for sale, and in this way are the means of bringing fresh properties into the market. Accordingly, if you are tired of your farms iu Italy, this is the time for selling, as also, by Hercules, for buying in the provinces,* since these same candidates are selling there in order to buy here.</p><p>(20.)</p><p>To Tacitus.</p><p>You say that the letter I wrote you, at your request, on the subject of my uncle's death has made you wish to know what I myself, when left behind at Misenumfor with the mention of this I broke offhad to go through, not merely in the way of alarms, but of actual adventures. " Thougli memory shuns the theme, I will begin." f After the departure of my uncle, I devoted what time was left to study (it was for that purpose that I remained behind) ; the bath shortly followed, then dinner, then a short and troubled sleep. There had been heavings of the earth for many days before this, but they produced the less apprehension from being customary in Campania. On that night, however, they so much increased that every- thing seemed not so much to be in motion as to be turned upside down. My mother rushed into my room; I was similarly getting up with the intention of arousing her in case she were asleep. We sat down in a courtyard attached to the house, which separated by a small space the dwelling from the sea, I do not know whether to style it intrepidity or imprudence on my part, seeing that I was only in my eighteenth year ; however, I called for a volume of Livy, and read it as though quite at my ease, and even made extracts from it, as I had begun to do. Upon this, a friend of my uncle's, who had lately come to him from Spain, when he saw my mother and me seated, and me reading into the bargain, reproved her for her apathy and me for my insensibility to danger. None the less * In provinciis, in the Roman sense + The original is a quotation from as distinguished from Italy. J&lt;)ueid ii. 12. accipii.</p><p>BOOK VI. 197 diligently did I devote myself to my book. It was now seven o'clock in the morning, yet still there was but a kind of sickly and doubtful light ; now, too, that the sur- rounding buildings had been shaken, as the place in which we were, though not under cover, was of small dimensions, there was a great and unavoidable risk of our being over- whelmed. Then, at last, Ave decided on leaving the town. The mass of the inhabitants followed us terror-stricken, and (an effect of panic causing it to resemble prudence) preferring the guidance of others to their own, they pressed on us as we were making off, and impelled us forwards with their crowded ranks. When we had got beyond the buildings we stopped. There we experienced much that was strange, and many terrors. For the vehicles which we had ordered to be brought out, though standing on a per- fectly level plain, were rocking from one side to the other, and would not remain still in the same place even when propped under with stones. Moreover, we saw the sea sucked back into itself, and repulsed as it were by the quaking of the earth. The shore had certainly encroached on the sea, and retained a number of marine animals on its dry sands. On the other side of us a black and terrible cloud, broken, by the zig-zag and tremulous careerings of the fiery element, A^as parting asunder in long trains of flame : these were like lightning, but on a larger scale.</p><p>Then, indeed, the above-mentioned friend from Spain became more urgent and pressing.</p><p>" If," said he, " your brother and your uncle is alive, it is his wish that you should be in safety ; if he has perished, it xcas his wish that you should survive him. Why then hesitate to escape ? "</p><p>We replied that we could not so act as, while uncertain of his safety, to provide for our own. Without further delay he rushed off, and got out of reach of danger as fast as he could.</p><p>Not long after, the cloud in question descended on the earth and covered the sea. Already it had enveloped and hidden from view Caprese, and blotted out the promontory of Misenum. Upon this my mother begged and prayed and even ordered me to make my escape as best I could, it being in my power as a young man to do so ; as for lierself, retarded by her years and her frame, she was well content to die provided she had not been the cause of my death.</p><p>I, on the other hand, declared that I would not be saved except in her company, and clasping her hand I compelled her to quicken her pace. She obeyed with reluctance, blaming herself for delaying me. And now came a shower of ashes, though as yet but a thin one. I looked back : a dense mist was closing in behind us, and following us like a torrent as it streamed along the ground.</p><p>" Let us turn aside," said I, " while we can still see, lest we be thrown down in the road and trampled upon in the darkness by the crowd which accompanies us."</p><p>"We had scarcely sat down when night came on, not such as it is when there is no moon, or when there are clouds, but the night of a closed place with the lights put out.</p><p>One could hear the shrieks of the women, the cries for help of the children, the shouts of the men : some were calling for their parents, others for their young ones, others for their partners and recognising them by their voices. Some were lamenting their own case, others that of those dear to them. There were those who, through fear of death, invoked death. Many raised their hands to the gods, but the greater number concluded that there were no longer gods anywhere, and that the last eternal night of story had settled on the world. Nor were there wanting those who by imaginary and false alarms increased the real dangers. Some present announced that such and such a part of Misenum had been overthrown, or such another was in flames ;</p><p>falsely, yet to believing ears.</p><p>There was a little light again, but this seemed to us not so much day-light as a sign of approaching fire. Accord- ingly there was fire, but it stayed at a considerable distance from us, then darkness again and a thick and heavy .shower of ashes. We got up from time to time and shook BOOK VI. 201 these off us ; otherwise we should have been covered with them and even crushed by their weight. I might make a boast of not having suffered to escape me either a groan or a word lacking in fortitude, in the midst of such perils, were it not for the fact that I believed myself to be perishing in company with all things, and all things with me, a miserable and yet a mighty consolation in death.</p><p>At last, this black mist grew thin, and went off into a kind of smoke or haze ; soon came real day, and the sun even shone forth, luridly however, and with the appear- ance it usually wears under an eclipse. Our yet trembling eyes saw everything changed and covered with deep ashes as with snow. We returned to Misenum, and refreshed our persons as best we might, and there spent a night of suspense alternating between hope and fear. Fear pre- vailed, for the quaking of the earth continued, and many persons, crazy with terror, were sporting with their own and other's misfortunes by means of the most appalling predictions.</p><p>Yet not even then, after experiencing and still expecting perils, did we think of going away till news came of my uncle. All this, which is in no way worthy of history, will be for you to read, not to write about, and you must lay it to your own account (since it was you who called for the communication) if it should seem to you not even worthy of a letter.</p><p>(21.) To Caninius. / I am one of those who admire the ancients, yet I do not, like some, disparage the intellects of our own time.</p><p>For it is not true that nature, as though wearied and effete, no lunger produces anything worthy of admiration.</p><p>And indeed I lately heard Vergilius Paifus reading to a small company a comedy written after the model of the old comedy, and so well written that it may itself serve as a model some day. I do not know whether you are acquainted with the author, though you ought to be ; for he is a man of mark owing to his high character, his refined genius, and his versatility as a writer. He has written " Mimiambi " * with much delicacy, melody and grace, indeed masterpieces of their kind (for there is no kind of composition which, if carried to perfection, may not be styled a masterpiece) ; he has written comedies in imitation of Menander and other authors of the same age.</p><p>You might rank them among the works of Plautus and Terence. Now, for the first time, though not with the air of a beginner, he exhibits himself in the old comedy.</p><p>Vigour, grandeur, subtlety, pungency, sweetness, humour, none of these are wanting to him: he exalts virtue and lashes vice, employing fictitious names with good taste, and real ones with appropriateness. In my case only he has transgressed the bounds, through excess of complais- ance, except for this indeed that poets are licensed to fib.</p><p>To sum up, I shall squeeze the book out of him and send it to you to read, or rather to be learnt by heart, for I am sure you will not lay it down, if you once take it up.</p><p>(22.) To Tiro.</p><p>An affair has taken place, which is of importance to all those who are destined to govern provinces, and of importance too to those who trust implicitly in their friends.</p><p>Lustricius Bruttianus, having discovered Montanius Atti- cinus, one of his suite, in many delinquencies, reported liim to Csesar.</p><p>Atticinus added to his former delinquencies by accusing the man whom he had deceived. An in- vestigation was allowed, and I was among the assessors. Each party pleaded his own case ; in a summary way, * Mimic poems, in iambics.</p><p>BOOK VI.   203 however, and toucliing only on the heads, a method by which the truth is at once brought to light. Bruttianus produced his will, which he declared to have been written by the hand of Atticinus ; this showed the closeness of their intercourse and the necessity which had driven him to complain of one whom he had loved so dearly. He enumerated certain disgraceful and palpable offences ; which charges Atticinus, being unable to impair, retorted in such a way as to prove himself a mean knave by his defence and a scoundrel by his accusations.</p><p>For by bribing one of the secretaries' slaves, he had intercepted the Governor's official minutes and mutUated them, and now with consummate rascality was trying to turn his own crime to account against his friend. Csesar acted nobly.</p><p>He called for our verdicts, not on Bruttianus but forthwith on Atticinus.</p><p>The latter was convicted and banished to an island. Bruttianus received a perfectly merited acknowledgment of his integrity, and, in addition to this, obtained the credit due to his energy; for, after making short work of his own defence, he conducted his accusation with vigour, and showed that he was as spirited as he was good and honest.</p><p>This I have written to you by way of warning you beforehand, now that you have had a province allotted to you, to trust to yourself for the most part, and not put entire confidence in any one else. Next, you will learn, that should any one chance to deceive you (which may the gods avert !) satisfaction is provided you. Yet, again and again be careful that there may be no need of this ; for it is not so agreeable to be vindicated as it is miserable to be imposed upon.</p><p>(23.)</p><p>To Teiaeius.</p><p>You beg me urgently to undertake a case in which you are interested, and which, independently of this, is an important one, exciting public attention. I will do so, but not gratuitously.</p><p>" Can it be," say you, " that you won't act gratuitously ? " Yes, it can be ;</p><p>for I sliall exact a fee more creditable to me than if I held a brief for you gratis. I ask, and indeed stipulate, that Cremutius Euso shall be with me in the case. This is a practice of mine, and one which I have frequently followed before now in the case of several young men of distinction. For I am excessively anxious to exhibit young men of promise to the Courts, and to introduce them to fame. This service I ought to render to Euso, if to any one, whether on account of the nobility of his own birth, or else of the extraordinary regard he has for me; and I think it of great consequence that he should be seen and heard in the same cases, and moreover on the same side, as myself.</p><p>Oblige me then, oblige me, before he speaks ; for when he has once spoken, you will express your obligations. I guarantee that he will satisfy your anxieties and my hopes and the importance of the case. He has excellent qualities and will soon be bringing out other people, if meanwhile he be brought out by us. For indeed no man is gifted with a genius so immediately conspicuous as to be able to rise from obscurity, unless the materials, the opportunityay, and a patron too and one to recommend himfall to his lot.</p><p>(24.)</p><p>To Macee.</p><p>What a mighty difference it makes, hy whom a thing is done ! For deeds of the same character are either exalted to the highest pitch or sunk in the depths of oblivion according to the fame or the obscurity of the actors. I was sailing on our lake Larius,* when an elderly friend pointed out to me a villa and moreover a saloon projecting over the lake.</p><p>" From that spot," said he, " a townswoman * Now the Lago di Como.</p><p>BOOK VI.</p></div>

The husband had for a long time been an invalid, suffering from putrid ulcers in the groin* His wife insisted on seeing them ; no one (she said) could inform him more faithfully than she whether he was capable of being cured. She saw them and despaired. Next she advised him to die, and became herself his companion in death, nay rather his example and leader, the compelling cause of his death ; for she tied her husband to her, and jumped into the lake.</p><p>This exploit was never heard of till recently, even by me her townsman</p><p>; not because it was smaller than Arria's celebrated exploit,t but because the agent was a smaller person.</p><p>(25.)</p><p>To HiSPANUS.</p><p>You write word that Eobustus, a distinguished Eoman knight, got as far as Ocriculumto which point their road lay in commonwith Atilius Scaurus, a friend of mine, and that nothing further was heard of him. You wish for Scaurus to come and, if it be in his power, to put us on some track for inquiry. He shall come ; I fear to no purpose.</p><p>Indeed I suspect that something or other has befallen Eobustus, similar to what once befell Metilius Crispus, a townsman of mine. I had obtained for him his Company, and had further presented him at his departure with forty thousand sesterces | for his outfit and equip- ment ; I never, after this, got any letters from him or any news with regard to his end. Whether he was cut off by his slaves, or in company with his slaves, is a matter of doubt ; certainly neither he nor any of his slaves subse- quently appeared, as indeed none of Eobustus's have. We we must accord tins to your prayers and to those, so highly to be commended, of that excellent youth who is making inquiry for his father with such marvellous affection and marvellous sagacity as well. May the gods be favourable, so that he may discover the object of his search, in the same way as he already discovered the person in whose company he had been.</p><p>(26.)</p><p>To Servianus. I am delighted, and congratulate you, that you have betrothed your daughter to Fuscus Salinator. His family is patrician, his father a man of the highest character, and his mother of like repute. He himself is of a studious and literary turn, indeed learned, a boy in candour, a young man in geniality, an elder in seriousness. Nor does my love for him deceive me. I do love him, to be sure, with effusion (his attentions and his respect for me have de- served this), yet I exercise my judgment, and indeed the more stringently the more I love him ; and I guarantee to you, as one who have closely investigated liim, that you will have a son-in-law than whom your wishes could not have formed a better. All that remains is that he should, as soon as possible, make you the grandfather of young ones like himself. How happy the time, when it will be my good fortune to receive from your arms his children and your grandchildrenjust as if they were my own </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>207</head><p>Emperor* It is easy to find what to say, but by no means easy to make a selection ; so abundant is the material furnished by his virtues. However, I will write orwhich I should preferwill intimate to you my ideas by word of mouth, on condition of first exhibiting to you the causes of my hesitation. I am in doubt whether to advise you to do the same as I did. When Consul Elect, I abstained from all those usual topics which, though not flattery, would have borne the appearance of flattery ; not by way of showing my independence and fearlessness, but as understanding our Sovereign, whose greatest commendation I saw to be this, that nothing should be proposed by me in his honour, as though on compulsion. I remembered too that the most numerous honours had been conferred on the worst princes ; from whom our present excellent Sovereign could not be distinguished in any better way than by a different mode of speaking of him. This par- ticular point I did not disguise or pass in silence ; lest my treatment should haply seem due to forgetfulness instead of being the result of judgment. Such was my conduct on that occasion ; but the same course does not find favour with, is not indeed suitable to, all persons.</p><p>Moreover, the grounds for doing or not doing anything are altered according to the circumstances of the parties themselves, and the matters in hand, and the occasion.</p><p>For the recent achievements of our illustrious Prince furnish an opportunity of saying in the Senate much that is new and important as well as true. For which reasons, as I before said, I doubt whether to advise you to act now as I did then.</p><p>This, however, I have no doubt about, that it was my duty to offer for your consideration the course pursued by myself.</p><p>* Quid in honorem principis censeas. pected to make some complimentary The Cousul Elect when called on for remarks on the Sovereign, the first time for his vote was ex-2o8 PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>(28.) To Pontius.</p><p>I know the cause which prevented your arriving in Campania before me. But, albeit absent, you seem to have migrated here with all your possessions, such a plenty of town and country produce has been offered me in your name, all of which, though with great coolness, I have nevertheless accepted.</p><p>For not only did your servants beg me to do so, but I feared you would be angry with me and with them if I had not done so. Tor the future, if you don't put a limit to this, I shall. And already I have announced to your servants that, on their bringing so many things another time, they would have to take them all back again. You will say it behoves me to use what is yours as though it were my own. Certainly ; but I am for being just as careful of it as though it were my own.</p><p>(29-)</p><p>To QUADKATUS.</p><p>Avidius Quietus, who regarded me with particular affection and (I am no less glad to say) approval, used to relate many things of Thrasea, whose friend he had been, and among them frequently this. He was in the habit of laying it down that the causes to be undertaken were these : those of friends, those which could find no advocate, and those which pertained to example. The case of friends needs no explanation. Why such ^as could find no advocate ? Because in these the fearlessness as well as the kindliness of him who pleads them would be most strongly shown. Why those pertaining to example ?</p><p>Because it would make a great difference whether a good or a bad one were exhibited. To these categories of causes, though perhaps rather presumptuously, I must yet add such as are distinguished and conspicuous. For it is fair BOOK VI. 209 at times to plead the cause of glory and famein other words, one's own cause.</p><p>These are the limits which, since you have consulted me, I would impose on your sense of dignity and self- respect.</p><p>JSTor do I forget that practice is both held to be and is the best teacher of the art of speaking; indeed, I see many who, with small parts and no literature, have by dint of pleading attained to pleading well. Yet I also find that saying to be most true which has come to me as Pollio's, or under the name of PoUio : " Pleading well has been the cause of my pleading often, and pleading often the cause of my pleading less well ; " because, in fact, by too constant practice facility rather than a real faculty is acquired, and rashness rather than self-reliance. Nor, indeed, was Isocrates prevented from being held a consummate orator by the fact that the weakness of his voice and his shyness impeded him from speaking in public.</p><p>Accordingly read, write, and meditate a great deal, that you may be able to speak when you choose : you will speak when you ought so to choose. This is the mean which I myself have commonly preserved. Not unfre- quently I have yielded to necessity, which ranks as a reason.</p><p>Por I have pleaded certain causes by order of the Senate, in the number of which, however, were some which come under the above classification of Thrasea, that is to say, were such as to pertain to example. I appeared for the Bgetici against Bsebius Massa. The question was whether an investigation should be granted.</p><p>It was granted.</p><p>I appeared again on behalf of the same parties when they made plaint against Csecilius Classicus. The question was as to the propriety of punishing provincials as the associates and subordinate agents of a governor.</p><p>They suffered punishment. I prosecuted Marius Prisons, who was condemned in virtue of the law on extortion, and who profited by the clemency of that law, for by the enormity of his crimes he had outstripped its heaviest penalties.</p><p>He was banished. I defended Julius Bassus, who, thougli too unguarded and incautious, was by no means criminal.</p><p>Judges were assigned him, and he kept his place in the Senate. I spoke lately on behalf of Varenus, who demanded the right, equally with the other side, to com- pel the attendance of witnesses. He obtained it. For the future I pray that I may be ordered to plead those causes in particular which it would become me to undertake even of my own free will.</p><p>(30.)</p><p>To Fabatus, his Wife's Grandfather, "We are bound, by Hercules, to celebrate your birthdays in the same manner as our own, since the joy of ours de- pends on yours, and through your diligence and care we are happy here, and at our ease when with you.* The Camil- lianf villa, which you possess in Campania, has certainly suiTered from age : everything of value about it, however, either remains intact, or is very slightly injured. I will see then to restorations beim:' made on the most reasonable terms.</p><p>I seem to have many friends, but of that particular class whom you are in search of and the business demands, scarcely one ; for they are all men of the town, engaged in town pursuits : whereas for the manage- ment of country properties a rough-and-ready rustic sort of person is required, to whom this particular employment will not seem burdensome, nor the occupation one of petty interests, nor the solitude melancholy. You have a very favourable opinion of Rufus, as having been your son's friend.</p><p>What, however, he may be able to do for us there, I am not in a position to say. That he has the best intentions, I believe. Summoned by our emperor to act as his assessor at Centum Cellee* (that was the name of the place), I ex- perienced the greatest pleasure. What indeed can be more delightful than to enjoy a near view of the prince's equity, wisdom, and affability, and that too in his retire- ment, where these qualities best disclose themselves? The subjects of investigation were of various kinds, and such as to test the merits of the judge by the diversity of their character.</p><p>Claudius Ariston pleaded his cause, a leading citizen of Ephesus, a munificent man, seeking popularity by innocent means ; hence arose envy, and an informer was suborned against him by persons whose character was the opposite of his own. Accordingly he was acquitted, and received satisfaction.</p><p>Next day the case of Gallita was heard, who was charged with adultery. This lady, the wife of a military tribune and candidate for office, had stained her own and her husband's reputation by an amour with a centurion. The husband had written to the consular legate, and he to Csesar.</p><p>Csesar, after sifting the evidence, cashiered the centurion, and banished him into the bargain. There still remained a balance of punishment due to an offence which can only be committed by two persons. But the husband was kept back (not without incurring some censure for his forbearance) by his love for his wife, whom he had indeed kept in his house, even after information had been laid of the adultery, as though satisfied with having removed his rival.</p><p>Admonished that he must go through with his charge, he did so very unwillingly. However, her con- demnation was unavoidable, unwilling as the prosecutor might be. She was convicted, and left to the penalties of Now Civita Vecchia.</p><p>the Lex Julia. Csesar added to his judgment both the name of the centurion and a reference to military practice, that he might not seem to reserve for his own cognisance all cases of this kind.</p><p>On the third day an investigation was entered upon, which had been the subject of a great deal of talk and a variety of reports.</p><p>It related to some codicils of Julius Tiro, part of which were admitted to be genuine, while part were said to be forged. The persons indicted were Sempronius Senecio, a Eoman knight, and Eurythmus, Caesar's freedman and procurator. The heirs, while Csesar was in Dacia, had requested him in a joint letter to under- take the investigation. He had consented, and on his return had appointed a day ; and when some of the heirs, as if out of regard for Eurythmus, were for abandoning the prosecution, he had said most nobly, " Neither is he</p><p>Polyclitus, nor am I Nero." * However, he indulged them, at their request, with a delay, the period of which having expired, he now took his seat to hear the case. On the part of the heirs, two in all put in an appearance : they prayed either that the whole of the heirs should be compelled to act, since all had united in lodging the information, or that it might be permitted to them, as well as to the others, to withdraw from the suit. Csesar expressed himself with great wisdom and at the same time with great moderation; and when the advocate of Senecio and Eu- rythmus said that the accused would be left exposed to suspicion unless they were heard, " I care not," said he, ' whether they are left exposed to suspicions : but / am."</p><p>Then, turning to us, " You understand how we ought to act ; these people want to make it a ground of complaint that they have been allowed to withdraw from the prose- cution."! Then, pursuant to the decision of the Council, * Polyclitus was a freedman of +" If we allow them to retire from</p><p>Nero.

The loveliest of villas is surrounded by the most verdant fields : it borders on the shore, in the bight of which a harbour is at this moment being made. The left-hand mole of this is protected by the strongest works ; that on the right hand is under construction. In the mouth of the harbour an island* is rising, to confront and break the force of the sea carried in by the winds, and to afford an entrance to ships on either side. Its rise, moreover, is worth seeing, from the ingenuity displayed. Huge stones are brought in by ships of the largest burden ; these being thrown into the sea,t one upon another, remain fixed by their own weight, and are gradually constructed into a kind of rampart.</p><p>Its stony ridge already appears above the surface, scattering and throwing to a great height the waves which break on it.

This speech is on behalf of Attia Viriola, and is rendered remarkable by the station of the individual, the singularity of the case, and the im- portance of the decision. For, this lady, of lofty birth, married to a man of Praetorian rank, and disinherited by her octogenarian father within eleven days of the time when, smitten with love, he had brought home a step- mother for her, sought to recover her "paternal property by a process instituted before the four courts. One hundred and eighty judges sat (for so many are brought together in the four chambers) ; there was a vast crowd of assistants on either side, and the benches were thronged ; moreover a dense circle of spectators, consisting of many rows, encircled the spacious court. Add to this that the tribune was packed, and even in the galleries of the build- ins women as well as men were hangingr over in their eagerness to hear, which was difficult, and to see, which was easy.</p><p>Great was the expectation of fathers and daughters and even of stepmothers. The results which followed were various : for in two chambers we gained * The words in which Vulcan, in order to devote their attention to the the jEneid, bids the Cyclopes throw manufacture of arms for ^neas. aside what they were engaged on, in 2i6 PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>the verdict, in the same number we lost it.* Truly a notable and marvellous thing that in the same cause, before the same judges, with the same advocates and on the same occasion, so great a diversity should occur by chance, yet so as not to look like chance. The step- mother was beaten, who had herself been made heir to a sixth part of the fortune, and Suberinus f was beaten, who, after being disinherited by his own father, had with singular impudence claimed the property of another person's father, though he did not dare to sue for that of his own parent.</p><p>I have given you these details, first that you might learn from my letter what you could not have learnt from the speech, and secondly (for I will discover my arts) that you might have the greater pleasure in reading the speech, if you seemed to yourself not so much to be reading, as to be present at the trial. And though it be lengthy, I do not despair of its obtaining the same favour as a very short one. For its freshness is preserved by the abundance of the subject-matter, the niceness of the distinctions, by many short narratives and by the variety of the diction.</p><p>There are many passages in it (I should not dare say this save to you) of an elevated kind, many of an argumentative, and many too of a subtle character. For in the midst of the former powerful and lofty passages, the necessity often interposed itself of dealing with matters of account, and almost of calling for table and counters, so that a Centumviral trial became all of a sudden changed into the form * Everything connected with the got judgment in his favour on two court of the Centumviri is so obscure points and lost it on two others.

In short, some of our friends generally consider this speech as being the "Pro Ctesiphonte " of my speeches ; * whether truly, you will most easily judge, who have them all so well in your memory as to be able to compare them with this, while reading this alone.</p><p>(34.)</p><p>To Maximus.</p><p>You have acted rightly in promising a gladiatorial show to our friends at Verona, who have long loved and re- spected and honoured you.</p><p>And it was thence you obtained that wife who was so dear to you and so de- servedly appreciated ; to whose memory either a construc- tion of some kind was due, or else a spectacle, and such a one as this in preference to any other, as being most suited to a death-celebration.</p><p>Besides, you were entreated with so much unanimity that to refuse would have seemed not so much resolution as obstinacy. In this also you have acted admirably, in being so ready and liberal in furnishing the show ; for these are points too in which laro-e-mindness is shown. I could have wished that the panthers, of which you bought such numbers, had come to hand on the day appointed, but though tluy failed, from being detained by stress of weather, you at any rate deserved to get the credit of what it was no fault of yours that you did not exhibit. * Being to the rest of my orations of Ctesiphon is to hismy chcj what Demosthenes' speech on behalf d'osuvre, in fact.</p><p>( 2l8 ) BOOK VI I.</p><p>To Geminus.</p><p>The obstinacy of tliis illness of yours alarms me, and, though knowing how great is your self-control, I fear it may even affect your temper. Accordingly, I urge you to bear up against it with patience. This is the laudable, the wholesome course, and what I advise is within the power of human nature. For my part, at any rate, when in health, I am in the habit of dealing with my people after this fashion :</p><p>" It is assuredly my hope that, in case of falling sick, I shall desire nothing to be ashamed of or repented of ; yet, should the disease get the better of me, I warn you to give me nothing, except by permission of the doctors; and know that if you do give me anything, I shall punish the act in the same way as others punish a refusal to comply with their wishes." Moreover, on the occasion of my being burnt up by a raging fever, when, freed at last from the crisis and anointed, I received a drink from the doctor, I held out my pulse and bid him feel it, and thereupon gave back the cup which I had already raised to my lips. Afterwards, on the twentieth day of my illness, when I was being prepared for the bath, and noticed that the doctors were all of a sudden speaking together in an undertone, I inquired the reason. They replied that I might possibly bathe with safety, yet not altogether without some apprehension. "Where," said I, "is the necessity?" and so placidly and calmly laying aside all hope of the bath, which I had seemed on the point of being conveyed to, I composed my mind and my looks for the privation no less readily than just before for the bath.</p><p>BOOK VII.   219   All this I have written to you, firstly, that my warning might not be unaccompanied by an example, and next, that for the future I myself might be bound to the same course of self-control, through having engaged myself to it by this letter as by a kind of pledge.</p><p>(2.)

" Why," say you, "I myself am a Lucanian and my wife is a Campanian." Good grounds these for a more protracted absence from town ; but not, however, for an uninterrupted one.</p><p>Why not return then at some time to Eome, where consideration and honour and friendships, distinguished as well as humble, await you. How long will you continue to play the king, waking when you choose and sleeping as long as you choose ? How long are your dress-shoes to be nowhere, your toga to have a holiday, your whole day to be free ? It is time that you should revisit our worries, if with this object only, that those pleasures of yours may not languish through satiety. Pay your court to others for a brief while, that it may be the more agreeable to you to be courted in turn. Jostle in this crowd of ours, in order to enjoy solitude. But why foolishly retard him whom I am striving to recall ? For, perhaps, you will be urged by this very language of mine more and more to wrap your- self up in your ease, which I don't want to see broken up, but merely intermitted. For, just as if I were giving you a dinner I should intermingle with sweet dishes some that were sharp-flavoured and piquant, that your taste, deadened and cloyed by the former, might receive a fresh stimulus from the latter, so now I exhort you to season your most delectable mode of life now and then with, so to speak, a triflincT admixture of acids.</p><p>o (4.) To Pontius.</p><p>You say you have read my hendecasyllables ; you would even seek to know how it was that I began to write them, who am, in your estimation, a serious personage, and, as I myself admit, no trifler. I was at no time (to go back a long way) averse from the poetic art ; nay more, when fourteen years of age, I wrote a Greek tragedy.</p><p>" What sort of one ? " you ask. I can't say ; it was called a tragedy.</p><p>Afterwards, when, on my return from military service, I was detained by adverse winds in the island of Icaria, I wrote some Latin elegiacs on the sea there and the island itself. At times I have tried my hand at heroic metre ; now for the first time at hendecasyllables, which were originated and first saw the light in this wise. The chapters of Asinius Gallus on the comparison between his father and Cicero were being read to me at my house at Laurentum, when an epigram of Cicero on his favourite Tiro occurred. Afterwards, on retiring for a midday siesta (for it was summer time) when sleep failed to steal over BOOK VII.   221 me, I began to ponder how the greatest orators not only- esteemed this kind of literary effort as a recreation, but also took credit for it. I applied my mind, and, contrary to my expectation, after such long disuse, in a remarkably short space of time scribbled the following verses on the very subject which had induced me to write : -"When Gallus I read, who pretends that his sire Had far more than Tully poetical fire :</p><p>The wisest of men, I perceived, held it fit To temper his wisdom with love and with wit ;</p><p>For Tully, grave Tully, in amorous strains Of the frauds of his paramour Tiro complains ; That, faithless to love and to pleasure untrue, From his promised embrace the arch wanton withdrew ; Then I said to my heart, * Why should' st thou conceal The sweetest of passions, the love which you feel ?</p><p>Yes, fly, wanton Muse, and proclaim it around.</p><p>Thy Pliny has loved and his Tiro has found.' The coy one so artful, who sweetly denies.</p><p>And from the sweet flame, but to heighten it, flies." * I passed on to elegiacs ; these, too, I delivered myself of with no less celerity, and, corrupted by this facility, I added some iambics. Then, on my return to town, I read them to my friends. They approved them. Afterwards I attempted a variety of metres in my leisure moments, and principally when travelling. At last I determined, in accordance with the example set by many, to complete one separate volume of hendecasyllables, nor do I repent having done so. It is read, transcribed, indeed sung, and accompaniedby the Greeks, too, whom their relish for this little book has taught Latinsometimes on the guitar, at other times on the lyre. But why talk so big ? How- ever, poets are privileged to rave. And yet I do not speak from my own but from others' judgments, who, whether they judge rightly or wrongly, at any rate delight me. I only pray that posterity likewise may judge, whether rightly or wrongly, in the same way.</p><p>(5-)</p><p>To Calpuenia, his Wife.</p><p>It is incredible what a yearning for you possesses me.</p><p>The reason of this is first of all my love for you, and next that we have not been accustomed to be separated.</p><p>Hence it is that I spend a great part of my nights wake- ful over your image ; hence in the day, at the times when I was in the habit of looking in on you, my feet of their own accord take meas the phrase runs most trulyto your apartment ; hence in the end, sick at heart and sad, as one who has been denied admittance, I retire from the deserted threshold.</p><p>One time alone is free from these torments, that in which I am worn out in the Forum by the law-suits of my friends. It is for you to judge what my life must be when it finds its repose in labour, its solace in miseries and cares ! (6.) To Macrinus.</p><p>A strange and remarkable circumstance has happened to Varenus,* though it be still of an uncertain character.</p><p>The Bithynians are reported to have given up his prosecution on the ground of its having been undertaken without consideration. Eeported, do I say ? The agent of the province is here, and has brought a decree of its council to Csesar, to many of our leading men, and to us, the advocates of Varenus, into the bargain. Still, that same Magnus holds out ; more than this, he worries with the utmost pertinacity the worthy Nigrinus, through whom he made application to the consuls that Varenus should be ordered to produce his accounts. I assisted Varenus, but now only as a friend, having made up my mind to hold my tongue. For nothing could be more disadvan- * See Letters v. 20 and vi. 13. BOOK VIL 223 tageous than that I, appointed his advocate by the Senate, should defend, as though lying under an accusation, a person to whom it imported that he should appear not to be accused at all. However, when at the close of Nigri- nus's application the consuls turned their eyes towards me, " You will know," said I, " that I have good reason for my silence when you have heard the real agents of the pro- vince."</p><p>In answer to this, "To whom have they been sent ? " asked Nigrinus. Said I, " To tne, as well as to others.</p><p>I am in possession of the decree of the province."</p><p>To which he returned, " You may feel satisfied." I replied, " If you are satisfied the other way, it is possible that I, too, may be satisfied, and with better reason." Upon this the provincial agent, PolyjEuus, set forth the grounds for annulling the prosecution, and demanded that there should be no prejudgment of the matter in view of Cajsar's cog- nisance of it. Magnus spoke in reply, and Polysenus a second time. For my part, merely interspersing an occa- sional and brief remark, I observed in general a profound silence.</p><p>For I have learnt that there are times when it is no less the part of an orator to hold his tongue than to speak. And I can even remember that in the case of cer- tain persons capitally accused, I have served them still better by my silence than by the most elaborate oratory.</p><p>A mother who had lost her son (for what prohibits me, though my reason for writing this letter was a differ- ent one, from discussions of a professional kind?) accused to the prince his freedmen, who were also co-heirs with her, of forgery and poisoning, and obtained Julius Servianus for judge. I defended the accused, and that too in a very crowded court ; for the case attracted great notice, and, besides, the most celebrated talent was employed on either side.</p><p>The trial ended by the slaves being put to the question,* and the result was in favour of the accused.</p><p>Subsequently the mother applied to the prince, declaring that she had discovered fresh evidence. Suburanus was directed to hear the case thus decided, reargued, in the event of her producing any new matter. The mother's counsel was Julius Africanus, a grandson of that orator after hearing whom Passienus Crispus exclaimed, " Finely spoken, by Hercules, finely spoken ! But to what end all this fine speaking ? " This orator's grandson, a young man of talent, but not much judgment, after he had talked at great length and filled up the time allotted him, " I beg," said he, " Suburanus, that you would permit me to add just one word." Then I, when all were looking to me with the expectation of hearing a long reply, spoke thus, " I should have replied, if Africanus had added just that ' one word,' which, I doubt not, would have contained all his new matter."</p><p>I cannot readily call to mind having ever ob- tained so much approval by speaking, as I did then by not speaking.</p><p>Similarly on the present occasion I was lauded and welcomed for having so far held my tongue on behalf of Varenus.* The consuls, in accordance with the appli- cation of Polysenus, have kept the whole matter open for the prince, whose decision I await in suspense. For, the day when it is given will either put us at rest and at ease for Varenus, or will force us to resume our in- terrupted labours with renewed anxiety.</p><p>{?)</p><p>To Satueninus.</p><p>I thanked our friend Prisons lately, and have done so againsince you so bade mewith the greatest pleasure.</p><p>It is indeed particularly delightful to me that two such excellent men and dear friends of mine should be so knit together as to think yourselves under a reciprocal obliga- tion.</p><p>For he, too, professes to derive the highest gratifi- cation from your intimacy, and engages with you in a truly noble contest of mutual affection, which time itself * Eactenns tacui.</p><p>Keil reads hactenus non tacui, which gives a very forced sense.</p><p>BOOK VII.</p></div>

It will be particularly profitable and so it is laid down by many -to translate either from Greek into Latin, or from Latin into Greek. This is a kind of exercise which will furnish you with propriety and brilliancy of expression, a great supply of ornamental</p><p>turns, force in exposition, and, moreover, by imitation of the best models, a faculty of inventing what will resemble them. At the same time, what might have eluded the notice of a reader cannot escape a translator. By this means taste and judgment are acquired. It will do you no harm iftaking what you have read with sufficient atten- p PLINY S LETTERS. tion to recollect the matter and the argumentyou write down the substance in a spirit of rivalry, and then compare it with what you have read, carefully considering what you and what your author have put in a preferable way. Great will be your joy if you have bettered him in some places; great your shame if he has bettered you in every- thing. It will sometimes be permissible to select the best known parts, and to compete with the choicest passages. This contest, though a daring one, will not be impertinent, because it is carried on in private. Though, for the matter of that, we see many who have undertaken this kind of competition with great credit, and who, by reason of not despairing, have outstripped those whom they thought it sufficient to follow in the wake of. You may also take in hand again what you have written, after you have forgotten it, and then retain much of it, throw out more, insert some things, and rewrite others.</p><p>This is an irksome and extremely tedious task, but which the difficulty itself renders profitableto warm to one's work afresh, and resume one's swing after it has been enfeebled and has ceased, and, finally, to insert fresh members, so to speak, in a completed framework, yet so as not to disturb what was there before. I know that just now you have a particular affection for oratory, but I would not on that account advise you always to adopt that contentious, ar\d, if I may so term it, warlike style.</p><p>For as soils are refreshed by varying and changing the seeds, so are our minds by exercising the thoughts now in one direction, now in another. I should wish you occasionally to take up some historical topic. I should a' so wish you to write a letter with especial pains, Eor oftentimes, even in an oration, a necessity occurs, not only for historical, but almost for poetical treatment, and a concise and pure style is acquired by letter-writing. Even poetry is a fitting relaxation, I don't say long and sustained poems (for such as these can only be elaborated with full leisure), but of that lively and short kind which BOOK VII.   227 form a suitable interruption to occupations and business, however important. We call them poetic sports. But these sports sometimes attain to no less fame than serious effusions.</p><p>Nay, more (for why should I not exhort you to verse-making by verse ?) : -As yielding wax the artist's skill commands, Submissive shaped beneath his forming hands ; Now dreadful stands in arms a Mars confessed, Or now with Veniis' softer air impressed ;</p><p>Now by the mould a wanton Cupid lies, j Now shines, severely chaste, a Pallas wise ;</p><p>As not alone to quench the sacred flame The sacred fountain pours her friendly stream, But sweetly gliding through the flowery green, Spreads glad refreshment o'er the smiling scene ; So, formed by science, should the ductile mind Receive, distinct, each various art refined.* And so the greatest orators, who were at the same time the greatest of men, either exercised or delighted them- selves, nay, rather both exercised and delighted themselves. For it is marvellous how, by means of these small com- positions, the mind is at once exerted and refreshed. There is room in them for love, hatred, wrath, pity, humour, everything, in short, which has a place in daily life, as well as in the Forum and its trials. There is in these, too, the same advantage as in other kinds of poetry, that, after acquitting ourselves of the necessities imposed by metre, we learn to rejoice in the freedom of prose, and that which comparison shows to be the easier for us we write with all the more pleasure.</p><p>You have now got, perhaps, even more than you required.</p><p>One thing, however, has been omitted, for 1 have not said what I thought you ought to read, and yet I did say it when telling you what ought to be written. Do you mind and make a careful selection of authors, each of his own kind. For they say that one ought to read much, not many things. "Who these authors are is so well-known and established that there is no necessity for pointing them out ; and, independently of this, I have so immoderately extended this letter, that, while advising you on the way in which you ought to conduct your studies, I have been robbing you of time for study.</p><p>Eesume, then, your note-books, and either write something in accordance with these suggestions, or go on with the particular work you had begun.</p><p>(lO.)</p><p>To Macrinus.</p><p>As I myself, when I have learnt the beginning of a story, long to tack to it the ending, which has in a manner been forcibly separated from it, so I suppose that you too would like to learn the remainder about Varenus and the Bithynians.*</p><p>The cause was pleaded by Polysenus on one side, and Magnus on the other. At the conclusion of their speeches, " Neither party," said Caesar, " shall have to complain of delay ; it shall be my care to ascertain the wishes of the province." Meanwhile Varenus has obtained a good deal. For, indeed, how doubtful it must be whether a man is rightly accused, when it is uncertain whether he be accused at all? All that remains is that the province should not once more approve of what it is said to have condemned, and thus repent of its own repentance.</p><p>(II.)</p><p>To Fabatus, his Wife's Geandfather.</p><p>You are surprised that Hermes, my freedman, should have sold to Corellia the five-twelfth share which was left me in an estate (without waiting for the auction, though I had ordered the property to be advertised), at the rate of * See Letter 6 of this Book.</p><p>BOOK VII.</p></div>

Ties of long standing unite me to her husband also, Minicius Justus, a man of the loftiest character, and very strong ones united me to her son, to such an extent indeed that, during my Prsetorship, he presided at the shows which I gave. Corellia, when I was lately in those parts, intimated to me her desire to own some property upon our Larian lake. I offered her, out of my estates, anything she liked, at her own price, always excepting what had come to me from my mother and father, for I could not part with these, even to Corellia.

And this makes me wonder the more at your writing that there have been some who blamed me for reciting my orations at allunless, indeed they think that these are the only compositions which' need no correction.</p><p>Qf these people I should be glad to inquire why they admit (if, however, they do admit) that a history ought to be recited, which is composed, not with a view to display, but to fidelity and truth ?</p><p>Or why a tragedy, which requires, not a recitation chamber, but a stage and actors ? Or why lyric poetry, which requires, not a reader, but the chorus and the lyre ? "</p><p>Oh, but the recitation of these kind of things is now a received usage." Pray, then, is the person to be blamed who originated it ?</p><p>Though, by the way, orations too have often been read aloud both by our countrymen and by the Greeks. " At any rate, it is a work of supererogation to recite what you have already spoken." Granted, if you recite exactly the same thing, to precisely the same people, without a moment's delay.</p><p>If, however, you make many additions and many changes, if you invite to hear you some fresh people, together with some of those who have heard you before (after an interval, however), why should your reasons for reading aloud what you have already spoken be less acceptable than for publishing the same ? " But it is difficult for an oration to give satisfaction when recited." PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>"Well, but this is a point which concerns the pains taken by the reciter, not the reasons for not reciting.</p><p>Nor, indeed, do I seek approval while reciting, but while being read.</p><p>Consequently, I neglect no means of improvement. First of all, I go carefully over what I have written by myself ; next I read it to two or three people ; then I hand it over to others to make their notes on it, and these notes, when in any doubt, I again ponder in company with one or other of them. Last of all, I recite to a larger audience, and, if you will believe me, then it is that I am keenest at correcting ; for the ardour of my application is proportioned to my anxiety. Indeed, respect for one's audience and a sense of diffidence are the best of critics. Take it in this way : are you not less perturbed if you are going to address some one person, who, however great his culture, is still a single individual, than if you are going to address a number of people, even though they be uncultured? Do you not, on ris- ing to plead, nlistrust yourself, particularly at that moment ; at that moment desire, not merely that many things, but that everything in your speech could be changed ? And that still more strongly if the scene be enlarged and the circle of hearers extended ? For we look with apprehension even upon the common folk in their dusky attire. Are you notif you fancy any part of your opening to be unfavourably receivedat once discouraged and prostrated ? I presume this is because, in numbers themselves, there is a certain weighty and collective judgment ; and while each indivi- dual has but a small critical faculty, yet, taken altogether, they have a great deal. Hence Pomponius Secundushe was a writer of tragediesif there chanced to be any passage which one of his intimate friends thought of a nature to be left out, while he himself thought it should be retained, used to say, " I appeal to the public ! " And accordingly, judging from the silence or the approval of the public, he followed either his own or his friend's opinion.</p><p>Such importance did he attach to this same public ; rightly or wrongly, does not concern me j for it is BOOK VII. 235 not my custom to invite the public, but persons I am sure of and have selected, whom I can look at and trust, whom I can scrutinise singly, and stand in awe of collectively. For M. Cicero's opinion about the pen I hold with regard to fear.</p><p>Apprehension is the sharpest corrector. The very fact that we reflect we are about to recite acts as a corrector ; our entrance into the audience-room, the act of growing pale, our shivering, our looking about us, all these are so many correctors.</p><p>Consequently, I am not ashamed of my habit, which experience shows me to be a most useful one, and, so far from being deterred by these people's tittle-tattle, I will go further, and ask you if you can tell me of anything to be added to all this. Nothing, indeed, will satisfy my precautions ; for I reflect what an important matter it is to deliver anything into the hands of men ; and I cannot persuade myself that it is not proper to revise often, and in the company of many, that which one desires should give pleasure at all times and to all people.</p><p>(18.) To Caninius.</p><p>You ask my opinion in what way the money which you have offered to our townsfolk for an annual feast may be secured after your decease. While the inquiry does you honour, the decision is not an easy one. Suppose you pay the amount to the municipality? It is to be feared that it may be squandered. Suppose you give land ? Being public land, it will be neglected. For my part, I can find nothing better than what I did myself. In lieu of five hundred thousand sesterces,* which I had promised for the maintenance of free boys and girls, I made over to the agent of the public property some lands of mine of much greater value ; these I had reconveyed to me on condition of paying thirty thousand sesterces f * About £4cxx&gt;. See Book i. Letter 8.</p><p>f About £240.</p><p>annually as a rent-charge. In this way the capital of the municipality was made safe and the income was assured ;</p><p>the land itself, in consequence of there being a large margin over the rent-charge, will always find an owner to cultivate it. I am aware that this cost me something more than the amount of my nominal donation, as the lien of the rent-charge has diminished the selling price of a very handsome property. But one is bound to prefer public to private interests, those that are enduring to those that are mortal, and to be much more careful in securing one's benefactions than one's property.</p><p>(19.)</p><p>To Pkiscus.</p><p>The illness of Fannia torments me. She contracted it while nursing Junia the vestal virgin, originally of her own accord (indeed they are related), and subsequently being further commissioned to do so by the Pontifices ; for the virgins, when compelled by violent disease to remove from the court of Vesta's temple, are handed over to the care and custody of married ladies. While Fannia was carefully discharging the office in question, she became involved in this peril. The attacks of fever stick to her, her cough grows upon her, she is in the highest degree emaciated and enfeebled. Only her great soul and spirit in every way worthy of her husband Helvidius and her father Thrasearetain their vigour ; all else is breaking up in such a way as to prostrate me not merely with appre- hension, but with grief as well. Indeed, I do grieve that such an illustrious woman should be snatched from the gaze of the country, which may perhaps never look upon</p><p>her like again. Oh, what purity was hers ! what holiness of life ! what nobility of character</p><p>! what intrepidity of soul ! Twice she followed her husband into exile, and a third time was herself banished on her husband's account ; for when Senecio was accused of having written certain BOOK VII.   237   publications on tlie life of Helvidius, and had said, in the course of his defence, that he had been requested to do so by Fanuia, upon Mettius Cams asking her, in a menacing tone,''</p><p>" whether she had so requested him," she replied, " I did make the request." "Had she furnished him with memoranda for the composition ?</p><p>" "I did furnish him."</p><p>" Was this with the knowledge of her mother ? " " Without her knowledge." In short, not a word did she utter that quailed before the peril. Moreover, she preserved copies of these very publications after the confiscation of her property (though through the exigencies and the terror of that epoch they had been suppressed by a decree of the Senate), kept them, and carried into her exile the cause of her exile.</p><p>At the same time she is so pleasant, she is so friendly, and, in shortthe privilege of but fewas lovable as she is venerable.</p><p>Will there be any woman left whom we may hereafter point out to our wives ? Will there be any one from whom we may take an example even of manly fortitude ? whom, while we still see her and hear her, we may admire as we do the women one reads about ?</p><p>Tor my part, it seems to me as though her very house were tottering and about to fall torn from its foundationsand this though she still has descendants.</p><p>For how great must be their virtues and how great their deeds in order to make it clear that she has not perished the last of her race ! And there is this additional cause of affliction and torment for me, that I seem to be losing her mother over againthat mother of such a woman ; what more illustrious name can I give her ?whom Fannia, as she resembles and recalls to us, so she will take away with her, afflicting me at one and the same time with a fresh and a re-opened wound. I frequented them both and cherished them both ; which of them in a greater degree I know not, nor did they desire that a difference should be made. They had my services in prosperity and they had them in adversity. I was their consoler when tliey -were banished and their avenger when they returned. Yet I did not fully acquit my debt to them, and for this reason am all the more anxious that Fannia should be spared in order that time may be left me for payment. Such are the cares amidst which I have written to you, and if any god shall turn them to joy, I will not complain of my fright. For not only is it my habit to tell the truth, but it is also yours to hear it willingly. Indeed, there are none who submit more patiently to correction than those who are most deserving of praise. And now, I am expecting from you my book with your notes. What a delightful and charming interchange ! How it rejoices me that, should posterity take any heed of us at all, it will be universally related in what concord, with what sincerity and fidelity to each other, we lived. It will be a rare and memorable thing for two men pretty nearly equals in points of age and station, and not altogether without a name in litera- ture (I am compelled, you see, to speak in somewhat scant terms of you as well, inasmuch as I am speaking of my- self at the same time), each to have furthered the studies of the other.</p><p>For my part, when I was but a stripling, while you were already flourishing in renown and glory, I yearned to follow after youboth to be accounted and to be " second to you, though great the space between." Yet there were in existence many men of brilKant genius ; nevertheless you seemed to me, owing to the similarity of our dispositions, to be the one most capable of being imitated, and most worthy of imitation.</p><p>I the more rejoice then that, whenever the conversation turns on BOOK VIL 239 intellectual pursuits, we are named together, that to people speaking about you my name at once presents itself.</p><p>Not but what there are some who are preferred to both of us. But it does not matter to me what place is assigned us, provided we are thus conjoined ; for in my estimation to come next to you is to be before all the rest.</p><p>Moreover, you must have noticed that in wills (unless a testator should happen to be especially intimate with one or the other of us) we receive the same bequests, and in each other's company. All which goes to this, that our mutual affection should be the more ardent when so many are the bonds which constrain us by our studies, our characters, our reputations, and, finally, by the last dis- positions of mankind.</p><p>(21.)</p><p>To COENUTTJS.</p><p>I am all obedience, my dearest colleague, and am attend- ing, as you bid me, to the weakness in my eyes. For I came here in a close carriage, shut in on all sides as in a bedroom, and am abstaining herewith difficulty, but still abstainingnot only from the use of my pen, but even from reading, and study only through my ears. By drawing a curtain, I cause my chamber to be shaded without being darkened. The cloister,* too, by covering up the lower part of the windows, enjoys as much shade as sun.</p><p>In this way I am carefully learning by degrees to bear the light.

Of illustrious birth and ample fortune, he is as much devoted to study as poor men are wont to be.* At the same time he is a most upright judge, a most undaunted advocate, and a most faithful friend.</p><p>You will think that a favour has been conferred on you when you have made more intimate acquaintance with a man who is at any rate equal (for I do not wish to speak too boastfully of one who is himself so modest) to any honours and to any titles.f <ref type="bibr">(23-)</ref> To Fabatus, his Wife's Geandfathek.</p><p>While I rejoice at your being strong enough to go and meet Tiro at Mediolanum,! yet that you may continue to preserve that strength, I would beg you not to impose on yourself so great a fatigue, which is opposed to the consideration of your time of life. Nay, further, I enjoin on you to wait for him at home, and, what is more, inside your house, and even inside your chamber. For truly, since he is cherished by me as a brother, he ought not to exact from one whom I look up to as a father an attention which he would have excused in the case of his own father. * i.e., as those who are required, on him, he will be found, if not by want of means, to labour at a pro-superior (for I don't wish to puff him fession.</p><p>unduly), at any rate equal to them. + The stress is on "equal" (jparem).</p><p>J Milan, See vii, i6.</p><p>"Whatever honours may be conferred BOOK VII.   241   (24-)   To Geminus, Ummidia Quadratilla is dead, wanting a little of eighty years, but hale up to the time of her last illness, and with a compactness and vigour of frame surpassing that of matrons in general. She died leaving a will which reflected great credit on her. She made her grandson heir to two-thirds, and her granddaughter to the remaining third of her fortune. The granddaughter I know hut slightly, the grandson I have the strongest regard fora youth of singular merit, and one who deserved to be loved as a relation by others besides his blood connections.</p><p>In the first place, though conspicuous for personal beauty, he escaped the gossip of the malevolent, both in boyhood and youth. In his four-and-twentieth year he was a husband, and, had the gods so willed it, would have become a father. In the society of a grandmother addicted to pleasure he lived a life of extreme steadiness, and yet of compliance with her wishes. She had pantomimists in her employ, and interested herself more warmly in them than became a woman of her high rank. Neither at the theatre nor at home did Quadratus witness the perform- ances of these men, and she did not require him to do so.</p><p>I have heard her say herself, when commending to me her grandson's studious pursuits, that being a woman, with that want of occupation which is the lot of the sex, she was in the habit of relieving her mind by a game of draughts, or by watching the performances of her panto- mimists ; but that whenever she was about to do either of these things she always bade her grandson go off to his studies ; and she seemed to me to do this from a sense of v/hat was due to the youth as much as from her love for him.</p><p>You will be astonished, and so was I. At the last sacerdotal games, a contest of pantomimists having been Q exhibited, as Quadratus and I were leaving the theatre together, said he to me, " Do you know that to-day is the first time I ever saw a freedman of my grandmother's dancing!" Thus the grandson. But, by Hercules, per- sons who were in no way connected with her, by way of doing honour to Quadratilla -I am ashamed of having said honourrather by way of discharging their office of toadieswere coursing about the theatre, and jumping and clapping their hands, and admiring and imitating every gesture for the benefit of their patroness, with an accompaniment of sing-song. And now these persons will receive the tiniest of legacies, as a gratuity for enacting the part of claqueurs, from an heir who was never a spec- tator of these performances.</p><p>I have told you all this, because, when anything fresh turns up, you are in general not indisposed to hear it ; next, because it is a pleasure to me to renew any subject of joy by writing about it. And I do joy in the family affection shown by the deceased and in the honour paid to so excellent a young man. I am delighted, too, that the house which formerly belonged to C. Cassius (the man who was the chief and founder of the Cassian school) should be in possession of an owner in no way his inferior.</p><p>Eor my friend Quadratus will worthily fill it and become it, and once more restore to it its ancient dignity, celebrity, and glory, since there will issue thence as great an orator as Cassius was a jurisconsult.</p><p>(25.) To EuFus.</p><p>What a number of learned men there are whom their own modesty or the stillness of their lives conceals and withdraws from fame ! Yet we, when about to speak or read in public, stand in apprehension of those only who advertise their learning, whereas such as hold their tongues show to advantage by their silent reverence for the noblest of pursuits. What I write is written from expe- rience.</p><p>Terentius Junior, after serving irreproachably in the army, in Equestrian grades,* and also as Procurator of the province of Narbonian Gaul, has retired to his estate, preferring the prof oundest retirement to the honours which awaited him. Having been invited to his house, I regarded him as a worthy paterfamilias and a diligent farmer, and was prepared to talk to him on subjects with which I supposed him to be conversant. Indeed, I had begun to do so, when he, with the most learned discourse, recalled me to literature. How neatly he always expresses him- self ! in what Latin, in what Greek ! He is so strong in both languages that he seems chiefly to excel in the one he happens to speak at the moment. How great his reading, how great his memory ! You would think he lived at Athens, not in a country-house. In short, he has added to my apprehensions by causing me to be nervous in the presence of these secluded and, so to speak, rough countryfolk no less than in that of those whom I know for men of extensive learning.</p><p>I advise you to the same effect. For just as in camps, so also in this literary arena of ours, there are a good many persons who, though not in uniform, will be found on a close inspection to be girded and armed, and that too wdth the sharpest of intellects.</p><p>(26.)</p><p>To Maximus.   The illness of a, certain friend lately reminded me that we are best while we are sick. For what sick man is tempted either by avarice or lust ? Such an one is not the slave of his amours, has no appetite for honours, is neglectful of riches, and holds the smallest portion of them for enough, seeing that he is about to part with it. Then he remembers that there are gods and that he is a man ; he envies no one, admires no one, despises no one ; not even to malicious gossip will he pay attention or find food in it.</p><p>His dreams are of baths and fountains. These form the sum of his anxieties, the sum of his aspirations ; he proposes to himself an easy and comfortable existence for the future, that is, a harmless and a happy one, if he has the luck to escape. What philosophers strive to teach with a multitude of words, and even in a multitude of volumes, I am able, therefore, to lay down for your benefit and my own thus briefly : in health we should continue to be such as, in sickness, we promise that we shall be.</p><p>(2;.)</p><p>To SUEA.</p><p>Our leisure furnishes me with the opportunity of learning from you, and you with that of instructing me. Accord- ingly, I particularly wish to know whether you think there exist such things as phantoms, possessing an appear- ance peculiar to themselves, and a certain supernatural power, or that mere empty delusions receive a shape from our fears. For my part, I am led to believe in their existence, especially by what I hear happened to Curtius Eufus. While still in humble circumstances and obscure, he was a hanger-on in the suite of the governor of Africa. While pacing the colonnade one afternoon, there appeared to him a female form of superhuman size and beauty.</p><p>She informed the terrified man that she was " Africa," and had come to foretell future events ; for that he would go to Eome, would fill offices of state there, and would even return to that same province with the highest powers, and die in it.</p><p>All which things were fulfilled. Moreover, as he touched at Carthage, and was disembarking from his ship, the same form is said to have presented itself to him on the shore. It is certain that, being seized with illness, BOOK VIL 245 and auguring the future from the past, and misfortune from his previous prosperity, he himself abandoned all hope of life, though none of those about him despaired.</p><p>Is not the following story again still more appalling and not less marvellous ? I will relate it as it was received by me : -There was at Athens a mansion, spacious and com- modious, but of evil repute and dangerous to health. In the dead of night there was a noise as of iron, and, if you listened more closely, a clanking of chains was heard, first of all from a distance, and afterwards hard by. Presently a spectre used to appear, an ancient man sinking with emaciation and squalor, with a long beard and bristly hair, wearing shackles on his legs and fetters on his hands, and shaking them.</p><p>Hence the inmates, by reason of their fears, passed miserable and horrible nights in sleeplessness. This want of sleep was followed by disease, and, their terrors increasing, by death.</p><p>For in the daytime as well, though the apparition had departed, yet a reminiscence of it flitted before their eyes, and their dread outlived its cause.</p><p>The mansion was accordingly deserted, and, con- demned to solitude, was entirely abandoned to the dread- ful ghost. . However, it was advertised, on the chance of some one, ignorant of the fearful curse attached to it, being willing to buy or to rent it, Athenodorus, the philosopher, came to Athens and read the advertisement. When he had been informed of the terms, which were so low as to appear suspicious, he made inquiries, and learnt the whole of the particulars. Yet none the less on that account, nay, all the more readily, did he rent the house.</p><p>As evening began to draw on, he ordered a sofa to be set for himself in the front part of the house, and called for his note-books, writing implements, and a light.</p><p>The whole of his servants he dismissed to the interior apartments, and for himself applied his soul, eyes, and hand to composition, that his mind might not, from want of occupation, picture to itself the phantoms of which he had heard, or any empty terrors. At the commencement there was the universal silence of night.</p><p>Soon the shaking of irons and the clanking of chains was heard, yet he never raised his eyes nor slackened his pen, but hardened his soul and deadened his ears by its help.</p><p>The noise grew and approached : now it seemed to be heard at the door, and next inside the door.</p><p>He looked round, beheld and recognised the figure he had been told of. It was standing and signalling to him with its finger, as though inviting him. He, in reply, made a sign with his hand that it should wait a moment, and applied himself afresh to his tablets and pen. Upon this the figure kept rattling its chains over his head as he wrote. On looking round again, he saw it making the same signal as before, and without delay took up a light and followed it.</p><p>It moved with a slow step, as though oppressed by its chains, and, after turning into the courtyard of the house, vanished suddenly and left his company.</p><p>On being thus left to himself, he marked the spot with some grass and leaves which he plucked. ISText day he applied to the magistrates, and urged them to have the spot in question dug up. There were found there some bones attached to and intermingled with fetters ; the body to which they had belonged, rotted away by time and the soil, had abandoned them thus naked and corroded to the chains. They were collected and interred at the public expense, and the house was ever afterwards free from the spirit, which had obtained due sepulture.</p><p>The above story I believe on the strength of those who affirm it.</p><p>What follows I am myself in a position to affirm to others.</p><p>I have a freedman, who is not without some knowledge of letters. A younger brother of his was sleeping with him in the same bed. The latter dreamt he saw some one sitting on the couch, who approached a pair of scissors to his head, and even cut the hair from the crown of it. When day dawned he was found to be cropped round the crown, and his locks were discovered BOOK VII. A lad of mine was sleeping, in company with several others, in the pages' apartment. There came through the windows (so he tells the story) two figures in white tunics, who cut his hair as he lay, and departed the way they came. In his case, too, daylight exhibited him shorn, and his locks scattered around.</p><p>Nothing remarkable followed, except, perhaps, this, that I was not brought under accusa- tion, as I should have been, if Domitian (in whose reign these events happened) had lived longer. For in his desk was found an information against me which had been presented by Carus ; from which circumstance it may be conjecturedinasmuch as it is the custom of accused persons to let their hair grow that the cutting off of my slaves' hair was a sign of the danger which threatened me being averted. I beg, then, that you will apply your great learning to this subject.</p><p>The matter is one which deserves long and deep consideration on your part ; nor am I, for my part, undeserving of having the fruits of your wisdom imparted to me. You may even argue on both sides (as your w^ay is), provided you argue more forcibly on one side than the other, so as not to dismiss me in suspense and anxiety, when the very cause of my consulting you has been to have my doubts put an end to.</p><p>(28.)</p><p>To Septicius.</p><p>You say that certain folks have been finding fault with me in your presence, on the ground of my praising my friends immoderately at every opportunity.</p><p>I plead guilty to the charge, and even hug it to my breast. What indeed can be more to one's credit than the sin of good- nature ? Yet who are these people who know my friends better than I do ? However, suppose they do so know them, why grudge me a deception which is the cause of so much happiness to me ? Tor though these friends be not such as they are proclaimed by me, yet I am fortunate in that they seem such to me. Let these persons, then, transfer their mischievous assiduities elsewhere. There is no lack of those who malign their friends under the plea of criticising them, ife they will never persuade to think that my friends are too much loved by me.</p><p>(29-)</p><p>To MONTANUS.</p><p>You will laugh, then you will be indignant, then you will laugh again, when you read what, unless you do read it, you never will believe. There stands on the road to Tibur, this side of the first milestone -I noticed it quite latelya monument to Pallas,* thus inscribed : " To him, the Senate, on account of his faithfulness and loyalty to his patrons, decreed the Praetorian insignia and a sum of fifteen million sesterces.f He was contented with the honour merely." In truth, I have never marvelled to see honours bestowed more frequently by fortune than by discernment; yet this inscription strongly reminded me how farcical and foolish are those which are at times thrown away on such dirt and filth as this ; honours which, to crown the matter, this gallows-bird was impudent enough both to accept and to decline, and even, as a sample of modesty, to exhibit to posterity. But why this indignation ? It is better to laugh, that these rogues may not fancy they have achieved any mighty result, when their good luck has merely carried them to the point of being subjects for laughter.</p><p>* A freedman and favourite of the Emperor Claudius.</p><p>t About £120,000.

It is true that I had the latter in my hands while engaged in composing the former; not with the view of rivalling it (that would have been impudence, and almost madness) ; yet, at any rate, with the view of imitating and following it, as far as the divergence be- tween the two intellectsbetween a very great and a very small oneand the different character of my case would permit. <ref type="bibr">(31.)</ref> To COENUTUS.</p><p>Claudius Pollio desires your affection, and deserves it from the very fact that he desires it, and next because he 2SO PLINY'S LETTERS. loves you of liis own accord.

I had sold my vintages to certain dealers, who had bought them after a competition.</p><p>They were attracted by the actual, as compared with the prospective price, and their expectations deceived them. The simple course was to make an equal remission all round ; but this would have been hardly fair. Now to me it seems in the highest degree excellent, as abroad so at liome, as in great things so in small, as in things foreign so in one's own, to be diligent in the practice of equity.</p><p>For if our sins be all of equal importance, so must our good deeds be.* Accordingly, I remitted an eighth part of the purchase-money, and that to all, "that none should leave without my bounty feeling ; " f next, I had regard, separately, for those who had invested the largest sums in their purchases, for these had at the same time profited me more, and themselves suffered a greater loss.</p><p>Hence, in the case of those who had bought for more than ten thousand sesterces,| to the above eighth part, which was common to all, and, so to speak, a public gift, I added a tenth part of the amount by which they had exceeded the ten thousand. I am afraid that I have not made myself sufficiently intelligible, and will explain my way of reckoning more clearly. Suppose any persons to have bought for fifteen thousand, § these would have got back not only an eighth of fifteen thousand, but a tenth of five thousand. Further, on reflecting that some had paid me a considerable portion of what they owed, others a trifle, others nothing at all, it seemed to me by no means just that those who were not on a level in the discharge of their obligations should be put on a level in regard to the favour of abatement.|| So, again, I remitted to those who had made payments a tenth part of that which they had paid.</p><p>For this seemed the most fitting means, with reference to the past, of requiting them singly, in proportion to the deserts of each; and, with reference to the future, of enticing them not only to buy but to make payment. This calculation of mine, or this act of complaisance (whichever it may have been), cost me a large sum, but it was worth the outlay. For, through- out the whole district, both the novelty of this remission, and also its form, are applauded. Even the people them- selves, whom I treated, as the saying goes, not with one and the same measuring-rule, but with distinctions and gradations, left me all the more obliged to me, in pro- portion to the rectitude and probity of each, having experi- enced that it is not with me that -" The good and bad an equal honour find." * (3-)</p><p>To Spaesus.</p><p>You intimate that the book I last sent you is of all my works the one which pleases you most.

You will tell of new rivers set flowing over the earth,* new bridges thrown over rivers, mountain precipices occupied by camps, of a king who had despaired of nothing driven out of his palace, ay, and driven out of his life ; besides this, of triumphs twice celebrated, one having been the first over a hitherto unconquered people, the other, the last.</p><p>The single drawback, yet an important one, is, that to equal all this in description must be an immense and arduous task even for your genius, rising though it does to the loftiest heights, and growing in proportion to the vastness of its undertakings. And there must be not a little labour in this too, in preventing barbarous and savage names (among the first, that of the King himself)</p><p>from showing their repugnance to Greek metre. But there is nothing which skill and attention will not mitigate, even though they may fail to overcome it. Moreover, if it is permitted to Homer to contract, lengthen, and alter names, both soft and Greek, to suit the smoothness of his verse, why should not a similar licence be permitted to you, particularly when it results not from affectation but from necessity ? Accordingly, poet-fashion, having in- voked the godsand among them limi whose acts and works and counsels you are about to relateloosen your ropes, spread your sails, and be carried on (if ever you have been) by the full force of your genius !

To MONTANUS.</p><p>You must have learnt by this time from my letter how I lately remarked a monument to Pallas with this inscription on it : " To him the Senate, on account of his faithfulness and loyalty to his patrons, decreed the PrjE- torian insignia and a sum of fifteen million sesterces. He was contented with the honour merely.* Subsequently it seemed to me worth while to hunt up the decree itself.</p><p>I found it, and it was so verbose and extravagant, that the above extremely fulsome inscription seems modest and even humble by its side. Let -I will not say the African! and Achaici and Numantini of old -^but the men that are near to us, the Marii, Sullas, Pompeys (I will go no further),let these compare themselves with Pallas, and they will fall short of the praises accorded to him. Am I to suppose the men who thus decreed to have been humourists, or cravens ? I would call them humourists if such humour became a Senate. Cravens, then ? But no one is in such a craven condition that he can be forced to such acts. Was the cause, then, ambition and the yearn- ing for advancement ? But who so demented as to wish for advancement at the price of his own and the public disgrace, in a society where the advantage to be derived from the loftiest dignity should consist in being able to take the lead ineulogising Pallas in the Senate ? I pass by the circumstance that the Prsetorian insignia are offered to Pallas, though a slave, inasmuch as they are offered by slaves. I pass by their decreeing " tliat he should not only be exhorted, but actually compelled to the use of golden rings ; " for it was opposed to the august dignity of the Senate for a man of Prcetorian rank to wear iron ones These are trifling matters, which may be passed over.</p><p>But this is noteworthy, that "on account of Pallas the * See Book vii. Letter 29. 26o PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>Senate " (and the Senate-house was not purified after this !) -" on Pallas's account tlie Senate returns thanks to Caesar, in that his highness himself has bestowed the most honorable mention on him, and has also accorded to the Senate the faculty of testifying towards him its good will."</p><p>What indeed could be more glorious for the Senate than that it should appear sufficiently grateful to Pallas ? This is added : " That Pallas, to whom all of them, to the best of each man's abilities, confess their obligations, may enjoy, as he so richly deserves to do, the fruits of his matchless integrity and his matchless energy." You would suppose that the limits of the Empire had been extended, that armies had been rescued for the State. To this is tacked on, "Inasmuch as to the Senate and the people no more agreeable occasion for their liberality could be exhibited than the good fortune of being able to add to the means of so disinterested and faithful a guardian of the prince's revenues."</p><p>This was at that time the aspiration of the Senate, this was the chief delight of the people, this was the most agreeable occasion for liberality: to have the good fortune to add to the means of Pallas by squandering the public revenues ! See what follows : " That it had been the wish of the Senate, for its part, to decree to him a sfift of fifteen million sesterces out of the treasury, and the more his mind was remote from desires of this kind, the more earnestly did they pray the Father of the State to compel him to yield to the Senate." This, to be sure, was alone wanting : that Pallas should be dealt with by public authority ; that Pallas in person should be entreated to yield to the Senate ; that Caesar himself should be called in to plead against this arrogant self-denial, and to prevent his spurning the fifteen million sesterces.</p><p>Spurn them he didthe only way in which, after the public offer to him of so vast a sum, he could show his arrogance still more than by accepting it. Yet the Senate, in a tone of complaint, praised even this act in the following words : " But inasmuch as the most BOOK VIIL 261 excellent Prince and Father of the State, at the request of Pallas, has willed that that portion of the decree which related to the grant to him out of the treasury of fifteen million sesterces should he annulled ; the Senate hereby witnessed, that albeit it had of its own good will, and in accordance with his merits, initiated a decree of the above sum, among the other honours, to Pallas on account of his integrity and diligence ; yet, as they do not deem it lawful to set themselves against the will of their prince in.</p><p>any matter, so in this matter too they submit themselves to it."</p><p>Picture to yourself Pallas interposing his veto, as it were, on the decree of the Senate, and restricting the honours paid to himself ; refusing the fifteen millions as too much, after accepting the Prtetorian insignia as of smaller account. Picture to yourself Csssar complying with the prayers, or rather the commands, of his freed- man in presence of the Senate, for the freedman commands his patron when he is able to petition him in the Senate.</p><p>Picture to yourself the Senate continually witnessing that it had initiated a decree of this sum, among the other honours, to Pallas, in accordance with his merits and its good will, and that it would have persevered in its inten- tion if it had not been for its compliance with the prince's will, which it was not lawful to set one's self against in any matter. So then, in order that Pallas should not carry off the fifteen millions from the treasury, his own modesty and the compliance of the Senate were requisite, which latter, in this particular case, would not have complied if they had thought it lawful not to comply in any matter whatever. Do you think this is the end ? Wait a bit and hear something still stronger.</p><p>"And inasmuch as it is of advantage that the gracious disposition of the prince, ever prompt to honour and reward the deserving, should be everywhere exhibited to view, and chiefly in those places where the persons charged with the administration of his affairs may be stimulated to imitation, and where the highly proved faithfulness and integrity of Pallas may by his example provoke a zeal for laudable emulation ; the message read by the most excellent prince before this most honourable house on the tenth day before the Kalends of February last past, together with the decrees passed by the Senate on these matters, shall be inscribed on brass, and the brass in question shall be affixed to the statue in armour of the late Emperor Julius." It did not seem enough that the Senate-house should witness such disgraceful proceedings ; a place of great resort was selected for publishing them, where contemporaries should read them, and posterity as well. It was decided that the brass should be inscribed with all the honours of this haughty slave, both those wliich he repudiated and those which (as far as those who decreed them were concerned) he had borne.* The Praetorian insignia of Pallas were cut and carved on public and enduring monuments, just for all the world like ancient treaties, just like sacred laws ! Such was thehow to name the quality I know not -of the prince, of the Senate, of Pallas himself, that they wished to have affixed before the eyes of all, Pallas his impudence, Cassar his submissiveness, the Senate its base- ness.</p><p>Nor was there any shame felt in veiling this in- famy with a show of reasonan exquisite and admirable reason to be sure !that on the strenoth of the rewards o bestowed on Pallas the others might be provoked to the zeal of emulation ! So cheap were honours held, even those which Pallas did not disdain.</p><p>Yet there were found persons of respectable birth who sought for and deshed what they saw given to a freedman and held out to slaves.</p><p>How glad I am that I did not fall upon those times, of which I am just as much ashamed as if I had y\ lived in them.

If you have not as yetand I fancy you have not, for otherwise you would have told me of itgo and see what I (and I am ashamed of having been so slow about it) lately saw. There rises a hill of moderate size, wooded and shaded by ancient cypresses, at the base of which the spring emerges, forced out through many * Num potui longius hyperhaton sent your book,' wliicli are awkwardly facere ?</p><p>but unequal channels, and after struggling tlirougli a troubled pool of its own formation, opens out to tlie view with broad expanse, clear and transparent, so that you are able to count the small coins thrown into it and the glistening pebbles.</p><p>Thence it is impelled, not by the slope of the ground, but by its own very abundance, and, as it were, weight; now but a source, now already a noble river, and one actually capable of bearing ships, which, even when they come in opposite directions, and with contrary effort are holding a different course, it suffers to pass each other, and carries on their way. Such is the strength and rapidity of its current, though over a plane surface, that it is not assisted by oars, and, when it is faced, it is only with extreme difficulty that it can be overcome by oars or punt-poles. It is an agreeable change for those who are afloat for sport and pastime to vary toil by repose or repose by toil, according as they shift their course.</p><p>The banks are clothed with a quantity of ashes and poplars, which the transparent river reflects in succes- sion by so many green images, just as though they were submerged in it. The coldness of the water might vie with that of snow, and its colour does not yield to that of snow.</p><p>Hard by is a temple ancient and venerable. Clitumnus stands there in person, clothed and adorned with the prse- texta. Oracular responses indicate the prophetic power in addition to the presence of tlie divinity. Scattered around are a number of chapels and as many gods. Each of these has his own worship and his own name, some of them even their own springs. For besides that spring, which is, as it were, the parent of the rest, there are smaller ones, separated from the fountain-head, but never- theless flowing into the river, which is spanned by a bridge.</p></div>

She has expiated her mistake at the expense of a great lesson, having been brought into extreme peril.</p><p>Hence, while you must necessarily be grieved at your old age being deprived of descendants, who had been, so to speak, prepared for you, yet you ought, at the same time, to thank the gods who refuse you great-grandchildren for the present, in such a way as to preserve the life of your granddaughter, and who will yet bestow on you those great-grandchildren, the expectation of whom is made surer by this very fruitfulness of my wife, though, to be sure, it has been ascertained under rather unfavourable circumstances.</p><p>I am now exhorting, admonishing, and confirming you by the same methods as I employ towards myself.

And yet I am apprehensive that, even after rejoicing, you will return to your fears ; that, while delighted at Calpurnia's being freed from peril, you will shudder at the same time at her having been imperilled. She is cheerful noiv, and restored to herself and to me ; she begins to regain strength, and by her progress towards recovery to measure the crisis she has passed through. She was, in fact,* in the most critical condition (this be said without evil I BOOK VIIL 267 omen !), through no personal fault, rather through some fault due to her age. Hence her miscarriage, and the sad proofs of an unsuspected pregnancy. Accordingly, though it has not been your good fortune to assuage your regret for your lost brother by means of a grandson or grand- daughter of his, yet remember that is a blessing which is delayed rather than denied, since she is safe from whom we may hope for it. At the same time excuse to your father a mishap which women are always more prepared to look on with indulgence.</p><p>(12.)</p><p>To MiNICIANUS.   I must beg to be excused for just this one day. Titinius Capito is going to recite, and I hardly know whether it be more my duty or my desire to hear him. He is an excellent man, and one to be numbered among the special illus- trations of our age; he cultivates literature, and loves, cherishes, and advances men of letters ; he is the port, the harbour, the place of refuge for a number of those who do anything in the way of composition ; an example to all ; lastly, a restorer and reformer of letters, which are now in their decline.</p><p>He lends his house to people who recite, and frequents audiencesand that not merely at his own abodewith rare good-nature ; me certainly, provided he is in town, he has never failed. Besides, the nobler the incentive to gratitude, the more shabby it would be not to show one's self grateful. Pray, if I were harassed by legal proceedings, should I consider myself bound to one who appeared to my recognisances ; and now, because all my business, all my care is with literature, shall I be less obliged to one who frequents me with so much assiduity, in a matter which, if not the only one, is certainly the most important one which can lay me under an obligation ? Yet, if I owed him no return, no mutual good office, so to speak, yet I should be attracted either by the genius of the man, wliicli is so admirable, so grand, so gentle even when most serious, or else by the noble character of his theme. He is writing of the deaths of illustrious men, and among them of some who were very dear to me.

Add to this, that it is difficult to retain what you Tiarn learnt unless you do practise it. Thus it happened that the restoration of liberty surprised us in an untrained and inexperienced condition, and, enflamed by her charms, we are obliged to do certain things before we are masters of them. On the other hand, it was the ancient usage that we should learn from our elders, not only through our ears, but through our eyes as well, what we ourselves should presently have to do, and, by a kind of succession, to hand down to our juniors. Hence strip- lings were forthwith inured to service in the camps, that they might be habituated to command by obedience, and to act the part of leaders while learning to follow. Hence such as were to be candidates for public offices stationed themselves by the doors of the Senate-house, and were spectators of the national council before becoming members of it.</p><p>Each had his own father for an instructor, or to him who had no father the oldest and most illustrious citizens stood in the place of one. What are the privileges of those who introduce motions, what the rights of those who pronounce on them, what the power of the magistrates, and the liberty accorded to the remaining Senators, where to yield and where to resist, what is the time for silence and what the limit of speech, how to distinguish between the parts of a conflicting proposition, how those who would add anything to a previous proposal may execute their purpose ; in short, the whole practice of the Senate was taught by example, the surest mode of instruction.</p><p>Yet we, when youths, were, to be sure, in the camps. Yes, but at a time when prowess was suspected and inactivity was prized ; when the leaders were without authority and the soldiers without shame ; when the supreme control was nowhere and obedience nowhere ; when all things were in a state of solution and confusion, and even inversion ; in short, of a character to be forgotten rather than remembered.</p><p>We also had a view of the Senate, but a cowering and speechless Senate, at a time when it was dangerous to speak according to one's wishes and vile to speak against them. What could be learnt at such a period ? and what could be the advantage of learning ? when the Senate was summoned either to fall into a profound sleep or to sanc- tion some atrocious villany, and, detained now for the purpose of exciting laughter, now for that of inflicting pain, pronounced decisions which were never serious, though oftentimes sad.</p><p>These same evils we witnessed and endured for many years after we had ourselves become senators and sharers in them, by which means our intellects were •permanently dulled, broken, and bruised. It is but a short time (every time is short in proportion as it is happy) since we have learnt with pleasure what we are, and can practise with pleasure what we know. And this gives me a greater right to ask, first, that you will pardon my mistake, if there be a mistake ; next, that you would apply to it your remedial learning, whose care it has always been to investigate con- stitutional in the same way as civil law, what is ancient in the same way as what is modern, what is rare equally with what is common. And indeed I am of opinion that the kind of point which I am submitting to you was either not very familiar, or else actually unknown in practice to those predecessors of ours whose constant and varied experience left them in ignorance of scarce anything. Hence, not only shall I be the more readily excused if I have chanced BOOK VIII. 27 I to trip, but you will be the more entitled to credit if you can instruct me on a point which it is uncertain to me whether you have studied.</p><p>The debate was about the freedmen of Afranius Dexter, the Consul, who had perished either by his own or his servants' hands, either through their crime or their obedience to liis commands, it is uncertain which. As to these persons, one senator (" Who ? " you ask. It was I ; but this is of no consequence) opined that, having been put to the question, they should be exempted from punishment ; a second, that they should be banished to an island ; a third, that they should suffer death. So great was the difference between these proposals, that they could only be taken singly. For what is there in common be- tween putting to death and banishing ? ISTothing more, by Hercules, than between banishing and acquitting. Though, to be sure, a proposal for acquitting is somewhat nearer to one for banishing than w^ould be a proposal for putting to death, since both the former leave life untouched, while the last takes it away. Yet, meanwhile, those who were for the punishment of death and those who were for banishment sat together, and by a temporary simulation deferred the discord which underlay their concord. I demanded that the proper number of these three proposi- tions should be established, and that two of them should not be joined together in a short truce. Hence I insisted that those who were for the infliction of the capital penalty should leave the side of those who were for banishment, and that those who were shortly about to differ among them- selves should not in the interim be united in opposition to the party who were for an acquittal ; because it was of very little consequence that they disagreed with the same proposal, seeing that they had previously agreed to diffe- rent ones.</p><p>This too seemed to me particularly strange, that while he who had pronounced for banishing the freedmen and inflicting the last penalty on the slaves had been compelled to divide his vote, yet he who was for punishing the freedmen with death should be told off amoncr those who were for banishins^t hem. For if it had been right that the proposition of one should be divided, as comprehending two different things, I could not dis- cover in what way the propositions could be joined to- gether of two persons who pronounced themselves so differently.</p><p>And indeed permit mein your hearing precisely as there, and though the question is settled pre- cisely as though it were still aliveto give you the rea- sons for my opinion, and to put together now at my ease what I then threw out disjointedly amidst many stormy interruptions.</p><p>Let us suppose three judges in all to have been assigned to this cause, and that the decision of one of these had been that the freedmen should die ; of the second, that they should be banished ; of the third, that they should be acquitted.</p><p>Pray, should two of these opinions, by their united strength, destroy the last ?</p><p>Or, taken separately, should not each of them be worth just what the other is, so that the first can no more be connected with the second than the second with the third ?</p><p>It results that, in the Senate as well, votes ought to be reckoned as being opposed to each other, which are given as being different from each other.</p><p>What if one and the same man were to pronounce for death and banishment ? would it be possible for these persons both to die and to be banished in accordance with this single vote ? Indeed, could that be considered one vote at all which conjoined things so diverse ? How, then, when one pronounces for punishing them with death, and another for banishing them, can that appear to be one vote because it is pronounced by two, wliich would not appear one vote if it were pronounced by one ? What ! does not the law clearly teach that the votes for death and those for banishment should be separated, when it orders divisions to be taken in this manner : -" Those who are of this opinion to this side; those who are of any other opinion* to the side wliicli accords witli your opinion."</p><p>Examine tliese words singly and weigh tliem. " Those who are of this opinion," that is to say, who think the men should be banished, " to this side "that is to say, to the side on which the senator who has made the motion for banishment is sitting. From this it is clear that tliose who are in favour of putting them to death cannot remain on the same side. " Those who are of any other opinion." You observe that the law, not content with saying " other," has added to it " any."</p><p>Can there be a doubt, then, that those who put to death hold an entirely different opinion from those who banish ? " To that side which accords with your opinion." Does not the law itself seem to call, to compel, to drive, those who differ to the opposite side ? Does not the Consul, even, point out to every one, and that not merely in the customary form of words, but with his hand and by his gestures, the place where he is to remain or to which he is to pass over ? " But it will happen that if the votes for death and those for banishment be divided, the vote in favour of acquittal may prevail," What does this matter to the persons voting ? It certainly does not become them to strive by every art and every calculation to prevent a more merciful decision from being carried.</p><p>" It is proper, in any case, that those who are for the death penalty and those who are for banishment should first be compared with those who acquit, and afterwards with each other.</p><p>As, for example, at certain of the shows, some individual is separated and reserved by lot to compete with the victor, so in the Senate there are certain first and second trials of strength, and the one of two proposals which comes out victorious is waited on by a third." l^eed I say that if the first proposal be carried the remaining ones are put an end to ? How, then, can propositions be * Qui alia omnia sentitis was really takes it here in the way most suitable a euphemism for " You who are of a for his ai'gument. contrary opinion." Pliuy, however, S joined on a common ground* for which no place can be found subsequently ?</p><p>To repeat this more clearly, when the motion for banishment is made, if those who are for death do not at once go to the other side, it will be in vain that they will differ at a subsequent stage from those with whom they have voted just before. t</p><p>But why do I seem to be teaching when I want to learn whether these motions should have been divided, whether they should have been gone into singly ? To be sure I obtained what I demanded ; none the less, however, do I ask whether I ought to have made the demand. In what way was it obtained ? Why, the senator who had moved that the extreme penalty should be inflicted (overpowered, I do not know whether by the legality, but certainly by the equity of my demand), threw up his own motion, and went over to the side of him who was for banishment : fearing, no doubt, that if the motions were taken separ- atelyand, but for his action, it seemed likely that they would bethe one for acquittal would obtain a majority. And, indeed, there were many more of that one party than in either of the other two taken singly.</p><p>Then those senators, too, who were led by his authority, thus left to themselves after he had gone over, abandoned a proposal which had been forsaken by its own author, and followed in his species of desertion the person whom they followed in his lead.</p><p>So out of three proposals two resulted, and of these two one prevailed, tlie third being extinguished, which, as it could not overcome the two others, had to choose by which of the two it would be defeated. | * Unus atque idem locus.

As for these, whether they be great and wise, I cannot tell ; men they are not. For it is the part of a man to be affected by grief, to feel, yet at the same time to bear up and to admit of consolation, not to be in no need of consolation. However, about all this I have said more perhaps than I ought, yet less than I wished.</p><p>There is, indeed, a certain pleasure even in grief, particularly if you weep into the bosom of a friend who is prepared to bestow on your tears either his approval or his pardon. <ref type="bibr">(17-)</ref> To Macrinus.</p><p>Is the weather as rough and unsettled with you as it is with us ?

He was often heard to say himself, when com- plaining of the miseries forced on him by his infirmities, that he " daily licked the fingers of his slaves." Yet he lived on, and desired to live, kept up principally by his wife, who, by her steadfastness, had turned her fault in entering on such a marriage into a source of glory.</p><p>You have now all the talk of the town, for TuUus con- stitutes all the talk.</p><p>The sale of his effects is looked for.

Whatever be the reason, there are a quantity of things in our city, and the neighbourhood of the city, which we do not even know by hearsay, let alone eyesight.</p><p>Yet if Achaia, Egypt, Asia, had produced these, or any other land fruitful in marvels, and giving them repute too, we should have heard all about, and read all about and explored them. What, at any rate, I had never heard of or seen, I for my part lately heard of and saw at the same time. My wife's grandfather had pressed me to make an in- spection of his estate near Ameria. As I was going over it, a lake lying under us was pointed out to me, named Vadimon ; at the same time some incredible circumstances connected wiih it were related. I reached the lake itself.</p><p>It is rounded into the shape of a horizontal wheel, regular on all sides, without a bay or obliquity of any kind ; ^verytliing is measured to scale and even, as tliougli hollowed and cut out by the hand of an artist. The colour of the water is lighter than dark blue but deeper than bluish green.* It has an odour and a taste of sulphur, and the healing property of mending broken articles.f Its size is small, yet such that it can feel the winds and swell into waves. There is no ship on it (for it is sacred), but floating on it are islands, all of them grassy with reeds and rushes, and other herbage which the swampy soil in its productiveness, or the banks of tlie lake them- selves, bring forth. Each of them has its individual shape and dimensions, but all have their outer edges worn, in consequence of frequently striking either against the shore or against each other, and so rubbing and getting rubbed.</p><p>All of them are of a like elevation and buoyancy, since their roots descend but a little way below the surface, after the fashion of a ship's keel.</p><p>These roots can be seen on every side, suspended and at the same time submerged in the water.</p><p>Occasionally these islands are joined and coupled together, resembling a continent ; occasionally they are dispersed by discordant winds ; not unfrequently, left to themselves, they float in single tranquillity. Often the smaller ones hang on to the lar^rer, like little boats on to ships of burden ; often larger and smaller ones take to a trial, as it were, of each other's speed ; then, again, all of them, driven upon the same part of the shore, form, where they have stopped, a promontory, and, sometimes here, sometimes there, conceal or restore to view portions of the lake.</p><p>It is only when they are in the middle that they do not contract its circumference. It is certain that cattle in pursuit of herbage are in the habit of advancing into these islands, fancying them the edge of the lake, and do not perceive that the soil is moveable till reft from the * Viridi pressior.

For the production in public of these latter, I chose the most fitting time as well as place, andthat they might with- out delay grow accustomed to a hearing from persons with nothing else to do, and at the dinner-tablein the month of July (when, for the most part, there is an interval of rest from the lawsuits), I arranged my friends with seats furnished with desks in front of the dining-couches.</p><p>It so chanced that, on the morning of that day, I was unexpectedly called to assist a friend in court, and this furnished me with a ground for making some prefatory remarks.</p><p>For I entreated that no one would charge me with want of respect for the work in hand, because, when intending to recite (even though only to friends, and to a small audience, which means to friends again), I had not refrained from the courts and from business.

Yes ; but the former is the more straightforward and the more friendly. For he is friendly who thinks the friend- ship felt for him to be such that he is not in dread of being wearisome.

It was at my house that he put on the Latus Claims* I assisted him with my support when he was a candidate for office ; add to this, that he so loved and revered me that he treated me as the moulder of his characteras his master, so to speak. A rare thing this in the case of our young men. For how few of them will yield, as being inferior, either to the age or the authority of another ? They are all at once wise ; they all at once know everything ; they revere no one ; they imitate no one, and are indeed themselves their own models. Not so Avitus, whose chief wisdom was in esteeming others wiser than himself, whose chief erudition was in his desire to learn.</p><p>He was always seeking some advice, either on the subject of his studies or the duties of life, and he always went away with a sense of being made better. And so he was, either from what he had heard, or at any rate from having inquired. What deference he paid to that most accomplished man Servianus, when the latter was Legate and he was military tribune. He so appreciated and at the same time captivated Servianus that in his march across from Germania to Pannonia he followed him, not as being one of his army, but as a companion and personal attendant.</p><p>Such was his industry, such his unassuming character, than in his capacity of Quaestor he was no less pleasant and agreeable than useful to his Consuls, of whom he served several. How active, how indefatigable he was in his pursuit of this very office of ^dile, from the enjoyment of which he has been prematurely snatched away ! And this it is which greatly aggravates my grief. There present themselves to my eyes his vain labours and fruitless applications, and the honour which he succeeded in deserving only. There returns to my mind that Latus Clavus assumed in my house ; those first, those last efforts of mine on his behalf; the discourses, the consultations which we held together.

For, although you have read them and given them to read to many, yet I would not have any person whatever suppose that you have begun only after his decease what in fact you had completed in his life-time. Let your reputation for intrepidity be intact. And so it will be, if it be known to friends and foes that it was not merely after your enemy's death that the courage to write was born in you, but that you were quite ready for publication and were only forestalled by his death. At the same time you will avoid the reproach " Unjust are all the insults o'er the dead." * For that which has been written and read aloud on the subject of a living person, if published, even after his decease, is published, as it were, against a person still living, provided this be done at once. Consequently, if you have anything else in hand, lay it aside for the time. Put the finishing touch to this work, which to me, who have read it formerly, seems long since complete ; however, let it now seem so to you too, since not only does the matter * Homer, Odyssey xxii. 412.

You are very obliging in pressing me not only for fre- quent letters, but for very long ones into the bargain. I have been somewhat chary in this matter, partly from a regard for your avocations, partly from my having been myself much engrossed by matters, in general of small interest, which, however, at the same time distract and weary the attention.</p><p>Besides, I had no materials for writing more.</p><p>Nor, indeed, is my situation the same as that of M. Tullius, whose example you invite me to f oUow.</p><p>For not merely was he gifted with a most prolific genius, but events in great variety and of great importance supplied that genius with abundant material.</p><p>How narrow are the limits in which / am enclosed, you well know, without my telling you, unless haply I should wish to send you letters of the school-exercise kind, and from the shade of the closet, if I may so express it. But nothing, to my mind, could be less apposite, when I think of your arms, your camps, in fine, your horns and trumpets and sweat and dust and burning suns.</p><p>You are now furnished, as I think, with a reasonable excuse, and yet I am not sure that I should wish it to be approved by you. For it is a sign of the highest affection to refuse to make allowance for the shortness of one's friends' letters, even although one may know that it can be satisfactorily accounted for.</p><p>(3-)</p><p>To Paulinus.</p><p>Different men have different ideas on the subject, but I for my part deem that individual the most fortunate who enjoys to the full the foretaste of a noble and enduring fame,, and, assured of posthumous reputation,* lives in the company of his future glory. And, for me indeed, if the prize of immortality were not before my eyes, the usual snug and sound repose would be my choice. For I suppose it is the duty of all men to think of themselves as either immortal or mortal; in the former case, certainly, to contend and to exert themselves ; in the latter, to keep quiet, to repose themselves, and not to fatigue their short existence by fleeting efforts ; as I see many do, who, by a wretched and at the same time thankless appearance of activity, only attain in the end to a contempt for themselves. All this, which I say daily to myself, I now say to you, that I may leave off saying it to myself, if you dissent ; though to be sure you, in your character of one who is always meditating some great and immortal work, will not dissent.</p><p>(4.)</p><p>To Mackinus.</p><p>I should be afraid you would think the oration, which you will receive with this letter, of immoderate length, if it were not of such a kind as to seem to have many be- ginnings and many endings.

So, at whatever point you begin, or at whatever place you leave</p><p>off, you will be able to read what next follows both in the light of a new commencement and a connected sequel, and so to pronounce me, if extremely long as to the whole, yet extremely short as to the separate parts. * Certus posterifatis, "With his this sense of " determined on ; " but purpose set on posthumous fame."the rendering in the text is^simpler, Prichard and Bernard's "Selected and, I think, better.

For many, while they are apprehensive of seeming to give in too much to the interest of the powerful, obtain a reputation for ill-breed- ing, and even for ill-nature. Of this fault you have kept yourself well clear; I know it. Nevertheless I cannot refrain from bestowing praise on you, under the guise of advice, for maintaining a due mean, so as to preserve the distinctions of ranks and dignities; for, if these are confounded, disordered, and intermingled, nothing can be more unequal than this very equality.</p><p>(6.)</p><p>To Calvisius.</p><p>I have been passing all this time between my writing- tablets and my books in the most delicious calm. " How- ever," you ask, " have you been able to do this in town ?</p><p>"</p><p>The Circensian games were on,a species of exhibition which does not attract me even in the faintest degree.</p><p>There is no novelty, no variety about them, nothing which one is not satisfied with having seen once only.</p><p>This makes me all the more astonished that so many thousands of persons should have such a childish desire to see, over and over again, horses running, and men standing in chariots.</p><p>If, at least, they were attracted by the speed of the horses or the skill of the men, there would be some reason in the thing. As it is, it is a bit of cloth that they applaud, a bit of cloth that they love, and if during the race itself and in the very heat of the contest such and such colours were to change wearers, the favour and applause of the public would change over with them, and the very drivers, the very horses whom they know from afar and whose names they shout out, would all at once be deserted. Such is the influence, such the importance, of a con- temptible jacket ! I say nothing of the vulgar, itself more contemptible than the jacket; but such is the case with certain persons of standing. When I remember that these can settle down so insatiably to what is so inane, insipid, and tedious, I take some pleasure in the fact that I am not taken by this pleasure.* So, I employ in litera- ture my idle hours, throughout these days which others waste in the idlest of occupations.</p><p>( <ref type="formula">70</ref>To EOilANUS.</p><p>You write that you are engaged in building. 'Tis well.</p><p>I have found my defence; for I build with reason the moment that I do so in your company. Indeed there is this further resemblance between us, that you are building by the sea-side, and I by the Larian Lake. There are several villas of mine on the shore of this lake, but two of them, while they greatly delight me, exercise me in an equal degree. One of them, placed on the rocks, after the fashion of Baise, overlooks the lake ; another, similarly after the fashion of Baiae, is at the edge of the lake.</p><p>Hence I am in the habit of calling the former "</p><p>Tragedy,"</p><p>and the latter " Comedy," because one is supported as it were by a high buskin, and the other by a low sock.-f-Each of them has its special charm, which their very diversity renders more agreeable to the possessor of both.</p><p>One enjoys a nearer, the other a more extended view of the lake ; one, with a gentle curve, embraces a small bay, the other, situated on a lofty crag, separates two small bays from each other ; there a promenade stretches for a long way, in a straight line, along the shore, here it gently curves in the sha,pe of a spacious terrace-walk ; one of them does not feel the waves, and the other breaks them. From the former you can look down on the people fishing, from the latter you can fish yourself, and throw your line * from your room, and actually from your sofa almost, just as from a skiff. These are my reasons for adding to each what is wanting, in view of the superabundant advantages already enjoyed by both. But why enter into reasons with you ? It will stand for a good reason with you that you are doing the same thing.</p><p>(8.)</p><p>To AUGUPJNUS.</p><p>If, after you have praised me, I shall begin to praise you, I am apprehensive of seeming to be repaying a favour rather than profiering a judgment. Yet, though it should seem so, I esteem all your writings to be admirable ; chiefly, however, those which are about me. This happens owing to one and the same cause ; for not only do you write exceedingly well on the subject of your friends, but I too, as I read, find what is written on the subject of myself exceedingly good.</p><p>(9.) To Colon us.</p><p>I particularly applaud you for being so grievously affected by the death of Pomponius Quintianus, that you prolong your regard for the lost one by means of your regrets ; not like so many who care only for the living, or * Literally, " your hook."</p><p>rather pretend to care for them, and indeed do not even pretend, except in the case of those whom they see to be prosperous.</p><p>For they forget the unfortunate, no less than if they were dead. But your faithfulness is unfailing, and your constancy in love such that it can be ended only by your death. And, by Hercules, Quintianus was a man who ought to be cherished on the strength of his own example.</p><p>He loved the successful,* defended the wretched, mourned for the lost. What nobility in his mien to start with ! What deliberation in his speech ! How evenly balanced his severity and his playfulness ! What his love for letters !</p><p>What his judgment ! How dutifully did he live with a father most unlike himself ! How the fact of his being the best of sons was no hindrance to his seeming the best of men ! f But why do I aggravate your grief ? Yet you so loved the young man that you would rather have this, than that silence should be kept about him, particularly by me, by whose commendation you think that his life may be illustrated, his memory prolonged, and that very youth, from which he has been snatched, restored to him.

Do you not sometimes do that which your son, if he were suddenly turned into your father and you into his son, might reprehend with the like severity ? Are not all men led by some error or other ? Does not one man indulge himself in one respect, and another in another ? "</p><p>Admonished by this example of excessive severity, I have, in accordance with our mutual affection, thus written to you, lest you too should at any time treat your son too sharply and rudely.</p><p>Reflect, not only that he is a boy, but that you have been one, and so use this your position of father as to remember that you are both a man and the father of a man.</p><p>(I3-)</p><p>To QUADRATUS.</p><p>In proportion to the interest and attention with which you have read the books composed by me, on the subject of the vindication of Helvidius, is the eagerness of your demand that I should write to you in detail on such matters as are not contained in the books, and on such as bear reference to them, in short, as to the whole process of an affair which you were too young to be personally interested in.</p><p>After Domitian had been put to death, I deliberated within myself, and resolved that here was a great and noble opportunity for pursuing the guilty, vindicating the unfortunate, and bringing one's self into notice. Further, BOOK IX. 299 among the numerous crimes of numerous people, none seemed more atrocious than that, in the Senate, a Senator should have laid hands on a Senator, a man of praetorian on a man of consular rank, a judge on an accused person.</p><p>Independently of this, there was a friendship between myself and Helvidius as intimate as there could be with one who, through dread of the times, hid in seclusion his great name, and the great qualities which matched it. I was a friend, too, of Arria and Fannia, one of whom was Helvidius's stepmother, and the other that step- mother's parent.</p><p>But I was not so much incited by private obligations as by public justice, by the disgraceful character of the deed, by a consideration of the example to be made.</p><p>Accordingly, during the first few days of restored liberty, every one on his own account had been at once impeaching and crushing his own private enemies (at least the smaller ones) with a confused and turbulent clamour.</p><p>I, for my part, deemed it a more temperate and also a more courageous course to attack a monstrous criminal, not by means of the popular resentment of the day, but by means of his own individual crime. So, as soon as that first impulse had sufficiently cooled down, and fury growing daily feebler had come back to a sense of justicethough I was at that time particularly sad, having lately lost my wife -I sent to Anteia, the widow of Helvidius, and asked her to come to me, since my still recent bereavement kept me within doors. On her arrival, " It has been decided," said I, " by me, not to suffer your husband to remain unavenged. Announce this to Arria and Fannia " (they had returned from exile). " Consult yourself, consult them, as to whether you wish to parti- cipate in an action in which I need no associate ; yet I am not so solicitous about my own glory as to grudge you a share in it." Anteia conveyed the message, and the ladies did not hesitate. The Senate, very opportunely, was to meet within three days.</p><p>' I always referred everything to Corellius, knowing liim for the most far-seeing and wisest man of our time. On this occasion, however, I was content with my own counsel, fearing that he would put his veto on it, for he was inclined to hesitation and caution. But I could not prevail on myself to refrain from intimating to him, the same day, what I was about to do in a matter about which I was not deliberating, having learnt by experience that, where you have made up your mind, it is best not to seek advice from those whose advice you would be bound to obey. I attended the Senate, begged leave to speak, and spoke for a short time with the greatest approval.</p><p>When I began to touch on the charge, and to hint at a person to be charged (yet still without naming him), there came reclamations from all sides. Said one, " Let us know who it is that you are accusing out of order ! " Another, " Who can be charged before being put in accusation by the Senate ? " A third, " Spare us who survive ! " I heard them without perturbance or dismay ; such strength Kes in the goodness of one's cause ; and so great a difference does it make in the way of giving you confidence or frightening you, whether people do not like what you are doing, or do not approve of it. It would be tedious to recount everything that was thrown out from one quarter and another. Last of all the Consul said, " Secundus, when you are called on for your vote, you will be able to speak if you choose." I replied, " You will have accorded me a permission, which up to this time you have accorded to every one." I resumed my seat, and other business was transacted.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of my friends of consular rank deeming me to have advanced myself with too much daring and rashness, reproved me in some private and anxious words, recalling me, and warning me to stop. He went so far as to add, " You have made yourself a marked man in the eyes of future Princes." " So be it," said</p><p>I, " provided BOOK IX. 301 they are bad Princes." Scarce had he departed, when again another, " What daring is this ? Whither are you rushing ?</p><p>What dangers are you throwing yourself in the way of ? Why trust to the present state of things, while uncertain as to the future ? You are attacking a man who is already Praefect of the Treasury, and who will shortly be Consul; a man, besides, supported by such interest and such connections ! " He named a certain person, who at that time commanded a powerful and renowned army in the Eastnot without strong and suspicious rumours being connected with him. To this I answered, "All Pve foreseen, and each event have weighed ? * Nor will I refuse, if fortune shall so bring it to pass, to suffer for a deed of the highest honour, provided I avenge one of the deepest guilt."</p><p>It was now time for pronouncing our opinions. Domi- tius Apollinaris, Consul-Elect, spoke ; there spoke also Eabricius Veiento, Eabius Postumius, and Vettius Proculus, the colleague of Publicius Certus (the person under discussion), who was moreover the stepfather of the wife whom I had lost. After these came Ammius Flaccus. They all of them defended Certusthough he had not yet been named by mejust as though he had been named, and by their defence took up a charge which I had left, so to speak, unattached. What further they said it is not necessary to relate. You have it in the books, for I have gone through the whole, using their own words. Avidius Quietus and Cornutus Tertullus spoke on the other side.</p><p>Quietus said, " It would be most unjust that the complaints of aggrieved parties should be ex- cluded ; that, consequently, the right of presenting their plaints should not be taken from Arria and Fannia nor would he now endure to desert the duties of his office ; in the discharge of wliich, however, he would set bounds to his own grief, and would merely convey the extremely temperate sentiments of these admirable ladies. They were content to call the attention of the Senate to the bloodthirsty sycophancy of Publicius Certus, and to beg that, in case punishment for guilt of the clearest kind were remitted, he might at any rate be branded by some mark, like that inflicted by the Censor." Upon this, Satrius</p><p>Eufus made a kind of half-and-half ambiguous speech.</p><p>" I think," said he,</p><p>" that injury has been inflicted on Publicius Certus, if he is not acquitted. He has been named by the friends of Arria and Fannia, and he has been named by his own friends. Nor ought we to feel a difficulty about this ; for we, the same who now pronounce favourably on the man, will also have to judge him.* If he is innocent, as I hope and wish, and, until something be proved against him, believe, you will be able to acquit him."</p><p>So they spoke, in the order in which each was called upon. Then came my turn. I rose and preluded, as in the book, replying to each severally. It was astonishing with what attention, what plaudits, everything that fell from me was received by the very persons who had just before been crying out upon me. Such was the change which ensued, either from the great importance of the affair, or the success of the oration, or the intrepidity of the speaker. I came to an end. Veiento commenced replying, but no one would endure him. There was a great noise and disturbance, so great indeed as to make him say, " I entreat, Conscript Fathers, that you will not compel me to invoke the aid of the Tribune." Upon which, Murena, the Tribune, immediately exclaimed, " I give you leave to speak, most noble Veiento." Even then he was * The meaning seems to be, "Do whitewash him. He -will still be sub- net be apprehensive that our present ject to be tried by us, in regular form, decision in his favour will entirely if evidence is adduced against him. " shouted at. Meanwhile, the Consul called over the names, got through the diArision, and dismissed the Senate, leaving Veiento still almost on his legs and trying to speak. He complained loudly of this insult (so he called it), citing Homer's line -" Old man, by younger warriors tliou'rt oppressed." * There "was scarce any one in the Senate who did not embrace and salute me, and vie in loading me with praises for having reintroduced the practice, so long interrupted, of consulting the public welfare, at the risk of incurring personal animosities ; for having, in short, freed the Senate from the odium which was kindled against it among other orders, as being severe against the rest, and, with a kind of reciprocal connivance, indulgent to Senators alone. All this took place in the absence of Certus ; for he was absent, either because he suspected something of the kind, or (as the excuse was made for him) because he was ill.</p><p>Caesar, indeed, did not refer to the Senate any communication with regard to him ; nevertheless I obtained what I had aimed at. For the colleague of Certus got the Con- sulship, and Certus himself was superseded, and what I had said at the end of my speech was completely carried out :</p><p>" Let him give up, under the best, the distinction which he obtained under the worst of Princes."</p><p>Subsequently I put together again my speech, as best I could, and made many additions. It happened by chance (but so as not to appear like chance) that Certus died a victim to disease within a very few days after the publication of my book. I heard people relate how this was the image which flitted before his mind and his eyehe seemed to see me threatening him with a sword. Whether this was true or not I would not venture to say positively ; yet it would be to the interest of example that it should be held to be true.</p><p>Here you have a letter which, if you consider the limits of a letter, is no shorter than the book you have read.</p><p>But you must lay this to your own account, for not having been contented with the book.</p><p>(14.)</p><p>To Tacitus.   You are not the man for self-applause ; yet there is nothing which I write with more sincerity than what I write about you.

I, who enjoyed his intimate affection and approval, can personally testify that only on a single occasion in my hearing did he go so far as to relate just this one anecdote on the subject of his own actions, namely, that Cluvius had once addressed him in these terms : " You know, Verginius, the truthful- ness which is due to history ; accordingly, if you should read anything in my histories different from what you would wish, pray forgive me." To which he replied, "Are you ignorant, Cluvius, that I did what I did precisely that it might be free to you authors to write what you chose ? " Come, now, let us compare this very Frontinus in the very respect in which he seems to you more modest and restrained.</p><p>He forbad a monument to be constructed; but in what words ? " The expense of a monument is superfl.uous. My memory will endure if my life deserved it." Do you think it more modest to give out, to be read over the whole world, that one's memory will endure, than in one single spot to inscribe what you have done, in a couple of verses ? Though, to be sure, it is not my object to find fault with Frontinus, but to defend Vermnius : and what can be a juster defence of him, as far as you are con- cerned, than that which arises from a comparison with him of the person you have preferred ? In my judgment, indeed, neither of them is to be blamed, since both strove 3o8 PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>after glory with equal longing, though by a different roadone by desiring the inscription which was his due, the other by choosing rather the appearance of despising it.</p><p>(20.)</p><p>To Venator.</p><p>Your letter, assuredly, was all the more agreeable to me in proportion to its length, particularly as the whole of it was on the subject of my small productions ; and I do not wonder at these being a pleasure to you, since you love everything connected with me just as you love me in person.</p><p>I am, at the present moment, gathering in my vintage, a slender one, to be sure, yet a more plentiful one than I had anticipatedif "gathering in" it can be called to pluck a grape now and then, to visit the press, to taste the new wine out of the vat, to drop in on my servants from town, who are now overlooking the country ones, and who have left me to the company of my secre- taries and readers. <ref type="bibr">(21.)</ref> To Sabinianus.</p><p>Your freedman, whom you told me you were so angry with, came to me and prostrated himself, and clung to my feet as though they had been your own. There were many tears, many prayers, and even much silence on his part ; in short, he convinced me of his penitence. I believe him to be truly amended, because he feels that he has sinned.</p><p>You are angry, I know, and you are rightly angry, that I know too ; but it is precisely when there is the most just ground for anger that clemency is entitled to the highest praise.</p><p>You have loved the man, and I hope you will love him again ; meanwhile it will suffice that you permit yourself to be entreated. It will be lawful for you to be angry with him anew if lie shall have deserved it ; and if you are entreated now, you will do this with a better excuse. Make some allowance in view of the man's youth, in view of his tears, in view of your owm goodness of heart. Do not torment him, and do not torment yourself into the bargain. For you are tormented, you, who are so gentle, when you are angry. I fear that I shall seem not so much to entreat as to compel, should my prayers be joined to his. I will, however, join them, and they are all the stronger and the more profuse in proportion to the sharpness and severity with which I reprimanded him, having strictly threatened him that I would never again make an appli- cation to you. So much to him, for it was proper that he should be frightened ; I do not say the same to you. Eor possibly I may again apply to you, and again obtain my object.</p><p>May it only be such as it will become me to ask for and you to vouchsafe !

He is a man of the highest worth and honour, and one who is greatly attached to me ; moreover, in literature he rivals, recalls, and reproduces the ancients, particularly Propertius, from whom he is descended, whose genuine offspring he is, and whom he most resembles in the points in which the former excelled. If you take his elegiacs in hand, you will read a polished, dainty, charming book, an evident production of the household of Propertius. Eecently he has turned to lyrics, in which he presents us with Horace, just as in the former kind of poetry with Propertius.</p><p>You would suppose, if relationship has any power in letters, that he must be Horace's kinsman as well. He is 3IO PLINY'S LETTERS.</p><p>full of variety and flexibility. His love passages are those of a genuine lover ; he mourns like one who will not be consoled ; his praise is of the most benign, and his play- fulness of the most humorous character ; in short, he bestows the same pains on the tout ensemble as on the several parts.</p><p>Sick in mind (no less than he was sick in body) on account of such a friend and such a genius, I have at length recovered him and have myself recovered* Congratulate me, congratulate literature itself too, which has encoiintered as great a risk from his peril as it will obtain glory in consequence of his safety, <ref type="bibr">(23-)</ref> To Maximus.</p><p>Often has it happened to me, when pleading, that the Centumviri, after keeping for a long while to their judicial dignity and gravity, have suddenlyas though vanquished and compelled to the actrisen from their seats in a body and applauded me.</p><p>Often have I obtained from the Senate the highest glory I had aspired to.

" He replied, " You know me, and from your reading too." Upon which the other inquired, " Are you Tacitus or Pliny ?

To acknowledge the truth, I enjoy a great reward from my labours. Why, if Demosthenes was rightly delighted because an old woman of Athens recognised him in these terms, " This is Demosthenes ! " ought not / to rejoice in the celebrity of my name ? And truly I do rejoice, and own that I rejoice. Nor indeed do I fear to seem too much puffed up, since it is the opinion of others about me, and not my own, that I am putting forward ; and especially since this is to you, who not only do not grudge the praises bestowed on any man, but also favour those bestowed on me.</p><p>(24-) To Sabinianus.</p><p>You have done well in taking back to your home and your heart the freedman formerly so dear to you, with my letter for his passport.* This will be a satisfaction to you.</p><p>It is certainly a satisfaction to me : first, because I see you to be so tractable that even in your anger you are capable of being ruled; in the next place, because you make so much account of me as either to yield to my authority or to comply with my prayers. So I praise as well as thank you. At the same time, I admonish you, as to the future, to show yourself placable in regard to the errors of those about you, even though there should be no one by to intercede in their behalf. yet, as though you were in entire enjoyment of the most complete repose, you read my sportive effusions and trifles, you delight in them, call for them, and strongly urge me to the composition of others like them.

To LUPERCUS.</p><p>I once saidaptly, as I thinkof a certain orator of our epoch, who, though correct and sensible, was lacking in grandeur and ornamentation, " His only sin is that he does not sin," Indeed, an orator ought to be excited and elevated, at times even to boil over and be hurried along, and so, often to approach a precipice ; for what is high and lofty generally has a chasm adjoining it. The road over a plain is safer, but at the same time humbler and lower ; runners meet with more falls than crawlers, but the latter get no credit for not falling, while the former get some, even though they do fall. For, as in the case of certain accomplishments, so in that of eloquencenothing commends it so much as its hazards. You see what ap- plause dancers on a lofty tight-rope generally elicit when they seem on the point of falling; for we most admire what is most unexpected and dangerous, and, as the Greeks more strongly express it, most "dare-devilish."</p><p>Hence the worth of a helmsman is by no means the same BOOK IX.</p><p>J' J when sailing on a qniet as when on a stormy sea. In the former case he enters the harbour without being admired by any onewithout praise, without glory. But when the cordaQ-e creaks, and the mast bends, and the rudder</p><p>groans, then what a great man he is, and how near to a sea-god ! Why all this ? Because you seem to me to have noted certain passages in my writings as being turgid which I thought elevated, as audacious which I thought bold, as extravagant which I thought full. Now, it makes a great difference whether what you note be reprehensible or merely conspicuous. For every one has his attention attracted by what is prominent and stands out in relief ; only, diligent attention is necessary for judging between what is sublime and what exceeds the bounds, what is</p><p>lofty and what is extravagant. And, to quote Homer for choice, pray who can forget, whichever way they be judged, the words -" All around</p><p>The mighty heaven gave out a trumpet sound ; " and " His spear upon a cloud reclined ; " and all that passage, " Nor such the shout of Ocean's wave."</p><p>But you want a tongued-balance and scales to ascertain whether these expressions are impossible and unmeaning, or on the other hand glorious and divine. Not that I am now supposing myself to have ever uttered or to be capable of uttering anything like this. I am not such a madman.</p><p>But I only wish this to be understood, that the reins of eloquence should be left loose, and the flights of genius should not be restrained in the narrowest of circles. But it will be said that the conditions of oratory are one thing and those of poetry another. Just as if M. TuUius were less daring ! However, I pass him by, for indeed I do not think the subject admits of doubt. But Demosthenes himself, that pattern and model orator, pray does he contain or restrain himself when he utters those well- known words, " Base, fawning, accursed wretches of men ! " or again, " It is not with stones or bricks that I have fortified the city ; " and directly afterwards, " Ought not Eubcea to have been made to flank Attica on the sea-board ? " and elsewhere, "For my part, Athenians, by the Gods, I think that the man is drunk with the magnitude of his own ex- ploits."</p><p>What indeed can be more daring than that most exquisite and lengthy digression beginning with " 'Tis a terrible malady " ? How about this, shorter than the preceding, but equal in boldness, " Then I (yielded not)</p><p>to Python in his insolence and flowing with his full tide against you" ? Of the same stamp is this, " When a man is powerful through rapacity and wickedness, like this one, the first occasion, the smallest stumble, will altogether unseat and destroy him." A similar expression is " Eoped off from all civic rights,"* and in the same place, "You, Aristogeiton, have surrendered all the pity that might have been felt for such deeds as these, or rather you have entirely extinguished it. Do not, therefore, come for anchorage to harbours which you have yourself blocked up and filled with piles." He had previously said, " For I fear lest some may think that you are engaged in training such of the citizens as are desirous of turning out scoundrels." And afterwards, " I see that none of these topics can offer a passage for this man, nothing but precipices and chasms and yawning pits."-f-It is not enough to say, "For I do not understand that our ancestors built these courts for you in order that you might plant in them such fellows as these ; " he adds, " If he is a dealer and a retailer and a huckster in villainy," and a thousand things of the same kind, to pass over what ^schines called "monstrosities," not "expressions."</p><p>* Demostli. c.

For in other points his power, in these his sublimity shines forth. And pray did ^schines himself abstain from what he reproved in Demosthenes?

Pray is this more guarded or temperate, " You are irritating the wound, . . . seizing him as a political pirate sailing throuo;h the state," and the rest of it ?

Observing this, I try my hand at various kinds of literature, not being sufficiently con- fident about any of them. So when you read this or that of mine, allow for each single composition a^n ot stand- ing by itself. Pray, in the case of the other arts, is the number of productions an excuse for shortcomings ; and is there to be a harder law in the case of literature, in which the execution is so much more difficult ? Yet why do I talk of allowance, like an ingrate ?

Now, the jirincipal thing is to be content with one's own ; after that, to support, to cherish, and, as it were, to encompass in a circle of fellowship those whom one knows to be particularly in need. If your friend does all these things, he is thoroughly to be commended ; if any one of them, to a smaller degree indeed, yet still to be commended, so rare is the type of even imperfect generosity.</p><p>Such a passion for getting has seized on men that they seem to be taken possession of rather than to be possessors. <ref type="bibr">(31.)</ref> To Sardus.</p><p>Since leaving you, I have been no less in your company than when with you.

Shall I commend you, and thank you at the same time ? I can do neither sufficiently, and, even if I could, should fear it might be presumptuous to commend you on account of what I had to thank you for.

The inhabitants of every age are strongly addicted to fishing, boating, and likewise swimming;</p><p>particularly the boys, who are attracted by idleness and sport.</p><p>In their eyes, it is glory and renown to swim out a long way ; the victor is he who has left the shore, as well as his fellows, the furthest distance behind him. In this kind of contest, a certain lad, bolder than the rest, was getting far out to sea. Suddenly a dolphin met him, and at one time went in front of, at another followed, and then swam round him, at last took him on his back, then put him off, then took him on again, next bore the trem- bling lad seaward, and presently turning back to the shore, restored him to terra firma and his companions. The report of this crept through the town; all the inhabitants flocked up and contemplated the lad himself as a kind of prodigy, they questioned him, and listened to him, and repeated his story. Next day they took posses- sion of the shore, and gazed upon the sea and everything that looked like sea.* The boys swam, and among them the one in question, but with greater caution. Again to time came the dolphin, and again he made for the boy, who fled with his companions. The dolphin, as though inviting and recalling him, leapt out of the water, and dived and twined and untwined himself in a variety of circles.</p><p>The same thing happened the next day, and a third day, and on several days, till these men, brought up to the sea, began to be ashamed of their fears.

Other boys too, on the right and left, swim with their friend, cheering and exhorting him.</p><p>What is also marvellous, another dolphin accompanied this one, but only in the character of a spectator and attendant, for he neither performed nor submitted to any- thing of the same kind; he merely led the other and escorted him back, just as the rest of the boys did with this boy.</p><p>Though it seems incredible (yet it is just as true as what has preceded), this dolphin, that carried and played with boys, would often leave his element for the land, and after drying himself in the sands, would, as soon as he had grown warm, roll back into the sea. It is ascertained that Octavius Avitus the Pro-consular Legate, led by a vicious superstition, poured ointment on him after he had been attracted to the shore, and that the strangeness of the thing and the smell caused him to escape back into the deep, and that he was not seen for many days afterwards, and then languid and dull ; yet soon afterwards he regained his spirits, and resumed his former friskiness and his accustomed offices.

Yet there is a certain limit to this ; in the first place, because too much care serves to impair rather than to emend ; next, because it calls us off from newer attempts, and, while it does not</p><p>\ BOOK IX. 323 make perfect what went before, prevents us from com- mencing what ought to come after. (36.) To Fuscus.</p><p>You ask how I dispose of my day in summer-time at my place iu Tuscany. I wake when I choose, generally about six o'clock, often before that, rarely later. My windows remain closed ; for, thus marvellously with- drawn from all distractions, by means of the silence and the darkness, I am my own master and am left to myself; I make my eyes wait on my mind, not my mind on the eyes ; and the eyes will see the same things as the mind, when they have nothing else to see.</p><p>I ponder whatever I have in hand, ponder it just as if writing it out word for word and correcting it, at one time a shorter, at another a longer portion, according as it has been difficult or easy to compose or to recollect. I call for my amanuensis, and, letting in the daylight, dictate what I have put together ; he goes away, is recalled, is dismissed afresh. At ten or eleven o'clock (for the time is not fixed or subject to regulation), according to the weather, I betake myself to the terrace-walk or else to the cloisters, where I meditate and dictate the sequel ; then I get into my carriage. There, too, I employ myself in the same way as when walking or lying on my couch ; my attention remains constant, being refreshed by the change itself.</p><p>Next, I go to sleep again for a short time, then walk, and presently read a Greek or Latin oration aloud and with emphasis, not so much for the sake of my voice as my digestion, yet my voice is also strengthened at the same time. Again I walk, am anointed, exercise myself and bathe. At dinner, if taken in company with my wife or a small party, a book is read out. After dinner comes the comedian or a performer on the lyre ; shortly after- wards, I take a stroll with my attendants, in the mimher of whom are some persons of cultivation. In this way the evening is occupied by varied conversation, and the day, however long, is soon brought to an end.</p><p>At times some changes are made in the above disposi- tion.</p><p>Tor if I have been a long while on my couch, or walk- ing, it is only after a nap and a reading that I take the air, not in a carriage, butwhich takes less time, as being more rapidon horseback. Friends drop in with their visits from the neighbouring villages, engrossing to themselves part of my day ; and now and then, when I am wearied with study, these seasonable interruptions are of service to me. Occasionally I hunt, but not without my note-books, so that, if I fail in tahing something, I may at any rate have some- to bring Iwme.

This plan, it is true, requires great honesty, sharp eyes, and numerous hands.

For which reason, when the Provincials chose me as their patron against Marius Prisons, I begged to be excused this office, and obtained my wish. But when subsequently the Consul- Elect gave it as his opinion that we, whose excuse had been accepted, should be urged to place ourselves at the disposal of the Senate, and to suffer our names to be thrown with others into the urn,* I deemed it most in accord with the even tenor of your reign not to resist the desire, especially such a moderate one, of the most honour- able House.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="31">(40}.</head><p>To Tkajan.</p><p>Saving your majesty, sir, it behoves you to conde- scend to my difficulties, seeing that you have given me the right to refer to you in all matters of doubt. In many cities, and particularly Nicomedia and Nicsea, certain per- sons who had been condemned to the mines, or the arena, and similar kinds of punishment, exercise the office and ministry of public slaves, and even, in the capacity of * " Sent to the colours," as we say. public slaves, receive annual wages.</p><p>On hearing this, I hesitated much and long as to what I ought to do. For, on the one hand, to remit to their punishment, after a great lapse of time, men, most of whom are now in years and who are alleged to be leading honest and discreet lives, seemed to me to be too severe : on the other hand, to retain convicts in public employments appeared to me not quite respectable.</p><p>Again, I judged that for these people to be supported by the commonwealth in idleness would be useless; and that if they were not supported, there would be actual danger. Perforce, therefore, I have left the whole matter in suspense, till I had consulted you. You will perhaps inquire how it came to pass that they were exempted from the punishments to which they had been condemned, and so did I inquire, but could get no positive information to lay before you. For though the decrees, by which they had been condemned, were produced, no documents were forthcoming to prove their having been let off. There were, however, some who said that they had obtained their dismissal by their prayers at the bidding of the Proconsuls or Legates. What imparts credit to this is, that it must be supposed no one would venture on such an act without authority.</p></div>

Now this will be a matter specially requiring correction, that those who have been condemned to punishments should not only have been released from them, as you write, without authority, but should even be removed into the cate- gory of respectable servants. Those, then, who have been condemned within the last ten years and have not been liberated by any competent authority, it will be proper to remit to their punishment : if there shall be found some older and aged persons who have been condemned more than ten years ago^w e must distribute them in such ofQces as are not far from being penal. For persons of this kind are usually assigned to the baths, the cleansing of the latrines, also to working on the roads and in the streets.</p></div>

It spread the wider first through violence of the wind and next through the apathy of the inhabi- tants, who, it is quite clear, remained idle and motionless spectators of the sad calamity : and, independently of this, there was nowhere any fire-engine f for public use, no water-bucket, in short, no implement for keeping down conflagrations.</p><p>As for these, indeed, in accordance with my orders already given, they will be provided. Do you, sir, consider whether you think a guild of firemen should be instituted, limited to one hundred and fifty men. I will see to it that no one shall be admitted except he be a fireman, and that they shall not use the rights accorded them for any other purpose.

I have in person found my way to a spring of great purity, from which it seems that the water ought to be conducted to the spot (as was origi- nally attempted) by means of arches, so that it may not reach only to the flat and low-lying parts of the city. A very few arches still remain, and some may further be erected of the squared stones taken from the former con- struction ; some portions, as it seems to me, will have to be made of brickwork, which is both handier and cheaper.</p><p>But, first of all, it is necessary that a conduit-master or architect should be sent, that what has taken place before may not happen again. All I can say is, that the utility and beauty of the construction will be in all respects worthy of your reign, 38</p><p>Tkajan to Pliny.</p><p>Care must be taken that water be conducted to the city of Nicomedia. I have full confidence that you will ad- dress yourself to this work with all due diligence.

For it is subsiding and gaping with huge fissures, either by reason of the soil being wet and spongy, or because the stone itself is poor and friable. It cer- tainly deserves consideration whether it ought to be completed, or abandoned, or even demolished, for the props and substructions, by which it is from time to time kept up, seem to me to be sources of expenditure rather than of strength.</p><p>Many additions are promised to this theatre by private individuals, as, for instance, galleries all round, and porticoes over the spectators' seats, all of which are now delayed, owing to the stoppage of the work which must first be completed.</p><p>These same people of ISTicsea have begun to rebuild the gymnasium, which was destroyed by fire before my arrival, with many more parts and on a larger scale than before, and they have already gone to some expense ; as the dan- ger is, to small advantage, for it is ill-arranged and scat- tered.</p><p>Moreover, an architect, a rival to be sure of the one by whom the work was commenced, afiirms that the walls, though two and twenty feet in thickness, are unable to support the weight imposed on them, in consequence of their being stuffed with cement in the middle and not encased in brickwork.</p><p>The people of Claudiopolis, too, are excavating, rather than building, huge baths in a low situation, with a hill actually hanging over it ; and this, too, out of the moneys which the new members of their Council, added by your favour, have either already paid as their entrance-fees, or are paying in at our demand. Since, then, I fear that, in the one case, the public money, and, in the other, what is of more value than any money, the produce of your favour, may be badly invested, I am compelled to ask you, not only on account of the theatre, but also of these baths, to send an architect.

This work demands many hands, but these, to be sure, are not wanting, for there is a large supply of men in the country parts, and a still larger in the city, and we may confidently expect that all of them will with much alacrity engage in a work which will be of advantage to all.</p><p>It remains for you, if you shall see fit, to send us a surveyor, or else an architect, who shall carefully exa- mine whether the lake is higher than the seathe experts in these parts contending that it is higher by forty cubits. I find that a trench was cut in this identical direction by the king;* but it is uncertain whether this was done for the purpose of collecting the moisture from the surrounding country, or in order to turn the lake into the river. For it is not completed. And this, too, is doubtful, whether the king was arrested by death, or whether he despaired of carrying through the work.

So, bear- ing in mind your course of action, I deemed it right to keep back the envoy and to send on the decree, that at the same time the expense might be lightened and a public duty fulfilled. The same city was debited with three thousand sesterces,-f-which, under the head of travelling expenses, were given annually to the envoy who went to pay his respects publicly to the Governor of Mcesia. These sums, I considered, ought for the future to be cut down.

Their probity should therefore be rewarded, and they should at once be told that in inspecting the accounts you will be acting by my orders, without prejudice to the prerogatives they enjoy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="49">(58).</head><p>To Teajan.</p><p>Before my arrival, sir, the inhabitants of Nicomedia had begun to add a new Forum to their old one, in a corner of which is a temple of the great mother of the gods,* which must be either rebuilt or removed, parti- cularly as it is much lower than the construction which is at the present moment rising. When I inquired whether the temple had been in any way formally con- secrated, I learnt that the mode of dedication here differs from ours. Consider, then, sir, whether you think that a temple which has not been formally consecrated can be * Cybele.</p><p>removed without prejudice to religion.

Nor need you be troubled about finding no form of dedication, since the soil of a foreign city does not admit of the kind of dedication which takes place under our laws.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="51">(12).</head><p>To Teajan.</p><p>It is difficult, sir, to express in words the great pleasure which I felt at your consenting, at the request of my mother-in-law and myself, to transfer her relative Cselius Clemens to this province.

Con- sider then, sir, whether you think that the rate of interest should be lowered, and by these means eligible borrowers be attracted, and if even thus such persons are not to be found, whether the money should be distributed among the Decurions, * on condition of their furnishing proper security to the state; which arrangementthough they may not like it, and may be for declining itwould be made less burdensome, in consequence of a lower rate of interest having been fixed. o 55 (63).</p><p>Trajan to Pliny.</p><p>I myself can perceive no other remedy, my dearest Secundus, than that the rate of interest should be lowered, in order to facilitate the investment of the public moneys.

For this reason, I have thought it necessary to refer the matter in its entirety to you. For though it was provided in your mandates that I was not to reinstate persons banished by a former governor, or by myself, yet nothing was included in them on the subject of those who had been both banished and reinstated by a former governor. Therefore you, sir, had to be consulted as to what practice you would have me follow, as also, by Hercules, with regard to those who, though banished for life and never reinstated, are caught in the province.</p><p>For this particular case too has fallen under my cognisance.</p><p>A person was brought before me who was banished for life by Julius Bassus, the proconsul. Knowing that the acts of Bassus had been rescinded, and that the Senate had given to all those who had been the subjects of any of his decisions the right of trying the matter afresh, that is during a period of two years, I inquired of this person whom Bassus had banished, whether he had gone to the BOOK X.</p><p>357 proconsul and instructed him.</p><p>He said he had not.</p><p>Hence I was brought to consult you as to whether he should be remitted to his punishment or whether you think that some still heavier penalty, and if so what particular one, should be constituted for him and for those, if such there happen to be, who may be found in a like case.</p><p>I have appended to this letter the decree of Calvus and the edict, also the decree of <ref type="bibr">Bassus. 57 (65.)</ref> Tkajan to Pliny.</p><p>As to the determination to be arrived at in the case of those persons who, having been banished for three years by P.

The man who was banished for life by Julius Bassusinasmuch as he had the power of taking action for the space of two years, in case he thought himself unjustly banished, and yet failed to do this, and moreover persisted in tarrying in the provincemust be sent a prisoner to my Praetorian prefects.

A decision of Velius Paulus, the proconsul, was cited, proving Archippus to have been condemned to the mines on a charge of forgery.</p><p>He brought forward nothing to show that he had been reinstated ; he alleged, however, in favour of his reinstate- ment, a memorial presented by himself to Domitian, and ""etters of the latter in which he was honourably mentioned, ^s also as a decree of the Prusenses, To these he added a letter written to him by yourself too, and an edict and a letter of your father confirming the favours granted by Domitian.

All this, however, my dearest Secundus, must not go so far as to make you think you should be the slower to hear, in case anything in the shape of a fresh charge is brought against him.

I, however, who am on the spot, fancy I have discovered a way of obviating this danger. The lake may be brought by means of a canal up to the river, and yet not be dis- charged into it, but be at the same time retained and kept separate from it, by leaving, as it were, a margin between the two. By this means we shall obtain as a result, that while the lake shall not seem to be emptied by being poured into the river, yet it will be as good as poured into it.</p><p>For over this very small intermediate space it will be easy to transport to the river the cargoes brought to that point by means of the canal. The work will be so executed if necessity compels, though I hope it will not * See Letter 41 of this book. BOOK X. 361 compel. For not only is the lake sufficiently high of itself, but also at the present moment it discharges a river on the opposite side, which may be dammed off from that direction, and diverted as we wish, and so, without any loss to the lake, be made to give all the water which it now carries. Moreover, on the ground along which the canal will have to be made, rivulets occur which, if they are carefully collected, will add to what the lake gives us. If, again, it be decided to prolong the canal, to dig it narrower, and to bring it on a level with the sea, and so to make it communicate not with the river but with the sea itself, the counter-pressure of the sea will preserve and keep back whatever comes from the lake. If the nature of the locality allowed of nothing of this kind, yet it would be easy to check the rapidity of the stream by means of sluices. However, these and other matters will be inquired into and investigated with much more sagacity by the surveyor whom you, sir, ought clearly to send according to promise.</p><p>For the matter is one worthy of your greatness and your attention, I meanwhile have written to that distinguished man, Calpurnius Macer, at your suggestion, to send me as competent a surveyor as possible.</p></div>

Lycormas, your freedman, has written me word, sir, that if any embassy came here from Bosphorus, on its way to Eome, it should be detained till his arrival, Now no embassy has as yet come, at any rate to the city in which I am : but a courier has come from the king of Sarmatia : and availing myself of the opportunity which chance offered, I have thought it right to send him on in company with the courier who preceded Lycormas, that you might be informed at the same time, by the letters of Lycormas and those of the king, of matters which perhaps ought to come to your knowledge at one and the same time.</p></div>

A great question, sir, and one affecting the whole pro- vince, is that of the status and keep of those who are called " foundlings."</p><p>In this matter, after hearing the constitutions of the Emperors, as I could find nothing in them either of a particular or a general kind applicable to the Bithynians, I have judged it proper to consult you as to the course you would have pursued: nor, indeed, did I think that in a matter demanding your supreme judgment I could possibly be satisfied with a mere pre- BOOK X.</p><p>363 cedent.</p><p>An edict was, however, cited to me, which was said to be one by the Emperor Augustus relating to Annia. Letters were also cited of the Emperor Vespasian to the LacedaBmonians, of the Emperor Titus to the same, and of Domitian to the proconsuls Avidius Nigrinus and Armenius Brocchus, also to the Lacedaemonians. These I have not sent to you, because they seemed to me to be mere rough drafts and some of them of doubtful authenticity, and because I believe the genuine and corrected letters to be among your archives.</p></div>

This questionrelating to those who, born free, have been exposed, and have been subsequently taken up by certain parties and reared in servitudehas been often treated of ; yet there is nothing to be found in the commentaries of the Emperors who have preceded me, in the shape of a settled rule for all the provinces. There are, to be sure, letters of Domitian to Avidius Nigrinus and Armenius Brocchus, which, perhaps, ought to be had in regard, but between those provinces which are the subjects of his rescript . . . among which is Bithynia. I think, therefore, that an adjudication of freedom should not be refused to those who claim their liberty on these grounds,* and, moreover, that this same liberty does not need to be purchased at the price of their keep.</p></div>

I have thought these circumstances should be brought to your knowledge, because I recently wrote to you that Lycormas had asked me to detain till his arrival any embassy that might come from Bosphorus. No satisfactory reason occurs to me for doing this any longer, particularly as the letters of Lycor- mas (which I was unwilling, as I have before told you, to detain) seemed likely to precede this ambassador by some days.</p></div>

Knowing that at Rome, in cases of this kind, application is wont to be made to the Pontifical College, I have thought it right to consult you, sir, who are Pontifex Maximus, as to what course you would have me follow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="69">(74).</head><p>Trajan to Pliny.</p><p>It would be hard to inflict on the provincials the neces- sity of applying to the Pontifices, if they are desirous, on any good grounds, of transferring the ashes of their rela- tives from the place where these lie to some other. You should, therefore, rather follow the precedents of those who have governed that province : and give the permis- sion, or refuse it in each case, according to the merits.</p><p>BOOK X. 365 70 (75).</p><p>To TllAJAN.</p><p>On my inquiring, sir, whereabouts in Prusa the hatha which you have accorded could be built, I pitched upon a spot where there was once, I am told, a fine house, now an unsightly ruin. In this way we shall insure that the extremely filthy aspect of the city will be improved, and even that the city itself will be enlarged, without any buildings being pulled down, but such as are crumbling with age being rebuilt on a larger and improved scale.</p><p>The circumstances of this house, however, are as follows. Claudius Polysenus left it by will to Claudius Caesar, with the injunction that a temple should be raised to him in the peristyle, and the rest of the house should be let. For some time the commonwealth derived a revenue from it : afterwards, by degrees, partly through plunder, partly through neglect, the whole house has tumbled to pieces, peristyle included : and indeed by this time hardly any- thing of it remains but the ground on which it stood. If you, sir, would either make a present of this ground to the state, or order it to be sold, the act would be received as a great boon, on account of the eligibility of the site.</p><p>For my part, if you will allow me, I design to place the baths where the open court was, and to enclose the place where the buildings were with a vestibule and colonnades to be dedicated to you, the benefactor to whom will be owing this handsome construction, worthy of your name. I have forwarded you a copy, though it is an imperfect one, of the will.</p><p>From this you will see that Polysenus left many things for the adornment of this same house, which have disappeared with the house itself. However, I will make as diligent inquiry as possible for them. than plebeians. Having been asked for my opinion by the Censors elect, I thought that those under thirty years of age who had held office might be chosen senators, in accordance both with the edict of Augustus and the law of Pompey : inasmuch as Augustus had allowed persons under thirty to hold office, and the law enacted that he who had held office should be a senator. As to such as had not held it, although of the same age as those who had been allowed to hold it, I hesitated. Hence I have been brought to consult you, sir, as to what course you would have followed, I have appended to this edict the heads of the law, also the edict of Augustus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="80">(84).</head><p>Teajan to Pliny.</p><p>I agree with you, dearest Secundus, in your interpretation, that Pompey's law has been amended by the Emperor Augustus's edict so far as this, that persons can be admitted to public offices, who are not under twenty- two years of age, and that such as had been so admitted should find their way into the Senate of each common- wealth. But, where no office has been entered on, I do not think that those who are under thirty years are cap- able of being chosen senators in their several localities, on the ground that they are eligible for such offices.</p></div>

While I was employed in public business in my own apartments at Prusa under Mount Olympus, sir, being about to leave the same day, Asclepiades, a magistrate, announced that an appeal had been lodged with me by Claudius Eumolpus. Coccianus Dion having moved in the Council that a construction which he had had the charge of should be assigned to the city, thereupon BOOK X. ^^Ê umolpus, backed by Flavins Arcliippus, declared that Dion should be required to furnish the accounts relatino- to the construction before it was handed over to the city, on the ground of his not having acted as he ought to have done.</p><p>He added, moreover, that in this same construction there were placed, together with your statue, the corpses of interred personsthose of Dion's wife and son ; and he demanded that I should try the matter publicly.* Upon my telling him that I would immediately do this, and would adjourn my departure accordingly, he asked me to grant a longer interval for the purpose of getting up the case, and to try it in some other city. I replied that I would hear it at Mcsea. When I had taken my seat there for the purpose of trying it, the same Eumolpus, on the plea of not yet being sufficiently prepared, began by asking for an adjournment : Dion, on the other hand, demanded that it should be heard. A great deal was said on both sides, and on the merits of the case as well. Tor my part, being of opinion that an adjournment should be granted, and counsel taken of you in a matter likely to form a pre- cedent, I told each side to give in a written statement of their respective demands, for I desired that you should know what was put forward, above all things, in the very words of the parties themselves. Dion said he would give this in, and Eumolpus replied that he would include in a written statement his claims on behalf of the commonwealth ; but that as regarded the interred bodies, he was not the accuser, but only the advocate of Elavius Archippus, whose instructions he had obeyed. Arcliippus, however, who stood by Eumolpus here as at Prusa, said that he would hand in a statement. Such being the case, neither Eumolpus nor Archipjius, though waited for for many days, have as yet sent me their statements. Dion has sent his, which I have joined to this letter. I myself went to the spot, and saw that your statue was added to To Teajan. Nymphidius Lupus, sir, a former Primipilus,* was my comrade in arms at the time when I myself was Tribune and he was Praefect. From that time I began to cherish him closely. Subsequently my regard for him grew from the very length of our mutual friendship. On the strength of this, I have laid violent hands on his repose, and have forced him to assist me with his counsel in Bithynia. This he has not only already done, but will continue to do in the most friendly way, and laying aside all considerations of ease and age. For these reasons I reckon his belongings among my own, and particularly his son Nymphidius Lupus, a young man of probity and energy, one in every way worthy of his distinguished father, and who will do credit to your indulgent notice of him. This indeed you may learn from the first proofs he has given as Prajfect of a cohort, in which capacity he gained the highest character from those eminent men, Julius Perox and Fuscus Sali- nator.</p><p>My joy and self-congratulation will be satisfied by the advancement of the son.</p></div>

There were others afflicted with like madness, with regard to whom, as they were Eoman citizens, I made a memorandum that they were to be sent for judgment to Eome. / Soon, the very handling of this matter causing, as often happens, the area of the charge to spread, many fresh examples occurred.</p><p>An anonymous paper was put forth containing the names of many persons.

All these, too, not only honoured your image and the effigies of the gods, but also reviled Christ. They affirmed, however, that this had been the sum, whether of their crime or their delusion ; they had been in the habit of meeting together on a stated day, before sunrise, and of offering in turns a form of invocation to Christ, as to a god ; also of binding themselves by an oath, not for any guilty purpose, but not to commit thefts, or robberies, or adulteries, not BOOK X. 379 to break their word, not to repudiate deposits when called upon ; these ceremonies having been gone through, they had been in the habit of separating, and again meeting together for the purpose of taking foodfood, that is, of an ordinary and innocent kind.</p><p>They had, however, ceased from doing even this, after my edict, in which, following your orders, I had forbidden the existence of Fraternities.</p><p>This made me think it all the more neces- sary to inquire, even by torture, of two maid-servants, who were styled deaconesses, what the truth was.

I have thought it necessary to consult you as to what you would have observed. I have appended to this letter the principal clauses of the law.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="115">(116).</head><p>Trajan to Pliny.</p><p>!N"o wonder you were in doubt, dearest Secundus, as to the proper reply for you to make to the censors who consulted you. . . . For the authority of the law on the one hand, and, on the other, the long usage which has obtained in opposition to the law, might well move you in opposite directions.</p><p>I have decided upon thus compromising the matter : that we make no change in what is past, but that the citizens who have been naturalised, though illegally, of BOOK X. 387 whatever city they be, shall remain where they are ; for the future, however, that Pompey's law be observed. If we were for maintaining its provisions retrospectively as well, much disturbance would necessarily follow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="116">(117).</head><p>To Trajan.</p><p>Persons who attain their majority, or contract a mar- riage, or enter on a public office, or inaugurate a public work, are in the habit of inviting the whole of the council, and even a considerable number of the population, and presenting them with a couple of denarii,* and sometimes one, per man. I should be obliged by your writing me word whether you think these celebrations should be per- mitted, and if so, how far. For my part, although I am of opinion that the right to issue invitations should be conceded, especially on solemn occasions, yet at the same time I fear that those who invite a thousand individuals, and sometimes even more, may seem to exceed the bounds, and to fall into an appearance of distributing largesses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="117">(118).</head><p>Trajan to Pliny.</p><p>No wonder you are afraid that an invitation " should fall into an appearance of distributing largesses," which not only exceeds the bounds in point of numbers, but also collects together to a ceremonious dole people in bands, so to speak, not man by man, each one on grounds of personal acquaintance.</p><p>But I have made choice of your intelligence on this very account, that in forming the manners of that province of yours you should yourself ordain and establish what may be of advantage to the permanent quiet of the province.</p><p>* The denarius was worth about eightpence-halfpeDny.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>118(119).</head><p>To Tkajan.   The athletes, sir, consider that the rewards which you have established in the case of the Iselastic * contests are owing to them from the very day on which they were crowned; for they say it is not at all material at what time they made their public entry into their native place, but at what time they were victors in the contest, by reason of which they were empowered to make such entry.</p><p>I, on the other hand, observe that they have been given under the name of " Iselastic ; " and this makes me strongly inclined to doubt whether it be not rather the time of their making their public entry which must be looked at.</p><p>These same persons ask for pensions in the case of a contest, which has been made an Iselastic one by you, though they should have been victors before it was so made. For they say it is only consistent that just as this money is not given them for those contests which have ceased to be Iselastic after th6ir victory, so it should be given to them for those which have begun to be Iselastic after their victory.</p><p>Here, too, I am in no small doubt whether one can take account of what is past, and whether anything should be given them which was not owing to them at the time when they were victors. I pray you, then, to deign to determine my doubts, that is to say, to interpret your own benefactions.</p></div>

BOOK X. 389 from the time when a man has made his personal entry into his own city. Pensions for those contests which I have been pleased to make Iselastic, in case they were not Iselastic before, are not due retrospectively. Nor can it avail in view of the athletes' request, that they ceased to receive these monies for those contests which subsequently to their victory I decided should not be Iselastic. For though the character of these contests was changed, never- theless what these people had previously received is not asked for back again.

For thouQ;h he had held himself out as a bait to fortune-hunters, he left as his heiress a daughter who was common to himself and his brother, that is to say, she was his brother's child and he had adopted her.</p><p>Upon his grandsons he bestowed many very acceptable legacies, and even one on his great-grandson. In short, all his dispositions are replete with just affection, and they seem all the more so in that they were unexpected. Accordingly, various are the comments which are being made all over the city : some speak of him as a hypocrite, without gratitude and without memory, and, while they inveigh against him, betray their own selves by their disgraceful avowals, complaining * as they do of a man who was a father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, just as though he had been childless : others, on the contrary, laud him in this very particular that he has frustrated the impudent expectations of men whom thus to deceive, in the present state of society, is an act of prudence.</p><p>They even add that he was not free to leave any other will behind him ; for that he did not so much bequeath property to his daughter as restore that by which he had been enriched through the medium of this same dauejhter.</p><p>For, Curtilius Mancia, detesting his son-in-law, Domitius Lucanus (the brother of TuUus), constituted the daughter of the latterhis own grandchild -his heiress, subject to the condition of her having been emancipated from the control of her father. Her father had emancipated her, upon which her uncle had adopted her, and the intention * See vii. 31 and note.</p><p>BOOK VIII. 279 of the will having been cheated in this fashion, one brotherthey being joint-owners of theu' estate -got the emancipated daughter back under the parental authority of the other brother, thanks to his fraudulent adoption, and that too with the most extensive property.</p><p>In other cases it seemed as it were the fate of these brothers to become rich even against the strongest inclinations of those who had made them so. Indeed, Domi- tius Afer, who adopted them, left a will declared before witnesses eighteen years previously, and so highly disapproved by him at a subsequent period that he caused their father's property to be confiscated. Strange, ruth- lessness on his part, and strange good fortune on theirs ! Euthlessness in him to cut off from the roll of citizens a man who was his partner in such a matter as that of children : good fortune for them to have as successor in the place of father the very man who had taken off their father.</p><p>But this property derived from Afer, together with every- thing else which he had acquired in company with his brother, Tullus was bound to transmit to the daughter of his brother, who had constituted him sole heir and pre- ferred him to his daughter, in order to conciliate his favour.</p><p>The more praiseworthy is this will which affection, good faith, and honour have dictated ; in which, finally, all degrees of relationship are acknowledged according to their several obligations, and acknowledgment is made to the testator's wife as well.</p><p>She takes some charming country residences and a large sum of money, does this most excellent and long-suffering of wives : ay, and one who deserved all the better of her husband in proportion as she was blamed for marrying him. For this lady, who was of illustrious birth and spotless character, in the de- cline of life, after a long widowhood, and having aforetime borne children, was thought to have acted with no very good taste in prosecuting a marriage with a rich old man, such a prey to disease that he might well have been an object of disgust even to a wife whom he had wedded in PLINY'S LETTERS.</p></div>

Being brought before the magistrates, he declared that he had formerly been in the service of Laberius Maximus, that he was made prisoner by Susacrus in Moesia, and sent by Decebalus as a present to Pacorus, the king of Parthia, In his service he remained for a number of years, and subsequently made his escape, and so came to Nicomedia. I had him brought before me, and, on his repeating the same story, have thought it right to send him to you. This I have delayed doing for a short time, while I searched for a gem which he declared had been stolen from him, and which contained the portrait of Pacorus in his insignia.

Consider whether you are of opinion that a similar privilege might be conferred on the inhabitants of Juliopolis. Their city, being but a very small one, has very great burdens to bear : and is exposed to oppressions which are all the heavier in pro- portion to its weakness. Moreover, whatever you accord to the people of Juliopolis will be of service to the whole province.</p><p>For they are at the entrance of Bithynia, and give passage to most of those who resort to it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="78">(82).</head><p>Teajan to Pliny.</p><p>The condition of the city of Byzantium is such, owing to the great confluence of travellers into it from all parts, BOOK X. 369 that, in accordance with the usage of previous times, I considered it proper to provide for its repute by a Legionary- Centurion's guard. If we shall think fit to assist the people of Juliopolis in the same way, we shall be burden- ing ourselves with a precedent. A number of others, and all the more so, the weaker they are, will be making the same request. I have such confidence in your diligence as to believe that you will use every exertion to prevent their being exposed to acts of oppression. If, however, any persons shall behave themselves contrary to my in- junctions, let them be at once imprisoned: or.: if their offences are too great to be adequately punished in a summary way;* in case they are soldiers, inform their generals of what you have discovered : in case they are coming to Eome, write to me.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="79">(83).</head><p>To Teajan.</p><p>It was provided, sir, by a law of Pompey's given to the Bithynians, that no person should hold a public office, or sit in the Senate, under the age of thirty years. The same law included a provision that those who had been admitted to public offices should sit in the Senate. After this came an edict of the Emperor Augustus, allowing younger men to take office, the limit being two and twenty years.</p><p>The question is, then, whether a man under thirty years of age, who has held office can be chosen by the Censors as a senator ? And if he can, whether such also as have not held it, can, by a like interpretation, be chosen senators from the same age at which it is allowed them to hold an office ? a thing which, besides f has not only been often done up to the present time, but is even said to be necessary, since it is somewhat better that the sons of men of position should be admitted into the Senate rather * Literally " on the spot." equivalent to the French " d'ail-+ Alioij^ui.

I pray, sir, that you would deign to direct me, especially in such a kind of investigation as this, as to which, moreover, great interest is felt.</p><p>Indeed this must be the case in a matter where the charge is at the same time acknowledged and defended by precedents.</p></div>

Leaving out of the question, then, an inquiry which I should not entertain even if it were supported by precedents, let the entire accounts of the construction carried out under the super- vision of Coccianus Dion be investigated, since this is a course demanded by the interests of the city, and wliich Dion neither can oppose nor is entitled to oppose.</p></div>

You will have to convoke all persons concerned in this business, summoning to your assistance Virbius Gemellinus and Epimachus, my freed- man, the imperial agents, in order that, having likewise duly weighed what is urged on the opposite side, you may together determine as you shall judge best.</p></div>
