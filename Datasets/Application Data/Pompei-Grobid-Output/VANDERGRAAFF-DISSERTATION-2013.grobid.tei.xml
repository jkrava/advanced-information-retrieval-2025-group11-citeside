Clarke and Penelope J.E. Davies Fortifications often represent the largest and most extensive remains present on archaeological sites. Their massive scale is the primary reason for their survival and reflects the considerable resources that communities invested in their construction. Yet, until recently, they have largely remained underrepresented as monuments in studies on the ancient city. Beyond their defensive function city walls constituted an essential psychological boundary protecting communities from unpredictable elements including war, brigandage, and more elusive natural forces. These factors have led scholars to identify fortifications as playing a distinct role in the definition of a civic identity.</p><p>Nevertheless, beyond the recognition of some general trends, a definitive diachronic study of their performance within a single urban matrix is still lacking. This dissertation examines the city walls of Pompeii as an active monument rather than a static defensive enclosure. The city preserves one of the most intact set of defenses surviving since antiquity which, in various shapes and forms, served as one its defining elements for over 600 years. Pompeii's fortifications, through construction techniques, materials, and embellishments, engaged in an explicit architectural dialogue with the city, its urban development, and material culture. Their basic framework changed in response to military developments, but their appearance is also the result of specific political and viii ideological choices. As a result, the city walls carried aesthetic and ideological associations reflecting the social and political organization of the community.</p><p>This study is the first of its kind. It provides a diachronic examination of the Pompeian fortifications by assessing their role in the social and architectural definition of the city. The walls were subject to appropriation and change in unison with the ambitions of the citizens of Pompeii. From their original construction through subsequent modifications, the fortifications expressed multivalent political, religious, and social meanings, particular to specific time periods in Pompeii. This analysis reveals a monument in continuous flux that changed its ideological meaning and relationship to civic identity, in response to the major historical and social developments affecting the city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>If our conclusions are just, not only should cities have walls, but care should be taken to make them ornamental, as well as useful for warlike purposes, and adapted to resist modern inventions. For as the assailants of a city do all they can to gain an advantage, so the defenders should make use of any means of defense which have been already discovered, and should devise and invent others, for when men are well prepared no enemy even thinks of attacking them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Aristotle</head><p>The aim of this dissertation is to assess the role of fortifications in the establishment of a civic identity for ancient Pompeii. Although fortifications often constitute the most tangible archaeological remains of settlements, scholars have paid little attention to their intrinsic monumental character. In fact, city walls remain largely neglected as monuments despite their standing as one of the major communal investments in urban frameworks. Their sheer scale translated to copious expenditures of resources even on small refurbishments or the erection of single towers and gates. On an architectural level their imposing height, thickness, and elegant masonry carried an unmistakable aesthetic element representing the city and its social hierarchy.</p><p>Architecture, almost by definition, imposes an experience by announcing defined spaces and directing a viewer through them. Fortifications did this on a grand scale enclosing entire cities for centuries after their construction. Defenses often dictated the future urban layout of cities leading to their role in influencing issues of design and development.</p><p>These factors ensured that city walls not only responded to military considerations, but also embodied the identity of the city and its inhabitants.</p><p>Many scholars agree that city walls formed part of the image of an ideal city, yet a diachronic examination of their performance within a single urban matrix is still lacking.</p><p>Questions remain: What were the dynamics shaping this identity? What roles did fortifications play in the ever changing social realities of a city? This study focuses on a single site and will concentrate on the social, urban, and cultural context of the city walls at Pompeii, treating them as an active monumental boundary marker rather than a static defensive element. The circumstances at Pompeii provide a unique platform for such an analysis: an exceptionally well preserved fortification system, and a wealth of information concerning the social structure and genesis of the city. In addition, preserved graffiti, inscriptions, frescoes, and reliefs provide primary sources on how individuals perceived the structure.</p><p>The origins of Pompeii as a settlement remain shrouded in mystery; archaeological investigations have only recently started uncovering evidence for the earliest a settlement. Traces of a Bronze Age Palma Campania settlement have surfaced in the highest portions of the plateau near the current Porta Vesuvio, but this phase seems brief, giving way to a considerable hiatus in the archaeological evidence. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Scholars often trace the first signs of an organized settlement to the construction of the Temple of Apollo, the Doric Temple in the Triangular Forum, and the first line of fortifications in the sixth century BCE. Yet a few scant remains suggest that the areas the two temples 1 M. Nilsson, "Evidence of Palma Campania Settlement at Pompeii."

Guidobaldi (Rome, 2008), 354-359.  saw some sort of settlement or frequentation stretching through the ninth and eighth centuries BCE. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Given the italicizing elements of the early Temple of Apollo and the Hellenizing aspects of the Doric Temple, scholars have traced both Etruscan and Greek influences for the foundation of the city. A possibility exists that early Pompeii was first founded as a sanctuary, that later attracted a settlement around it as was sometimes the case in Etruria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b447">3</ref> In this role the site perhaps functioned as a sacred emporium for the Sarno Valley in a similar fashion to the emporia of Pyrgi and Gravisca for the Etruscan cities of Cerveteri and Tarquinia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b448">4</ref> Excavations have found evidence for a possible sacred grove associated with the surviving votive column in the House of the Etruscan Column (VI.5.17). Its presence further supports the hypothesis that early Pompeii was a sanctuary, but a clear picture for this earliest phase can only come with further investigations. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Given the paucity of evidence, this analysis will begin with the first tangible signs of an organized settlement coinciding with the construction of the first walled circuit.</p><p>The current city walls of Pompeii form an elliptical circuit some 3.2 km long (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">1</ref>). Seven gates, the Porta Stabia, Nocera, Sarno, Nola, Vesuvio, Ercolano, and Marina pierce the line; whereas twelve towers, sequentially numbered in a counterclockwise direction, further fortify it. The principal gates open along the main arteries of the city, and the towers invariably line up at the end of smaller roads. This setup essentially anchors the urban layout of Pompeii.

The third limestone circuit subsequently witnessed at least four further upgrades and modifications spanning the remainder of Pompeian history. Amedeo Maiuri first formulated the current wall sequence using a combination of excavations and previous scholarship. Although scholars have frequently revised the construction dates, they have largely maintained his periodization. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The long and complex debate concerning the dating and phasing of the walls is a matter that will receive further attention in the following chapter.

The first fortification, the socalled pappamonte wall, dates to the sixth century BCE. The wall takes its name after the friable tufa, known locally as pappamonte, used to build it.

They probably were part of a terracing wall holding an earth embankment known as an agger. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The next wall, built in the early fifth century BCE, ran roughly along the same course. Scholars refer to it as the orthostate wall because of the relatively thin, vertically set, slabs of Sarno limestone used to build it (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">3</ref>). It featured two facing wall façades set some four meters apart. Engineers filled the intervening space with earth according to the typically Greek construction technique known as emplecton. It protected the city for the next few hundred years until the turn of the third century BCE when construction of the third circuit led to its demolition. The knowledge these two early enceintes is primarily the result of excavations and their original appearance, as we shall see, is somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, they shaped the future city designating the locations of gates and anchoring the urban layout of Pompeii for centuries to come.</p><p>The next wall dates to the turn of the third century BCE. Scholars also refer to it as the Limestone enceinte, or the first Samnite wall. It formed the basis for the currently visible fortified system, which essentially is the result of a series of subsequent upgrades.</p><p>Mostly built in ashlar masonry, known as opus quadratum, this third enceinte featured an outer wall built using rectangular limestone blocks laid out in a relatively regular header and stretcher system. It acted as an enormous terracing wall supporting a large agger, or earthen embankment, behind it. The gates currently visible in the circuit largely follow the same layout designed for this enceinte. Scholars assign them to the forecourt type 10 F.

Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae (Rome, 2006), 29.  featuring a deep passageway through the agger reinforced with two forward bastions and a two-leafed gate closing the rear (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">4</ref>). <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The following intervention on the defenses dates to the time of the Second Punic War. It featured the addition of an internal retaining wall, and the raising of the agger and the outer façade in tufa. The reinforcement resulted in a double parapet creating a deep defensive line and a wider wall-walk (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">5</ref>). The next reinforcement occurred at the turn of the first century BCE. Engineers primarily used opus incertum, a crude cement faced with small stones, to build vaults in the gates and the towers dotting the circuit. After the installation of the Roman colony in 80 BCE the walls first received a broad refurbishment the extent of which is still debated. They subsequently weakened gradually in the Imperial period. The following earthquake that devastated Pompeii in 62 CE also damaged the walls. The city directed some resources to rebuild the gates, but the curtain wall became a large open air quarry used in the reconstruction effort.</p><p>The interventions on the fortifications are often pivotal events and the deliberate chronological organization of this dissertation reflects those trends. Each chapter considers the appearance of the city walls in their main phases of development, and contextualizes them in the known social and political make-up of the city. The nature of the evidence at Pompeii, a city excavated almost exclusively to its 79 CE level, means that our knowledge of its development in earlier periods decreases dramatically. As a result, the first chapters analyzing earliest Pompeii focus primarily on known archaeological and architectural remains. The results will provide a basic framework for the subsequent chapters where new forms of evidence, including social expressions 11 G. Brands, Republikanische Stadttore in Italien (Oxford, 1988), 8-29. Generally speaking, as described in the following chapters, individual construction techniques highlight the various architectural elements and building sequence of the gates. Engineers first employed Limestone in the bastions and court, followed by a tufa substitution of the court masonry, and completed by an opus incertum vault on the inside of the city.</p><p>directly related to the fortifications, allow for wider avenues of research. This study shows that the Pompeian fortifications were an integral part of the city's development and its identity. They incorporated aesthetic and religious elements that inevitably linked to distinct political messages of power that changed and were manipulated over time. The results presented here should add to our view on Pompeian fortifications and antiquity in general, thereby creating new avenues of inquiry on the dynamics of settlement, identity, and conquest.</p><p>The motivation to carry out this investigation comes from the relative neglect of the city walls in the scholarly discourse concerning the image of the city. In fact, major syntheses of their appearance, role in the community, and even the history of their excavation are still lacking. Similarly, despite their massive scale, no accurate plan or published survey of the current remains exists. The towers in particular are a singular example of this state of affairs. Although scholars often describe them according to the best preserved layouts of Towers X-XII, a basic visual survey, discussed further in chapter four, highlights the existence of at least four distinct types of structures. This situation is symptomatic of Pompeii as an archaeological site, where hundreds of years of excavation have produced a massive published scholarly corpus that sometimes lacks basic architectural plans. This situation is due, in large part, to differing recording standards as archaeology developed as a discipline. This study is therefore also important because it synthesizes large amounts of scattered information concerning the fortifications of Pompeii. As a result, this dissertation focuses heavily on the Pompeian remains and limits its assessment of external comparisons and influences on their design. These factors will necessarily have to be examined in a more expansive approach that builds on the results of this study.</p><p>A useful introduction to the importance of fortifications in the development of a communal identity is to trace their role in the urbanization process. The construction of fortifications in antiquity entailed diverse anthropological concerns pertaining to the genesis of a communal identity. These included the protection of the territorial, economic, religious, and political interests of a community and went hand in hand with the development of city states. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Defense is a main factor behind the origins of urbanization and fortifications gradually evolved in step with urban development and the formation of institutions. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Strongholds in particular allowed small communities to retain their cultural autonomy and, as a last line of defense, they placed their most prized assets, including gods, wealth, and magistrates, within their confines to keep them safe. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Relatively small bands of soldiers could easily use the enclosure to hold out against a numerically superior enemy and the population felt safer inside the stronghold rather than facing invading forces out in the open. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The refuge also functioned actively as a staging point to protect the territory. Defenders could exploit their intimate knowledge of the terrain to set devastating ambushes and launch effective counterattacks to defend critical unmovable elements such as fields, pastures, water sources, hunting areas, sources of raw materials, and trade routes. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Therefore, the construction of defenses signaled a community's territorial assertions toward outsiders and reflected the symbolic boundary 12 M.J. Rowlands, "Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements." In Man, Settlement and Urbanism. Proceedings of a Meeting of the Research Seminar on Archaeology and Related Subjects (London, 1972), 447. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> A. Gat, "Why City States Existed? Riddles and Clues of Urbanisation and Fortifications." In A Comparative Study of Six City-State Cultures; an Investigation Conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre (Copenhagen, 2000), 127. 14 Y. Garlan, "Fortifications et histoire Grècque." In Problèmes de la guerre en Grèce ancienne (Paris,  1968), 245. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> A.W. Lawrence, Greek Aims in Fortification (Oxford 1979), 113. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Rowlands, "Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements," 448.  between the collective dwelling and the outside world. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">17</ref> Such territorial claims also expressed the emotional and historical ties binding a community to a specific region and increased the feeling of security against outsiders.</p><p>Warfare constituted a main factor in the drive toward urbanized society. For example, during the Roman Republic ten percent of freeborn men annually joined the army and modern estimates of state expenditure on military budgets suggest an amount as much as seventy to eighty percent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">18</ref> These numbers highlight the social importance warfare and fortifications played in the development of cultural identities. M.H. Hansen broadly defined the concept of a city-state, or polis, as an institutionalized and centralized micro-state consisting of a defended town, its immediate hinterland, and a stratified society inhabiting it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">19</ref> Its origins lie in the need of small communities to unite as an answer to the mutual necessity of defense. Simple raids into enemy territory were a main characteristic of early warfare and these tactics resulted in the establishment of small enclosures where people and their movable possessions found temporary refuge. These safe havens may not have featured fortifications, relying instead on the natural strength of a position to discourage direct assaults and the grouping of people to neutralize the potential of surprise attacks and enhance overall security. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">20</ref> Dominant patterns of warfare-whether seasonal or year-round affairs, whether conducted by raiding parties or complex armies-influenced settlement location. In turn, the development of the settlement was contingent on its location for the survival capabilities it offered and the contacts it could uphold with the outside world. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> The danger outside aggression posed was a principal reason that led communities to build defenses, but banditry and wild animals also posed threats that led to the construction of defenses. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> In this context fortifications also formed an essential psychological barrier protecting the community. The presence of dangerous wild-animal species within the perimeter of the city was also particularly inauspicious. For example, the spotting of a wild wolf within the walled circuit was one of the worst omens that could befall Rome or a Roman city. Wolves symbolized savage uncontrolled spaces and related to death and war. Their entry into the civilized space of the city also was an affront to its protective gods and symbolized the invasion of uncontrolled forces into the world controlled by men. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Similarly, fortifications also kept out unwanted elements such as bandits, robbers, and thieves, or the outside 'other', that did not belong to the community. As outcasts they often lived in the countryside outside of the confines of the city. As a result, city walls also defined control exercised within their confines and the territory associated with the city, as opposed to the outside chaos that threatened the community. In short, they marked the symbolic boundary of the civilized versus the uncivilized. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Beyond looming external threats, internal social, economic, and political factors influenced the construction of fortifications. Communities decided to build fortifications either in response to a direct threat, or if they gained enough wealth to construct them in <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Rowlands, "Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements," 454. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Rowlands, "Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements," 453. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> On the matter see J. Trinquier, "Les loups sont entrés dans la ville: De la peur du loup a la hantise de la cité ensauvagée." In Les espaces du sauvage dans le monde antique: Approches et définitions (Franche-Comté, 2004), <ref type="bibr">85-118. 24</ref> E. Salomon, Roman Colonization under the Republic (New York, 1970), 17.  anticipation of any future trouble. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Strongholds and refuges sometimes evolved into cities and towns. Whether or not they became urbanized, the presence of strongholds also entailed a degree of social control. Troop concentrations within their confines could contain revolts from fortified positions or move quickly into the surrounding territory.</p><p>When applied to foreign politics this tactic featured the deliberate implantation of colonies inside enemy territory in order to force acceptance of a dominating culture.</p><p>Because internal politics in particular played a role in the design of fortifications, several different types of government may be evident in a specific region. Recently, scholars who have built upon Aristotelian ideas have characterized fortification types and defensive tactics according to social structures. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> For example, small fortified enclosures scattered throughout a territory may signal an effort to defend the property of an elite landowning class, whereas defenses sheltering a community, as opposed to a settlement surrounding a fortified center, may reflect a preoccupation with defending the population, suggesting a somewhat more egalitarian society. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> It seems evident, therefore, that fortifications afforded a measure of social and even economic control. In fact, one of their most important aspects is their role as formalized filtering points between the city, its countryside, and any imported or exported goods. Gates in particular also functioned as toll points where authorities could tax those entering and exiting the city. They were, in a sense, checkpoints controlling movement of 25 G.

As the empire grew and commerce became more important, the design of gates also changed with distinct pedestrian and cart entrances designed to ease some of the congestion. These circumstances led to city gates becoming formal policing elements reflecting the authority of the state regulating the entrance into the city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">28</ref> Roman law highlights the importance of this function for the city gates. It defined the fortifications as res sanctae or holy things protected by the gods. Those who crossed or scaled the walls illegally committed a sacrilege against the gods punishable by death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">29</ref> To a certain extent this law prevented illegal smuggling activities, but it also connected to a very real religious association with fortifications. The religious factor on the Italian peninsula is one which stems from Etruscan urban foundation rituals, later adopted by the Romans, which defined the sacred boundary, or pomerium, of the city. As we shall see, its character, extent, and even existence for Pompeii is still unclear, due primarily to the relatively unknown character of the early city.</p><p>Although these elements influenced the development of fortifications, warfare and siege techniques remained the primary factors dictating their design. A number of ancient authors are the primary sources for the fundamentals of offensive and defensive siege tactics, and fortification design. Philon of Byzantium, Vitruvius, and Apollodorus Mechanicus are the chief sources concerning the architectural design of fortifications. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> Starting with Philon their collective writings span from the Hellenistic Age to the height of the Roman Empire with scholars equating Apollodorus Mechanicus to the illustrious architect Apollodorus of Damascus working under Trajan. Philon and Apollodorus in particular include extensive discussions on weaponry and siege tactics; whereas Vitruvius engages primarily in describing the construction of proper defenses. Aineias the Tactician, also known as Aineias Tacticus, is a more mysterious figure who remains unidentified beyond his name. His treatise on how to survive a siege relates to the practicalities and tactics that small cities needed to adopt to prepare for and endure through a long siege. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> Ancient accounts concerning the attack and defense of cities are also useful resources but are too numerous to mention here. They could be the object of their own separate book. Nevertheless, the contributions by Lawrence, and more recently Camporeale, offer significant starting points on the matter. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> The recognition that warfare and defense were crucial factors in the development of the community is a relatively recent approach; regional studies of defensive systems and fortifications remain underrepresented. This is particularly the case for the area of ancient Samnium, home of the Samnites, who are crucial to the development of Pompeii.   In fact, with the exception of S.P. Oakley's survey of hill-forts, few publications treat Samnite fortifications extensively. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> This focus on hill-forts is useful, and the result of the scattered nature of the Samnite occupation of the Apennine Mountains.

As a result, this study relies heavily on the better-published Roman, Etruscan, and Greek fortifications as a point of departure since the region of Campania was also a cross-road for all these cultures. Since there are few studies of the subject of fortifications on the Italian peninsula, the surveys on Greek fortifications published by F.E Winter and A.W. Lawrence are fundamental. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> Marion Blake and Giuseppe Lugli, writing in the 1940s and 1950s, were pioneers on the subject in Italy; their studies only included fortifications in wider surveys of Roman construction techniques. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> They primarily considered Roman fortifications and mentioned earlier Etruscan walls only when they formed a direct predecessor to later techniques.

In the late Republic magistrates across the Italian peninsula embarked on programs to construct or refurbish defenses to such an extent that the construction of walls was second only to the building of temples.</p><p>Two factors prompted this development: the general insecurity of the Republic, and an explicit process of acculturation between local and Roman elements. At the turn of the first century BCE Rome struggled against the Cimbri and Teutones in northern Italy. As Adrian Goldsworthy points out, this was a costly war. The conflict wiped out at least five consular armies, and induced the Romans to carry out the last known human sacrifice in their history, burying alive a Greek and a Gallic couple in the Forum Boarium. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> At the time the Romans perceived the threat that these tribes posed to be almost as serious as Hannibal's invasion of Italy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">45</ref> After the war the unrest continued almost unabated into the conflicts of the Social War and the dying Republic. This period of continued crisis likely stimulated the construction of fortifications in Italy.</p><p>Nevertheless, city walls were also elements of a distinct urbanization process and were part of the collection of public buildings that allowed a community to call itself a city.</p><p>Most recently, Jeffery Becker expanded this concept in a dissertation that defines the role of fortifications as part of essential civic architecture during Rome's expansion into central Italy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">46</ref> Perhaps Paul Zanker best described the role of city walls as part of the imposition of Roman elements.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 1 Prolegomena to the City Walls of Pompeii</head><p>The fortifications of Pompeii have played an important part in the modern scholarship on the urban definition of the city. Before diving into the complexities of how these fortifications functioned in antiquity we need to first define the major theories concerning their genesis and influence on the city's layout. Until recently, the excavations of Pompeii have focused on recovering the city as it was, frozen in 79 CE.</p><p>The city walls, however, due to their size, relative lack of ornament, and their instrumental role anchoring the street layout were one of the few monuments upon which excavations could shed light on the genesis of the city without disrupting the exposed ruins. Furthermore, the walls, and in particular gates such as the Porta Ercolano, have remained exposed ever since their first discovery in the late 1700's, influencing the views of countless visitors and scholars of antiquity. As a result, scholars have long contemplated the fortifications and they have produced many divergent theories concerning the development of Pompeii. Yet, despite the importance of Pompeii's fortifications, no general summary of their recovery exists and we know relatively little about their state of preservation after their first excavation. This chapter provides a background tracing the main excavations and problems concerning the walls; it also highlights the principal theories connecting the fortifications with the history of the city.</p><p>We will keep these theories in mind in subsequent chapters, but we should remember that without further evidence and excavations many of the hypotheses remain open to further debates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE CITY WALLS AND THE URBANIZATION OF POMPEII</head><p>Before examining the history of the excavations we need to define some of the most prominent hypotheses advanced over the decades concerning the development of Pompeii. The complexity of this debate is primarily the result of our lack of fundamental knowledge of the early city. In fact, with only two percent of Pompeii excavated below the level of 79 CE, the various theories remain highly speculative and susceptible to future changes. <ref type="bibr">48</ref> Many hypotheses rest on the dates and sequencing of the fortifications because it was the walls that anchored the major arteries of the city; they represent the first tangible signs of an organized community preoccupied with defense. The debate concerning the urban development essentially divides into two main camps; those favoring a grand central design of the city, and those who see it growing from an old core also known as the Altstadt.</p><p>The original nineteenth century hypothesis envisioned the city enclosed by the limestone fortification and founded in a single coherent urban design in the sixth century BCE. <ref type="bibr">49</ref> Also known as the grand Pompeii theory, the dynamics of such a massive single foundation were daunting and a few scholars hypothesized a slightly more nuanced development. Giuseppe Fiorelli and Antonio Sogliano speculated on the presence of a previous circuit suggesting that a fossa-agger system first defended the city. They envisioned a simple wooden palisade standing on an earthen embankment protected by a forward ditch which fully enclosed the plateau. Sogliano in particular also suggested that an early version of the Porta Ercolano opened on the western end of the via di Nola, basing his hypothesis on the logical observation that it lay directly opposite the Porta Nola in an orthogonal plan. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">50</ref> Maiuri discredited his theory, but Hans Eschebach recently claimed to have identified its remains beneath the House of Fabius Rufus (VII.16.22). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">51</ref> This scholarly debate, spanning many decades, exemplifies the complexity of the theories concerning the city walls and the urban development of the city. In fact, in light of the discovery of the pappamonte wall many decades later, Sogliano's conclusions were not that far from the mark.</p><p>In 1913 Haverfield proposed a new model suggesting that Pompeii first developed around a smaller core centered on the Forum and preserved in the irregular layout of the streets in the southwestern corner of the city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">52</ref> A few decades later, Armin von Gerkan elaborated the theory further. He identified the vicolo dei Soprastanti, the via degli Augustali, the vicolo del Lupanare, and the via dei Teatri as the limits of the Altstadt (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_42">6</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">53</ref> The circuit suggested by the streets, he argued, followed the path of a fortified agger. It included gates opening on important roads that became the major arteries of the city when it expanded into the confines of the orthostate wall. Eschebach later refined the theory by identifying two phases of development for the Altstadt. The first settlement developed as an urbs-quadrata, or squared city, centered on the later Forum, with four neighborhoods radiating out on each side. In a second phase this core gradually expanded into the limits Haverfield and Von Gerkan identified. Eschebach based his theory on Maiuri's discovery of a hypogeum beneath the Terme Stabiane. He argued that it was an Etruscan tomb which, given the traditions forbidding burials within the city limits, suggested that it was once outside the city walls. He also projected an earlier fortification defending the urbs-quadrata after excavations identified the remains of a robbed out wall in the vicolo del Lupanare. Eschebach argued for a third phase in which a planned vigorous expansion of urban development in the fifth century BCE led to the current layout of the city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">54</ref> Soon afterward British architectural historian John Ward-Perkins criticized the model, dismissing the urbs-quadrata and projecting a well ordered gradual expansion of Pompeii from the Altstadt nucleus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">55</ref> The Altstadt theory, in its various nuances, dominated the hypotheses concerning the development of early Pompeii until Stefano De Caro dated the pappamonte wall to the sixth century BCE. He essentially returned to the idea of a grand foundation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">56</ref> However, the new theory did not dispense with the Altstadt altogether. De Caro envisioned the fortification protecting a swath of wide open terrain surrounding a main habitation core. He admitted the uncertainty of assigning a separate chronology to the structures, and suggested the absence of an Altstadt fortification. Instead he envisioned a palisade, road, or drainage ditch to explain the preservation of the street layout. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">57</ref> Since then, recent archaeological excavations in Regio VI have refined the Altstadt theory suggesting that it actually represents a retreat of the urban expanse into smaller, more defensible, confines in the fifth century BCE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">58</ref> The city gradually expanded back out protected by a new wall after Campania entered the Roman sphere of influence in the late fourth century BCE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXCAVATING THE FORTIFICATIONS</head><p>The long debate surrounding the construction of the fortifications is primarily the result of their importance in the urban development of Pompeii. The history of their excavation is equally complex and accompanies the various theories visited above.</p><p>Unfortunately the first discovery of the walls is mired in the murky history of the early digs when recording techniques and requirements were far less accurate than standard modern ones. As a result, much of the earliest archaeological evidence is lost. Some of it survives in fragments throughout the published excavation journals known collectively as the Pompeianorum Antiquitatem Historia, or PAH, written between 1748 and 1861. <ref type="bibr">59</ref> Although somewhat incomplete, this document provides precious insight into the excavation of the city walls. Nevertheless, the light it sheds on the current state of the fortifications is somewhat dim. Since a synthesis of the progress of the excavations is lacking, the following section offers a first review of the evidence. It is important since we can catch a glimpse of the state of the fortifications at the moment of their recovery, and highlight the important decisions that led the remains we see today. What emerges is a continuous presence of the city walls throughout the history of Pompeian excavations that inevitably helped shape modern perceptions of the city and its limits. <ref type="bibr">59</ref> G. Fiorelli, Pompeianarum Antiquitatum Historia, (Naples 1862). The organization of the Pompeianorum Antiquarium Historia is somewhat cumbersome. Volume one and two each divide into three parts (1-3 and 4-6) with separate page numbers. Volume 3 is a single volume. Hence forth the notes will contain the volume, part, page and date. See also A. Laidlaw, "Mining the Early Published Sources: Problems and Pitfalls." In The World of Pompeii, edited by J.J. Dobbins and P. Foss (Hoboken, 2007), 620-621.</p><p>The excavations first touched the walls uncovering the Porta Ercolano on the northwestern tip of the city. The PAH entry of September 17, 1763 mentions excavation work occurring near the "...puerta de la cuidad" suggesting that workers had already noted its presence. <ref type="bibr">60</ref> By September 15, 1764, excavators had tunneled their way to the exterior of the gate and starting on October 14 they proceeded to uncover its full structure. They employed a systematic top-down approach in one of the first recorded instances of the application of the method widely used today. <ref type="bibr">61</ref> Unfortunately, as is the case for much of the journals, the entries concentrate on the finds recovered during the excavations rather than describing any architectural remains or embellishments on the walls. A series of entries dating to 1769 mention the recovery of statue parts in the vicinity of the gate including pairs of heads, arms, and hands with missing fingers. They are the only hints of any sort of statuary that may have adorned the Porta Ercolano. With the pieces and context now lost the fragments may have belonged to any number of nearby tombs or buildings. <ref type="bibr">62</ref> The records remain equally patchy for the next decades of excavation. Entries in 1766 and 1768 briefly report the discovery of the city walls near the soldier quarters, now known as the quadriporticus, in an effort to chart their course. <ref type="bibr">63</ref> Subsequent years saw 60 PAH 1 pars prima, 153. See also G. Fiorelli, Descrizione di Pompeii (Naples, 1875), 75. He gives the following dates for the full excavation of the gate: Sept. 14-Oct. 12, 1763, April 1-July 12, 1764, and June 29-Nov. 11, 1769. The actual entries in the PAH are somewhat different and less precise in locating the excavation often describing the works occurring in and around the gate. For example the entry for the start of the final excavation of the gate is actually July 22, 1769, PAH 1 Pars Prima, 234. 61 PAH 1 Addenda B, 114, #15 September 14, 1764, describes the adoption of a top down approach. To my knowledge this is the first systematic employment of this method. <ref type="bibr">62 PAH 1 Pars Prima, 233-236, July 29-Nov. 11, 1769</ref>. Both Adams and Clark describe the recovery of fragments of bronze drapery nearby. They believed it belonged to a tutelary deity of the city set on a pedestal next to the gate. Unfortunately no further information exists. The pedestal, however, is likely the unfinished tomb on the north side in front of the gate. See W. Adams, The Buried Cities of Campania  (London, 1873), 50; W.

The precise connotation of the works remains vague and the fortifications are only mentioned in passing as part of the uncovering of larger sections of the city. <ref type="bibr">64</ref> In 1782 explorations started on the southern end of Pompeii, but the location remains rather vague with the reports signaling excavators working to find the fortifications near the Temple of Isis. <ref type="bibr">65</ref> The city walls are actually quite far from the temple and the area uncovered was probably near the quadriporticus. Andrea De Jorio, author of one of the earliest guidebooks on Pompeii, more specifically mentions excavations occurring in the area that year. 66 He describes the recovered remains as razed by earthquakes and re-used for their material, suggesting that he may be referring to the large demolished section of wall curtain west of the Porta Stabia. Entries between March 15 and May 3, 1787 describe the continued excavation of a trench around the city. They probably refer to the area east of the Porta Ercolano where diggers began their efforts. <ref type="bibr">67</ref> After this episode the sources fall silent, but excavations seem to continue under General Championnet during the short-lived Parthenopean Republic of 1799. For reasons that remain unclear the general was particularly interested in finding the gates of the city.</p><p>By the end of the year excavators had found the top of the Porta Nola, and identified the remains of the Porta Sarno and Nocera. <ref type="bibr">68</ref> Up to this point the exposure of the walls was largely piecemeal. The policy changed radically when Queen Caroline Bonaparte (Murat) <ref type="bibr">64</ref> PAH 1 Pars Secunda, 14, Jan.2 -Jan. 9, 1783 describes work continuing on the city walls.

The four towers mentioned could be any of five, numbers VII-XII, now known in this area, and the gate in question most likely is the Porta Vesuvio. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">73</ref> Between September 6, 1811 and September 12, 1812 work continued on the excavation of the houses in Regio VI and included digging a narrow trench to reach the level of 79 CE on the field-side of the walls. <ref type="bibr">74</ref> On October 5, 1812 groups of soldiers started uncovering the walls on the east side of the city in three different unspecified locations. <ref type="bibr">75</ref> De Jorio reports on a concentrated effort near the amphitheater between May 1812 and June 1813. It exposed three towers and a gate, presumably the Porta Sarno and Towers V, VI, and VII. <ref type="bibr">76</ref> The PAH offers a slightly different version of the events and describes the diggers reaching the Porta Sarno on March 31, 1814 and exposing it by 5 May. <ref type="bibr">77</ref> Curiously, these entries omit the towers, detailing instead the discovery of posterns perhaps as a reference to their doors. To the north, the PAH first mentions the Porta Nola as new gate on May 8, 1813 despite the earlier identification of the gate under General Championnet. <ref type="bibr">78</ref> Work progressed rapidly and 5 June marks the recovery of the inscription and keystone of the arch. <ref type="bibr">79</ref> By 9 September, with much of the gate uncovered, the digging changed focus to follow the via di Nola into the city. <ref type="bibr">80</ref> Work near the amphitheater turned west after reaching Tower V and fully uncovered the Porta Nocera by February 1815.

Reports dating to roughly a month later confirm the full exposure of the Porta Nocera, noting that much of it lay ruined. <ref type="bibr">83</ref> Efforts subsequently moved back to the northern section of the fortifications to find the Porta Vesuvio. The degree of this campaign's success remains unclear, but excavations stopped on March 12, 1815 when worker gangs moved to uncover the amphitheater. <ref type="bibr">84</ref> Only the entries of January 16 and 23, 1819 mention a renewed effort to unite two wall sections uncovered in the northern section, but the precise location is unclear. <ref type="bibr">85</ref> By the time the digging officially ceased on April 30, 1815, the operation had uncovered two-thirds of the circuit, 86 including at least five city gates and an unspecified number of towers.

Roughly nine months later the work ended with a large part of the structure exposed to its current level. <ref type="bibr">90</ref> It subsequently gained most of its scholarly notoriety because of the debate on the translation of an Oscan inscription found in the gate court. The discussion need not concern us much. It centered mainly on reading the actual lettering present on the stone and its accurate translation (fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). <ref type="bibr">91</ref> The exterior edge of the gate remained unexcavated until 1853 when Giulio Minervini, seeking to publish a full plan, dug a tunnel to find the exterior corner of the eastern bastion. <ref type="bibr">92</ref> Only in the last decades of the 1800s did excavations resume to further expose the area in front of the gate. Across the city, the Porta Marina was the last unknown gate and Giuseppe Fiorelli began targeting the area on March 5, 1861. A previous campaign had detected it in 1844 as part of a project to provide a new entrance to the ruins, but had otherwise left <ref type="bibr">89</ref> There are many descriptions of rain water and particularly ice causing large sections of frescos and stucco to detach from buildings. For an example see Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi partie 1 (Paris, 1824), 44. <ref type="bibr">90</ref>  it buried. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">93</ref> A month after the operation began workers had fully defined the gate. The reports mostly describe the recovery of an outer niche holding the fragments of a statue of Minerva. No further information exists on the excavation work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">94</ref> Starting in February 1898 Antonio Sogliano resumed the excavations of the northern fortifications in an effort to fully expose Tower X. His aim was to better understand the construction sequence of the walls and tie it into the development of the city. Amongst his most important discoveries was a graffito mentioning Sulla scratched on the stucco of the first window on the right of the tower (fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Sogliano identified a victorious soldier as its maker who carved it, he believed, in honor of the Roman dictator.</p><p>Certainly no direct proof for this association exists, but Scholars have since used it to date the construction of the tower to before Sulla's siege and conquest of the city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">95</ref> The operation also cleared the curtain wall between Towers X and XI, and had finished exposing Tower XII by late August 1901. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">96</ref> In 1906 Sogliano returned to investigate the agger south and west of Tower XI, but he abandoned the excavations soon thereafter and never published the results of his work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">97</ref> In 1902 efforts also shifted to the nearby Porta Vesuvio since its full extent and plan remained unknown. Predictably, the recovery of the water castellum next to the gate generated the most interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">98</ref> Sogliano published a brief report on the gate in 1906 that included the only description of since disintegrated frescoes associated with two altars recovered on the forward bastion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">99</ref> Excavations continued intermittently in front of the gate until 1910 when Spano published and described the tombs currently visible in the area. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">100</ref> Following these sporadic and isolated campaigns, Amedeo Maiuri conducted the most systematic excavations to date between May 1926 and October 1927. He understood the unique importance of the fortifications and their capacity to shed light on the early history of Pompeii. The extensive publication of 1929 still remains a fundamental starting point for any serious investigations into the walls of Pompeii. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">101</ref> The campaign included trenches at the Porta Stabia, Nola, Vesuvio, Ercolano, and the systematic exploration of Tower XI. Maiuri's excavations revealed the orthostate wall and furnished detailed evidence on the walls and gates that allowed him to formulate the construction sequence largely still accepted today. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">102</ref> He subsequently made the recovery of the abandoned and reburied fortifications his personal quest. He extended his excavations of the Palestra in the 1930s to include the adjacent fortifications between Tower III and the amphitheater. Amongst the most important finds, although he never elaborated on the discovery, was the identification of the pappamonte fortification and the recognition that it predated the orthostate wall. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">103</ref> He next focused on re-excavating the walls between the Porta Vesuvio and Ercolano, publishing the results in 1943. Much of the original trench dug to find the walls had collapsed and, along with the debris from the excavations of the city, had re-buried most of the walls. <ref type="bibr">104</ref> These circumstances were true for much of the circuit. They explain the reliance of late-nineteenth-century Pompeianists, such as Johannes Overbeck and August Mau, on the drawings and reconstructions of the French architect François Mazois published several decades earlier. <ref type="bibr">105</ref> As detailed further in chapter four, this forced blind reliance led to a series of common misconceptions especially regarding the layout of towers and their decorations. Maiuri's investigations corrected these views and reached two important conclusions; a new, more elaborate reconstruction of the towers and the identification of two fills in front of the walls. They indicate interventions on the fortifications that occurred in the early Imperial and post-earthquake periods. <ref type="bibr">106</ref> By the 1950s Maiuri devised a systematic plan to free the city from the masses of excavation backfill by selling it for the construction of the new Napoli-Salerno highway and the leveling out of many nearby agricultural fields. The operation included uncovering most of the southern fortifications spanning the insula occidentalis and the Porta Sarno. This was no small feat, resulting in the removal of millions of tons earth.</p><p>From it emerged a better view of the Porta Marina and the southwestern quarter of the city; it also proved the existence of the Porta Nocera, which many scholars doubted (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">9</ref>). <ref type="bibr">107</ref> The scale of this operation hints at just how much the fortifications had disappeared since their initial excavation and with them the certainty of the existence of entire gates such as the Porta Nocera. Much of the walls exposed today are a result of this <ref type="bibr">104</ref> The extent of this reburial is evident in a quick comparison between illustrations in the publications of the early 1800s and photographs published at the turn of the century. In this period the section went from largely exposed to almost completely re-buried. In particular compare W. Gell and J. P.

The excavations of the 1800s had detected a structure, but, just as had been the case with the Porta Nocera, scholars remained divided on its nature and even its very existence. The importance of assessing the presence of the gate correlated to the orthogonal layout of the city and its urban development. For example Fiorelli, a firm believer in the existence of a Porta Capua, defined it as a counterpart to the Porta Nocera and projected a street axis between the two. Although subsequent excavations proved a different layout, the theory led Fiorelli to divide the city into the administrative regions, or regiones, still used today. <ref type="bibr">112</ref> The Japanese team conclusively uncovered the remains of Tower IX rather than a gate and gathered further important results (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_44">10</ref>). <ref type="bibr">113</ref> Chief amongst these was the conclusion that the building and the adjacent curtain were reconstructed in the early colony, thereby disputing the generally accepted notion that all the opus incertum sections dated to the pre-colonial period. <ref type="bibr">114</ref> Other results pointed to the unique nature of the area. The agger was prominently absent, making this the only tower with a back door opening directly onto the street. The team also recovered evidence of a possible culvert beneath the foundations and traces of a defensive ditch that once extended in front of the building.</p><p>Further results both confirmed and refuted parts of Maiuri's sequence. Deep excavations revealed traces of the pappamonte and orthostate walls, whereas the recovered materials confirmed an early third century BCE date for the limestone fortification. The absence of the agger, however, suggests that engineers re-used the inner face of orthostate wall as a terracing structure rather than replacing it with the elaborate internal wall built as part of the much later tufa reinforcement of the fortifications. <ref type="bibr">115</ref> These results significantly complicate Maiuri's strict phase separation according to construction techniques, and the notion of a uniform defensive line around the city. As we shall see, these issues have dominated and are still part of the scholarly debate, but only future systematic excavations can resolve them.</p><p>Another important conclusion similarly confounds our understanding of the condition of the walls at the time of the eruption. The careful investigations of the Japanese Institute of Paleological Studies recovered a medieval occupation layer inside the tower that indicated a contemporary spoliation of the adjacent masonry for building material. Crow-bar marks identified at the Porta Sarno signal that a similar process occurred elsewhere along the circuit, but its extent and date remains unquantifiable. 116 114 H. Etani, Pompeii: report of the excavation at Porta Capua, 1993-2005, 208. The excavation team is still unsure what kind of structure it actually is but describes it as a culvert. It does however, predate the first tower. 115 S. Sakai, "La storia sotto il suolo del 79 d.C. considerazioni sui dati provenienti dalle attività archeologiche svolte sulle fortificazioni di Pompei."

In some instances, such as the three towers on the north side of the city, a line of red bricks marks the distinction between modern and ancient masonry. In other occasions the masonry contains a plaque highlighting a restored section. One example in particular, still encased in the masonry, announces a repair to the curtain wall west of Tower X after a bomb demolished it during the allied air raid of 1943. No plaque, however, commemorates the reconstruction of the outer façade of Porta Marina obliterated during the same bombing. Here the restoration deliberately attempted to conceal any evidence of the event (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">11</ref>). <ref type="bibr">117</ref> We can only assume that the masonry is reconstructed accurately. Without markers it is generally up to the viewer to distinguish between modern and ancient masonry whether by visual analysis, the image archives, or both.</p><p>Returning to the excavation campaigns, a series of more targeted interventions have explored the fortifications in recent years. The PARPS project, run by The University of Cincinnati, has excavated at the Porta Stabia as part of a wider investigation into the nearby urban layout. Important conclusions include the identification of four distinct phases and the discovery of a buried altar beneath two superimposed niches cut into the eastern gate court wall. The altar and lower niche belong to the first two phases of the structure but their dates are inconclusive. Two later phases included the <ref type="bibr">117</ref> See García y García, Danni di guerra a Pompei, 167-171. construction of the opus incertum vault in the early colony and a final raising of the sidewalk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">118</ref> The late date of the vault in particular is important as it again counters the generally accepted view that these structures all represent pre-colonial construction events.</p><p>Two more targeted excavations investigated the Porta Vesuvio on the opposite end of the via Stabiana and the Temple of Venus near the Porta Marina. Results at the Porta Vesuvio confirmed Maiuri's sequence, including the succession of the limestone and tufa phases, dating them each to the early third and mid-second century BCE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">119</ref> The investigations also put to rest a longstanding debate conclusively proving that the inner opus incertum vault never existed for this gate. Unlike the other gates the Porta Vesuvio featured a vault on the exterior field side. Many scholars still date its construction to after the 62 CE earthquake, but the new results suggest its possible contemporaneity with the towers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">120</ref> The most recent investigation of the fortified perimeter occurred in the precinct of the Temple of Venus in the southwest corner of the city. Pappamonte blocks recovered in the area probably doubled as fortification and terracing structures that preceded similar structures in tufa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">121</ref> Although large parts of the fortifications were excavated and re-buried in sometimes unclear cycles, some of the gates have remained open to view ever since their first discovery. As a result they have played important roles in the accessibility to the site and modern perceptions of the ruins. The Porta Ercolano in particular formed the main access to the ruins for much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, greeting the distinguished members of the European elite and artists engaged in the grand tour. The importance of the gate in the vision of Pompeii and antiquity is considerable. Francesco Piranesi produced the first engravings of the area and the copies quickly spread throughout Europe, appearing in many descriptions and prints of the period. <ref type="bibr">122</ref> Early guide books and scholarly accounts almost invariably contain descriptions and illustrations of the fortifications. They often form the only evidence on the actual state of the walls, providing precious insight into any embellishments that have disappeared and the slow deterioration of the fortifications. <ref type="bibr">123</ref> The majority of these descriptions focus on the Porta Ercolano and the northern tract of the fortifications, whereas the Porta Nola, located further off the beaten track, received somewhat less attention. Other gates have played similar roles. As the excavations progressed, the fortifications slowly became psychological and physical barriers defining the city limit just as Caroline Bonaparte had intended. Today the walls continue to form a backdrop for visitors and, perhaps most importantly, they still help shape the concept of the limit of Pompeii as defined by the line of its defenses.</p></div>

All the rest is window-dressing."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-John McK. Camp II</head><p>As mentioned above, scholars tend to distinguish an early Pompeii spanning the Archaic and Early Classical periods. This period of urban genesis was critical to the creation of a strong local communal identity that translated into the stability of a longterm settlement capable of surviving up to the eruption of 79 CE. Since much of this early city is unknown, the nature of the evidence forces a primarily archaeological approach to define how the fortifications interacted with the settlement to create a unified appearance. This approach forms an undercurrent in later chapters where other types of evidence, such as social structure and artistic production, will help reframe our discussion on the role of the fortifications. Throughout the various periods, however, it is important to remember that all these factors continuously played important roles in the definition of the city and its identity.</p><p>Recent archaeological discoveries have shed more light on the oldest and most enigmatic period of Pompeian history. Sporadic finds confirm a Neolithic presence on the plateau and a late Bronze/early Iron Age Palma Campania settlement in the area of the future Regio V and the Porta Nocera. <ref type="bibr">125</ref> Although future discoveries may change this picture, the choice of location is hardly coincidental. The area associated with Regio V is also the highest part of the Pompeian plateau and is particularly strategic. From here the settlement commanded the long natural valley forming an early coastal communication route through the region. It later accommodated the main decumanus of the city, known today as the via Stabiana. <ref type="bibr">126</ref> This phase seems to flicker out fairly quickly and a habitation hiatus follows lasting to the final decades of the seventh century BCE. <ref type="bibr">127</ref> The area of the Sarno Valley then experiences a shift in the occupation pattern where a number of smaller hamlets unite into larger settlements in a synoecistic movement creating new urban conglomerates. This development coincides with expanding trade routes to the east and the influence of the Etruscans spreading into Campania from the north. <ref type="bibr">128</ref> Evidence suggests that the settlers chose the area of the Altstadt, roughly coinciding with a small lava spur, for its naturally fortified southern, eastern, and western approaches. Excavations conducted in the area of the Triangular Forum uncovered evidence for buildings already occupying the area in the mid-seventh century BCE.</p><p>Many remains are mostly simple postholes probably related to huts, whereas other more substantial foundations feature regularly spaced pappamonte blocks.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">foot_12</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BUILDING A COMMUNITY: THE PAPPAMONTE FORTIFICATION AND THE CITY</head><p>The success of the city depended primarily on its conformance to the rules governing the choice of its location. Ideal sites required a healthy environment to sustain the population and ample arable land to retain a degree of self-sufficiency. <ref type="bibr">130</ref> A site also needed to lend itself to easy defense and provide refuge for the population in times of danger, whether natural or man-made. Ideally, approaches to the settlement should pass over somewhat difficult terrain to create strategic bottlenecks where small defensive units could fend off larger attacking forces. As a prerequisite to basic survival, the site needed a reliable source of water, preferably in form of natural springs, nearby rivers, or manmade collection cisterns and wells reaching aquifers deep in the ground. It also needed to be centrally located in relation to its territory. This way it could function as a strategic base to exercise rapid intervention over subjects and intruders, and provide a convenient commercial exchange centre. <ref type="bibr">131</ref> In many ways, early Pompeii fulfilled these prerequisites, guaranteeing the success of the initial settlement.</p><p>During the sixth century BCE a new fortification enclosed an area that would define Pompeii for centuries to come. Its route ran along a natural ridge created by the edge of an ancient lava flow coming down form Vesuvius to the north (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_46">12</ref>). The extended ridge gave the settlement strong natural defenses on the south, west, and eastern sides. Only the northern approach, a gentle slope from the mountain, formed a weak spot.</p><p>The enceinte encompassed the same topographic depression, dominated by the previous Palma Campania Settlement, linking the territory north of Vesuvius with the Sorrentine peninsula and the city of Nola. <ref type="bibr">132</ref> At the foot of the plateau the River Sarno flowed into the sea, further enhancing the strategic position of Pompeii as the harbor for the cities of Nocera and Nola further inland. <ref type="bibr">133</ref> Perched on top of the plateau, the new city dominated its immediate territory as a crucial fortified node. Its extensive views helped it control both land and sea-commerce, and provided early warning against territorial intruders and a place of refuge for the population of the countryside in times of danger. <ref type="bibr">134</ref> The visible remains of the pappamonte fortification are scant with one or two courses of highly weathered blocks, some 40-50 cm high and 75-100 cm long, surviving between the Porta Nocera and Tower III. <ref type="bibr">135</ref> They were likely exposed by the natural erosion that occurred in the area in antiquity. The shallow foundations and friable nature of the rock suggest that the wall could not have exceeded more than five or six courses in height. Excavations have recovered large sections of the wall in house I.5.4-5 near Porta Stabia, buried in the agger of Porta Nocera, Tower IX, the stretch between the Porta Vesuvio and Porta Ercolano, and the terrace of the Temple to Venus Pompeiana. <ref type="bibr">136</ref> De Caro argues that a strong terra battuta, or beaten earth, level recovered near the Porta Ercolano and the Porta Nocera suggests the presence of a small pomerial street running behind the wall facilitating communication along the perimeter of the city. <ref type="bibr">137</ref> In some areas the wall, if it did extend around the whole city, is still uncharted. Remains are notably missing near the Porta Nola, suggesting that the circuit ran slightly further west than the current fortifications (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_47">13</ref>). <ref type="bibr">138</ref> Similarly, the enceinte is unaccounted for in the area near the great theater. Guzzo suggests that the building, cut in typically Greek fashion into the natural rock, probably obliterated the remains, but the fortifications most likely ran along a portion of the ridge. <ref type="bibr">139</ref> As mentioned previously, it was not until De Caro's excavations in the 1980s that modern scholars recognized the importance of the pappamonte wall. Yet it was Maiuri's excavations that provided much of the early information concerning its course and layout.</p><p>In particular, his discoveries point to a strong continuity in the location of the gates, and therefore, the urban layout of the city. Maiuri described the remains of two early gates; one at the Porta Vesuvio and another sealed beneath Tower XI. This layout suggests that the via di Mercurio once functioned as a main artery of the city and is now a fossil in the urban framework. <ref type="bibr">140</ref> The excavations of Tower IX confirmed Stefano De Caro's theory for an all-encompassing enceinte when they uncovered another long section of the fortifications. <ref type="bibr">141</ref> The remains were again minimal composed mostly of one or two courses on shallow foundations. <ref type="bibr">142</ref> The latest excavations at the Porta Vesuvio confirmed the small tracts of the enceinte that Maiuri recovered on the north side of the city (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">14</ref>).</p><p>The work also discovered further substantial remains of the early gate including a possible small forward bastion that served as a clear predecessor to the current plan of Porta Vesuvio. <ref type="bibr">143</ref> Theories on the original appearance of the fortifications abound and are still debated. They range from projecting a single freestanding wall, to a low fortification with <ref type="bibr">139</ref> Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 106-107. <ref type="bibr">140</ref> Maiuri, "Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,"168. <ref type="bibr">141</ref> It is in fact de Caro who first recognized the scant remains Maiuri uncovered at Tower IX and Porta Vesuvio as part of the pappamonte wall.

This assessment seems rather narrow in its focus, and it is more likely that the defenses included both symbolic and military components. In fact, any of these structures could easily respond to the predominantly raiding type of warfare at the time, which precluded the need for elaborate defenses. Furthermore, the recovery of a road hugging the city side of the defenses suggests a concern to maintain an easy access route to rapidly meet any threats. <ref type="bibr">145</ref> In this framework, although unimpressive in height, its addition to Pompeii's impressive natural defenses actually created a formidable defensive line in tune with the military threats of period (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_49">15</ref>).</p><p>The fortifications therefore responded to both symbolic and defensive needs to define the community. A further indicator of these factors is that the enceinte did not feature a uniform appearance around the city. Instead it probably responded to variations in the natural strength of the terrain. Furthermore, as is well attested in Greece, areas with increased visibility perhaps displayed more impressive fortifications designed to flaunt the city's wealth and status. 146 Fabrizio Pesando points out the discovery of a large stepped pappamonte wall just north of the Porta Marina near the House of Umbricus Scaurus (VII.16.15). It signals a large building or perhaps even a terracing structure at the city limits. <ref type="bibr">147</ref> Similarly Emanuele Curti, after excavating the precinct of the Temple of Venus Pompeiana, suggests that the pappamonte enceinte probably functioned primarily as a terracing structure on its southern side. Presumably the slope of the ridge was once gentler, and a terracing wall helped flatten out the area for the buildings above. <ref type="bibr">148</ref> It is here that we can further appreciate the symbolic value of the defenses. Such a terracing wall, placed high on the lava ridge, made for an impressive sight for anyone approaching the city from the south. As a defensive structure it not only claimed the plateau itself. It also symbolized an assertion of power over a wide swath of territory and the region rather than responding solely to military concerns.</p><p>A similar concept resides in the materials used for its construction. Building techniques could implicitly tie a community to its territory. Technological innovations and the availability of local materials were influential factors affecting the manner of defense. The presence of large forests, for example, might encourage the extensive use of wood in fortifications, whereas an abundance of sedimentary soils could stimulate the use of mudbrick. The development of better tools and building techniques had a significant effect on the construction of stone enceintes as masons progressively acquired skills facilitating quarrying and stone dressing. <ref type="bibr">149</ref> For example, in Etruria the relatively soft volcanic tufa encouraged the use of ashlar masonry in the south, whereas the harder and irregular lime-and sandstones of the northern regions stimulated the use of polygonal techniques at sites such as Roselle, Cosa, and Populonia. <ref type="bibr">150</ref> Vitruvius, writing many centuries later, recommends the use of local materials for the construction of walls, and that engineers build them in such a fashion to last as long as possible. <ref type="bibr">151</ref> Well-built walls, therefore, also reflected the skills and technological achievement of local craftsmen and communities.</p><p>We catch a glimpse of the wall construction process and its effect on the community in an account by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus concerning the fortifications of Syracuse. The walls of the Greek city are celebrated for their massive length and scale, but their appearance need not concern us here. More important is the episode of roughly 400 BCE when Dionysius I, the tyrant of the city, expanded the enceinte to include the strategic Epiploae plateau in anticipation of a war with Carthage he intended to begin. He mustered over sixty thousand free peasants and six thousand yokes of oxen from the surrounding countryside to build a section of wall some thirty stades in length. With one stade roughly measured at 180 meters, the total length of the wall built was about 5.4 km. Dionysius put a master-builder in charge of each stade and assigned six parties, each 200 men strong, to individually build a plethron length of wall, or roughly 30 meters, under the supervision of a mason. The remaining work force quarried and transported the stone. Dionysius incited the men with rewards and led by example, supervising and participating in the construction process. He inspired such zeal and competition in the builders that crews finished the entire fortification, including the towers and six gates, in just twenty days. 152 criticized such a linear approach.

In addition, the numbers Diodorus furnishes are unreliable and probably exaggerated since he wrote about the event roughly 350 years after it happened. Nevertheless, the episode tells us something about the labor organization on such massive projects and the division of its construction into distinct sections. It is also a vivid example of how the building process and its spectacle could foster a sense of community and legitimize the power of the commissioner. In fact, the historian describes how onlookers watched in wonder at the zeal and labor of so many people on a single project.</p><p>The use of pappamonte in Pompeii suggests a similar localized construction process. A recent lithological examination of the material identified it as a soft sedimentary conglomerate of volcanic debris, or tufa, found almost exclusively in the area of the lower Sarno River. <ref type="bibr">153</ref> The type is soft and easy to quarry, but its friable nature precludes any sort of tall or strong wall construction suitable to later defensive developments. With most of the material quarried on site it directly tied the community with its territory. Aside from envisioning chief masons supervising small groups of workers assigned to individual sections, it is hard to assess who exactly built the wall. <ref type="bibr">154</ref> For example, we know that Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, actively employed poor citizens on public projects in order to keep them distracted from the affairs of state and prevent uprisings. <ref type="bibr">155</ref> This factor, however, remains unclear for Pompeii, but if the builders were citizens, such as was the case with the Syracusan fortifications, then their association with the community probably enhanced the symbolic value to the fortifications. In any event, given the scale of the construction process, it is clear that the localized effort likely fostered a strong sense of community and identification for the population who depended on the region's resources for survival.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibrating the Image of the City</head><p>The materials and construction techniques composing the fortifications also feature in the public and private buildings of the settlement, thereby influencing the appearance of the city and its image. Along with the city walls, it is the sanctuaries that form the most tangible structures of early Pompeii. They are similarly remarkable for their continuity and longevity throughout much of its history. The Temple of Apollo is a case in point. An opus quadratum pappamonte temenos wall, now buried beneath the House of Tryptolemus (VII.7.5), attests that the area already functioned as a sacred space in the early years of the sixth century BCE. The temenos wall probably defined an open interior space including a single votive column and an altar dedicated to rituals. By the close of the century the area also featured an Italic-style temple with a high podium composed of pappamonte blocks and a superstructure built in perishable materials. <ref type="bibr">156</ref> The recovered terracotta acroteria are stylistically similar to others found in the area of southern Latium and Campania. They suggest that the temple carried a distinct Campanian type roof blending local and Etrusco-Italic elements mirroring the wider regional developments of the time. <ref type="bibr">157</ref> Pompeii preserves the remains of other sanctuaries dating to this period, but their character is less clear. The survival of a tufa column, immured unmoved into a later wall of the House of the Etruscan Column (VI.5.17), and the excavated remains of a possible associated altar indicate the presence of a sanctuary. This setup is conceptually similar to the earliest Temple of Apollo, and excavation results suggest that the two were contemporaneous. The area associated with the House of the Etruscan Column perhaps functioned as an open sacred grove dedicated to Jupiter inside the perimeter of the settlement, but the exact characteristics are elusive. <ref type="bibr">158</ref> Nearby, a Doric limestone column later incorporated into a wall near the intersection of the via di Nola and the via Stabiana probably denotes the remains of a similar sanctuary. This votive column is even more enigmatic, but its purposeful preservation suggests its continuing importance throughout the remainder of the history of the city. <ref type="bibr">159</ref> The southern edge of the Pompeian plateau preserves two of the most important sanctuaries of the city. The same excavations that recovered evidence of the early enceinte on the terrace of the Temple of Venus also uncovered pappamonte foundation walls belonging to earlier structures. Traces of large deposits of mudbrick recovered nearby are probably the remains of collapsed wall superstructures. <ref type="bibr">160</ref> These remains suggest that the area was an early sanctuary perhaps dedicated to the Samnite goddess Mefitis Fisica who is attested at the site in the second century BCE. As we shall see, the Romans transformed her cult into that of Venus Pompeiana in reference to her role as personal protectress of the Roman dictator Sulla, who conquered the city. <ref type="bibr">161</ref> The makeup of the early building and the sanctuary are elusive and will need further investigation.</p><p>However, the foundation walls and the use of perishable materials suggest a design similar to that of the Temple of Apollo.</p><p>Further east the temple dedicated to Athena/Hercules, built on the very edge of the Triangular Forum, was perhaps the most imposing landmark of early Pompeii. Mostly built using perishable materials, it included Doric capitals fashioned in local Sarno limestone and terracotta acroteria on the roof. Dating to c. 530 BCE, this building replaced an earlier wooden version built at the beginning of the century. <ref type="bibr">162</ref> Through a characteristic mixture of Greek and Italic architectural elements, the new temple displayed affinities with Temple B at Pyrgi and the Temple of Apollo Lycaeus at Metapontum. It received at least two refurbishments between the sixth century and the early decades of the fifth century BCE, suggesting its importance for the population of the city. <ref type="bibr">163</ref> Like the Temple of Mefitis, its location on the very tip of the high southern lava ridge was a defining element of Pompeii and it acted as a beacon for those approaching from the Monti Lattari and the sea. <ref type="bibr">164</ref> New excavations throughout the city have recovered many other pappamonte blocks lined up as foundations for buildings above. Investigations in the House of Marcus Lucretius (IX, 3, 5.24) and the House of the Gladiators (V.5.3) produced some significant 161 I shall discuss her further in chapter 5. F.

The most elusive are the shallow walls of roughly shaped, chipped or broken lava and limestone blocks that probably functioned as foundations for mudbrick walls. <ref type="bibr">168</ref> The second type features more regularly hewn rectangular pappamonte blocks that subdivide further into two distinct types. The first employs blocks laid down as headers with their long sides next to each other. The second uses the blocks as stretchers arranged longitudinally with meeting short sides. The first header type, recovered beneath Tower X, the Temple of Venus, and the Basilica, perhaps functioned as heavy terracing structures. The stretcher type perhaps supported freestanding walls or belonged to terracing structures in particularly flat areas, such as the vicinity of the Porta Nocera, <ref type="bibr">165</ref> The occupation levels related to these structures date to the sixth century BCE.

The appearance of such a plethora of archaic remains has led to a re-evaluation of De Caro's hypothesis concerning the wide empty spaces at Pompeii. This new theory, proposed after extensive excavations in Regio VI, sees a well-developed urbanized town in the sixth century BCE with a street pattern foreshadowing the later Hellenistic layout of the city. <ref type="bibr">170</ref> The very nature of these fragmentary remains calls into question the reliability of assigning all the recovered tracts along the perimeter of Pompeii to an actual continuous defensive structure. In fact, they may relate to individual buildings, or localized terracing structures. One thing to keep in mind for the period is that the unsophisticated tactics of siege warfare and the strength of strongholds usually led armies to avoid direct attacks on cities. When they did occur, sieges featured the widespread use of manual weapons; the basic armoury included spears, slingshots, and bows in both offensive and defensive operations. <ref type="bibr">171</ref> Settlements often depended on their nativa praesidia, or natural topographical contours, easily reinforced with local relatively simple defensive structures. <ref type="bibr">172</ref> Only the richest cities could afford full stone enceintes encompassing the entire settlement.

In fact, we know very little about the land use and the extent of the city's urbanization. Only further investigations into the nature of this early settlement can hope to further clarify the picture.</p><p>In any event, the recovered remains of the pappamonte enceinte seem to follow a relatively consistent course around the city. They suggest a well-organized and relatively powerful settlement capable of mustering the resources to build it. Nevertheless, the overall picture is still very fragmented. Where Coarelli likes to see well-urbanized settlement, De Caro envisions a wide-open terrain with occasional buildings between the Altstadt and the outer fortification. <ref type="bibr">175</ref> Perhaps the real picture lies somewhere between the two. Paolo Carafa points out that many other excavations into the earliest strata of Pompeii have failed to reveal any traces of earlier structures, suggesting the open landscape advocated by De Caro. <ref type="bibr">176</ref> Pesando perhaps best describes it as an occupation "…a macchia di leopardo", or leopard spots, where the inequities of the terrain resulting from the lava flows composing the Pompeian plateau dictated the siting of private <ref type="bibr">173</ref> Lugli, La tecnica edilizia romana, 65.

Nevertheless, many of the main arteries accessing the city and large parts of the street network within the walls seem, by and large, already laid out. On the Italian peninsula the contemporary Etruscan settlements of Veii and Tarquinia supply a similar picture for a large but dispersed settlement within a wide enceinte, suggesting that this type of occupation was common in the period. <ref type="bibr">178</ref> All we can really say about this phase for Pompeii is that a consistent construction technique employed throughout the settlement directly or indirectly helped create a more unified appearance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE ORTHOSTATE WALL</head><p>In the late fifth century BCE Pompeii built a new wall replacing the old pappamonte fortifications. <ref type="bibr">179</ref> Scholars tend to identify its construction as the result of the Samnite conquest of Pompeii, or as a reaction to their rising threat from the hinterland.</p><p>Archaeological evidence suggests that it closely followed the course of its earlier counterpart along the tactical ridge naturally defending the city. Maiuri uncovered substantial remains of the wall near the Porta Vesuvio, the Porta Ercolano, the Porta Stabia, and a long section between Towers III and IV (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_50">16</ref>). <ref type="bibr">180</ref> The recent excavations near Tower IX also recovered a section of the wall where it perhaps later changed function to a retaining wall for the subsequent Samnite fortifications. <ref type="bibr">181</ref> The new enceinte respected the previous gate openings, but their original appearance remains uncertain. In fact, not much of the wall remains. Maiuri postulates that the later Samnite fortifications largely demolished it and the blocks were re-used in various construction projects around the city. <ref type="bibr">182</ref> Like its predecessor, the orthostate wall is absent from the area of the Porta di Nola, and no trace has yet surfaced between the Porta Ercolano and the Triangular Forum.</p><p>Two opposing walls, built using large slabs of a local yellow travertine known as Sarno limestone, composed the outer and inner façade of the fortification. An earth fill occupied the space between the two walls in a typically Greek military construction technique known as emplecton. <ref type="bibr">183</ref> The two faces stood on average some 4.30 meters apart. They rested on an almost negligible initial foundation course composed of horizontal slabs that supported a squat wall reaching only 6-7 meters high including the parapet. <ref type="bibr">184</ref> The retaining walls featured courses of flat stone slabs set vertically as orthostates. At approximately every third slab, builders inserted a header into the earth fill to stabilize the wall. Horizontal courses laid flat into the fill acted in a similar reinforcing role. The wall almost achieved a regular isodomic structure in a very elegant yet slightly irregular construction pattern of blocks quarried in varying sizes. Only Fritz Krischen, writing in 1941, attempted to reconstruct this phase based on Maiuri's data. His reconstruction shows a squat wall with merlons and the emplecton technique providing a wall-walk (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">17</ref>). Access stairs recovered near the gates were mostly narrow and steep ending against the parapet. This was a clear practical solution since the width of the wall did not allow for more than ten steps. A wider merlon was featured at the top of the steps to protect the soldiers heading up to the battlements. <ref type="bibr">185</ref> On the city side, a road known as a pomerial street closely shadowed the fortifications. It allowed for an easy communication route around the city. <ref type="bibr">186</ref> A ditch, or fossa, perhaps ran in front of the wall to increase its height.</p><p>The emplecton construction technique led to a free-standing fortification that, along with the bright yellow Limestone employed, is a clear and abrupt departure from the earlier agger-like structure and dark grey coloring of the pappamonte wall. This shift is difficult to explain. As opposed to the pappamonte material quarried nearby the city, the limestone quarries were probably located relatively far away in the higher reaches of the Sarno valley. From there the material likely arrived at Pompeii by means of river barges transporting it downstream. <ref type="bibr">187</ref> This factor implies further aspects concerning Pompeii's territorial reach including its possible control and hegemony over the valley, or its close interaction with neighboring populations, or both. The extent and character of these relationships, however, remain difficult to quantify without further evidence, and a precise location for the quarries. Nevertheless, the organizational skill and technical expertise required to build the orthostate wall suggests a Hellenic influence. In fact, scholars view the emplecton construction technique as a typically Hellenic design, inducing some to identify this as a Greek period for <ref type="bibr">Pompeii. 188</ref> This may suggest a strong bond between Pompeii and the neighboring Greek settlement of Neapolis.</p><p>Although this theory remains hard to prove, the fortification represents a proud achievement prominently displayed around the city.</p><p>Despite the considerable investment required in their construction, the new defenses herald a period of occupational hiatus, and possibly implosion, for Pompeii. The chronic lack of archaeological data leaves us in the dark about the city's character and appearance at this stage, but the start of the hiatus roughly coincides with the defeat of Etruscan forces by the Syracusan navy at the battle of Cuma in 474 BCE. <ref type="bibr">189</ref> With Etruscan influence waning Greek cities, such as Neapolis, Capua, and Cuma gained new prominence in the region. Soon afterwards a new Samnite threat materialized from the interior. The Samnites proved unstoppable, capturing Capua in 423 and Cuma in 421 BCE; this left only Neapolis as the sole, somewhat independent, Greek settlement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">190</ref> The new status quo eventually created an Osco-Campanian society from the resultant interaction between the Samnites and the coastal population, but at Pompeii it led to large areas of the city languishing in abandonment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">191</ref> Excavations have identified a uniform abandonment stratum covering many pappamonte period buildings. It is particularly evident between the second half of the fifth and the first half of the fourth centuries BCE when important sanctuaries such as the Temple of Apollo also display an abrupt halt in votive materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">192</ref> The reasons for its formation remain unclear. Fabrizio Pesando suggests that natural disasters, including flooding and mudflows, deposited the layer resulting in the subsequent abandonment of large areas of the city. Yet, the street layout probably remained much the same, suggesting some sort of urban cohesion. Such disparate results have led to a new theory hypothesizing a gradual retreat of the urban extent of Pompeii into the area of the Altstadt. <ref type="bibr">193</ref> The rate of this retreat is currently impossible to assess, but many of the previous pappamonte structures, including the Sanctuaries of Apollo and Mefitis, were probably standing when the orthostate wall was built. As opposed to the pappamonte fortification, the use of Sarno limestone and the new construction technique, at least initially, projected a distinct architectural contrast on the city, offering a renewed sense of security to its inhabitants and satellite communities. The messages it carried clearly distinguished the old pappamonte wall from the new fortifications and the patrons of their respective construction events. The fortifications may therefore also relate to a shift in the socio-political make-up or conquest of the city by a dominant group of outsiders intent on making a mark.</p><p>Until recently the composition of the new Altstadt defenses remained unclear, with scholars hypothesizing an agger system protecting the nucleus. The evidence remains scant, but geophysical investigations at the House of the Postumii (VIII 4,4.49)   suggest that an oblique gate, also known as a Scaean type, opened on the early via dell' Abbondanza (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_52">18</ref>). The discovery of wall remains built using both pappamonte and limestone blocks, and a possible external ditch suggest the presence of an agger-fossa system in the area. <ref type="bibr">194</ref> The recovered materials point to the sixth and fifth centuries BCE as a construction date, making it roughly contemporaneous to both the pappamonte and orthostate walls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">195</ref> Similar foundation blocks uncovered beneath the House of Mercury (VII.2.35) suggest the presence of an analogous fortification on the northern perimeter of the Altstadt. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">196</ref> A series of possibilities emerge regarding the relationship of this wall with the other outer enceintes. It may represent a secondary, inner, defensive line to either the pappamonte or orthostate walls, or both. Perhaps the Altstadt functioned primarily as a citadel or urban conglomerate, while the rest of the plateau remained open as a pasture and farm land. This image is actually more consistent with similar large settlements in Etruria and southern Italy. Cities such as Atri, Volterra, and Veii, to name a few, often divided up into a sacred fortified core, or arx, and an outer defensive perimeter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">197</ref> Other possibilities are that it served as an interim defensive system between the two outer defensive lines, or that it represents a defensive line built after a sudden contraction of the city. A period of significant urban regression inserts Pompeii into the wider trend of urban depopulation occurring in south-central Italy in the fifth century BCE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">198</ref> Although the information is patchy, Pompeii would continue to exist within the Altstadt until the construction of the following limestone enceinte in the late fourth century BCE.</p><p>Interestingly excavations under the Eumachia building in the Forum have recovered foundations built using both pappamonte and limestone blocks belonging to a row of shops dating to the middle of the fourth century BCE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">199</ref> The construction technique is similar to the Altstadt walls uncovered nearby and, as is the case with the pappamonte fortifications, its uniform application suggests a consistent image for the city.</p><p>Significant questions remain as to who exactly founded and inhabited early Pompeii. Historically Strabo identifies the peoples successively occupying the city as the Oscans, Thyrrenians (Etruscans), Pelasgians, Samnites, and finally the Romans. <ref type="bibr">200</ref> Yet, a direct archaeological reference to these periods is hard to pinpoint outside of the heavy Etruscanizing elements in some of the civic buildings. <ref type="bibr">201</ref> Many believe that the Italicstyle of the Temple of Apollo and the recovery of bucchero pottery associated with the sanctuary suggest a strong Etruscan component to the city. As a result, some have defined earliest Pompeii as a coastal emporium to the inland cities of Nola and Nocera, resembling similar Etruscan settlements such as Gravisca and Pyrgi. <ref type="bibr">202</ref> Similarly, the position of Pompeii on an extensive plateau near the sea resembles the location of Etruscan cities such as Veii and Cerveteri and has led scholars to identify an Etruscan foundation of the city. <ref type="bibr">203</ref> Nevertheless, the nearby Greek settlements of Neapolis, Cuma, and Paestum must have presented a distinct Greek cultural influence. This factor -on the most basic level-is evident in the Doric elements of the temple in the Triangular Forum at <ref type="bibr">Pompeii. 204</ref> Similarly, scholars have used the nature of the defenses and the character of the temples to ascribe a typical Greek or Etruscan aspect to the city. Maiuri, a particularly <ref type="bibr">200</ref> Strabo Geography V, 4,8. <ref type="bibr">201</ref> For a summary of some of the pressing problems concerning the composition of the population of early Pompeii see E.

The later Samnite agger system instead reflects an Italic defense tradition. <ref type="bibr">205</ref> Such an approach is rather simplistic, as the mechanisms of transmission related to military architecture are difficult to pinpoint. In fact, research suggests a distinct Syracusan, and hence Greek, influence in the agger design of the Servian Walls built in Rome in the fourth century BCE-we will return to these issues below. <ref type="bibr">206</ref> Certainly the new construction technique and materials of the orthostate wall contrast dramatically with its pappamonte predecessor. Yet, if this means that we are dealing with an entirely new influence on the city or just an adoption of differing military tactics remains hard to tell. Certainly, a region like ancient Campania with Etruscan, Greek, and Oscan influences remains difficult to characterize. As Thiermann points out, however, Pompeii probably adopted a very own identity as a mixture of those two cultures, or perhaps, even more so, with the addition of the Samnite element playing a distinctive role in the area.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_54">foot_54</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WALLS, GODS, AND THE LEGITIMIZATION OF POWER</head><p>Perhaps the nature of Campanian society can help explain the character of the two early enceintes, since political and social developments influenced settlement organization and systems of defense. <ref type="bibr">208</ref> Aristotle mentions that a single citadel was characteristic of tyrannical or monarchical and oligarchic models of government where the fortified area enabled the control of the population. A city located in a plain was characteristic to a democracy offering much more freedom for commerce and mobility for its citizens. A ruling aristocracy would have a number of strongholds dotting the landscape where each aristocrat or group of families controlled their dependents through private fortified enclosures. <ref type="bibr">209</ref> Recent analyses of defensive networks and strategies reach similar conclusions where socio-political motivations and tensions were clear factors in the manner of defense. For example, fortifications built in late Bronze Age Greece were mainly concerned with the private interests of select elites. Villages, presumably occupied by clients, surrounded fortified centers protecting the population from outside threats and the elite from social upheavals. This setup differs from fortifications built in early Greek colonial foundations where they protected the entire community as a reflection of the evening out of social classes. <ref type="bibr">210</ref> Changing politics and the appearance of new social ladders led to similar developments on the Greek mainland. The rise of the Athenian democracy shifted defensive concerns from a territorial network of strongholds reflecting the land possessions of the hoplite class, to the construction of the long walls protecting a more egalitarian society resulting from the new defensive emphasis on its navy. <ref type="bibr">211</ref> The acropolis therefore quickly lost its importance and was in some cases dispensed with altogether. <ref type="bibr">212</ref> At Pompeii the fortifications seem to reflect an oligarchic model of government.</p><p>By the sixth century BCE the Sarno Valley experienced the culmination of an <ref type="bibr">209</ref> Aristotle Politics 7,1330A.35ff. <ref type="bibr">210</ref> Winter, Greek Fortifications, 33 and 57 'The history of the sixth century affords many instances of tyrants seizing the citadel as the first step toward control of the city' and further down the page 'The success of a coup d'état could best be assured by occupying the acropolis as a preliminary move.' 211 What Cherici refers to as a transition from a hoplite democracy to a nautical democracy based on the rise of a tradesmen and artisans.

The system rejected private ostentatious display, and the elite instead built monuments and offered votive displays in sanctuaries to express their wealth. <ref type="bibr">213</ref> In this framework it is hardly surprising that Pompeii saw the construction of fortifications and sanctuaries dominating the landscape, since they clearly legitimized elite rule and control of the territory. A similar trend occurred in southern Etruria where large settlements occupied high expansive plateaus defended by high natural cliffs and rivers flanking at least two sides. <ref type="bibr">214</ref> The religious identity of a community often rested on its identification with sacred spaces such as temples, shrines, altars, and localities. Their defense was therefore of paramount importance. The growing importance of such centralized sacred sites and the need to defend them contributed directly to the emergence of the polis and consequently stimulated the cultural identity of a settlement. The concept of a deity or deities presiding over the well-being of a community, such as Athena was to Athens, and Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva were to Rome, was a reciprocal process that required a communal effort to defend the tutelary gods. <ref type="bibr">215</ref> Recent theories have proposed interesting suggestions concerning the relationship between religion, politics, and the consequent location of sanctuaries within settlements.</p><p>In Greece religious cults were a crucial factor to the formation of a communal identity in early city states. They often found a place in the center of the city, creating a sense of partnership in the cultic beliefs and ceremonies related to the differing groups that formed the early state. By contrast, in Etruria cults initially found a place in the <ref type="bibr">213</ref> Cerchiai, I campani, 99-100. <ref type="bibr">214</ref> Cristofani "Economia e società," 88. <ref type="bibr">215</ref> Gat, "Why City States Existed? Riddles and Clues of Urbanisation and Fortifications," 130. peripheral arx. Etruscan society placed much more emphasis on the celebration of power through rituals of tribal origin and associated gentilicial cults. <ref type="bibr">216</ref> Ceremonies were therefore linked to the celebration of the individual gens and probably reflected the feudal nature of Etruscan society. <ref type="bibr">217</ref> The investiture of power, or imperium, relied on the correct interpretation of divine will and the promotion of genealogies in the context of myths and local legends. <ref type="bibr">218</ref> Consequently, the ritual of the augurium, or bird watching, and the derived prognostic auspicia placed much significance on the hill tops where it occurred.</p><p>The legitimization of power through such ceremonies entailed that a direct relationship developed between religion, the elite, and the consequent peripheral location of the arx. <ref type="bibr">219</ref> Although the mechanisms are difficult to quantify, similar forces likely governed the location of the sanctuaries at Pompeii. The location of the Temple of Apollo near the political heart and Forum of the city is hardly accidental. Similarly, the two temples on the southern tip of the lava ridge clearly relate to the creation of a community and the legitimization of power over the landscape. Their relationship with the city walls supporting them carried further political and religious significance beyond the direct resemblance of the materials employed to construct them.</p><p>The religious aspect of the city walls at Pompeii is very much attested for later periods and will be discussed in detail below. The very consistency of the courses followed by subsequent enceintes throughout its history suggests that the boundary itself <ref type="bibr">216</ref> Menichetti, M. "The Rituals of Archaic Power."

The notion of a religious boundary around a city is particularly strong in the Etruscan tradition and was associated with the foundation rites of cities. In the ritual known as the sulcus primigenius an augur traced the future boundary of the city using a plow pulled by an ox and a bull. The priest would lift the plow at the location of the future gates of the city, thereby allowing for earthly things to pass through the boundary. <ref type="bibr">220</ref> The Romans also adopted this ritual: the story of the foundation of Rome includes Romulus tracing the boundary of the city on the Palatine. Remus allegedly crossed the boundary illegally prompting Romulus to murder his brother because of the sacrilege he committed against the gods. 221 The resulting boundary, also known as the pomerium, marked the line within which no one could enter armed, and forbade burials and the gathering of assemblies such as the comitia centuriata. The pomerium itself is a rather vague notion with ancient and modern scholars alike arguing over its true meaning, extent, and course. <ref type="bibr">222</ref> Recently Briquel re-examined the sulcus primigenius and defined it as marking the extent of divine protection on the city as well its limits. The associated ritual also expelled otherwise uncontrollable forces of nature. He downplays the religious role of city walls within this context, arguing instead that the walls merely protected rather than occupied the established pomerial boundary.</p><p>223 220 Cato in Serv. ad Virg.

Given the uncertainty of our knowledge it is unclear whether such a ritual accompanied the foundation of early Pompeii, or if the pappamonte enceinte actually followed its hypothetical course. It is entirely possible that the line of the Altstadt actually formed the original pomerium of the city, especially if we consider the area as a separate sacred fortified Etruscan style arx. <ref type="bibr">224</ref> Nevertheless, the presence of a religious element is highly likely and probably related to the fortified line acting as a boundary marker between the urban space and the countryside.</p><p>We know very little of the actual layout of the countryside for this phase of Pompeii except for the presence of the main arteries in and out of the city. <ref type="bibr">225</ref> Yet, both enceintes probably formed an important liminal boundary which included religious and cultural notions of self-determination, identification, and political dominance important to those who financed the buildings. The enclosure also protected sacred sanctuaries which, in turn, also symbolically protected the walls and those inside. The southern approach to the city in particular seems to marry the presence of the pappamonte wall with two of the most important sanctuaries present inside the city. More importantly, both sanctuaries dominated the landscape, thereby serving as physical and religious reference points to the regional community (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_53">19</ref>). Visually the great strength of the walls and the sanctuaries of the gods complemented each other, creating a unified appearance that stressed the strength of the city and its relationship to the territory. These aspects are all the more compelling if we consider the possible foundation of Pompeii as a sanctuary.</p><p>Inevitably this message further legitimized the power of those financing the construction of both the sanctuaries and the fortifications as an extension of their own benevolence on the community and their relationship to the gods.</p><p>The very nature of the pappamonte wall suggests that it carried intrinsic symbolic connotations as a territorial marker in addition to its singular function as a defensive structure. Although it did not represent the most sophisticated fortification system, its route hugged dramatic topographical features, creating a notion of strength and impenetrability. This symbolism extended to a viewer's recognition of the means and resources needed to project such a territorial claim and to construct the wall itself. It is unclear whether the city could muster these resources on its own and perhaps the fortification effort included help from neighboring settlements such as Nocera. <ref type="bibr">226</ref> In any event, although the make-up of the city's population remains difficult to pinpoint, the early settlement probably did not have enough of manpower to defend the entire circuit. As a place of refuge, however, the resulting population increase in times of danger likely partially filled that gap. The large enclosure probably also allowed for a measure of self-sufficiency. It countered the threat of sieges or raids through the territory since the area could probably also accommodate limited farming, and protect livestock, movable goods, and produce from the surrounding farms. As a result, the settlement also functioned as an important psychological reference point offering continuous security to the regional population.</p><p>The walls also allowed a measure of dominance over the population and territory by commanding the land routes through the area and forming a gateway to the Sarno River Valley from the coast. The very use of a local material in the construction of the pappamonte fortification served as a constant visual reminder connecting the settlement <ref type="bibr">226</ref> As we shall see, many scholars view Nocera as the head of a loose federation of cities known as the Nucerian league. Its strength and influence is variously debated and most recently down-played. and its territory. It is hard to project a unified architectural image of the city with both its walls due to the chronic lack of knowledge for the period. Yet, the very similarity of the materials employed for the pappamonte wall, the temples, and the houses suggests a measure of overall aesthetic unity. The unified street layout postulated by Coarelli, probably arranged along some form of geometric land parcellation, established a sense of order to those living within the enclosure. The early walls straddled the main arteries with gates that anchored substantial aspects of Pompeii's urban armature for the remainder of its lifetime. Such a level of consistency, whether intended or not, provided an indispensable measure of familiarity and security to the population of the city. Together all these factors helped shape the community and create the settlement.</p><p>Finally, the construction of the orthostate wall symbolized both a distinct break and a measure of continuity for the settlement. The adoption of new construction techniques and materials along an almost identical course signals a dichotomy of renewal and preservation especially for those experiencing the transitional period between the two structures. The adoption of Sarno limestone, however, also a plentiful regional resource, points to strong local elements at work in the new design. Whether construction of the wall is the result of a political transformation or a deliberate shift in military tactics or both is unclear, but the implications are the same. No other single act could further affirm the dominance on the immediate territory more than the construction of a new wall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 3 A New Enceinte for a New City: Early Samnite Pompeii</head><p>The Samnite period is one of the most complex in the urban history of Pompeii. It started in course of the fifth century BCE when Samnite tribes descended from the Apennine Mountains and conquered the city. Scholars traditionally divide the following age into the early Samnite period, spanning the fifth to the third century BCE, and Samnite Pompeii, lasting from the early second century up to the establishment of the Roman colony in 80 BCE. Much of what occurred early in the period will serve as the foundation of the future city and requires special attention in our discussion. A new vigorous era of development began for Pompeii in the late fourth century BCE, when the city expanded back out into the plateau from the Altstadt. Also dubbed as the Neustadt, the start of the urban expansion coincided with the construction of the third defensive enclosure. <ref type="bibr">227</ref> Its course and structure formed the basis of the future defensive system and much of the layout of the city for centuries to come.</p><p>The remains of the limestone enceinte are still impressive. The outer wall face rises over a series of limestone blocks, 40-50 cm high and 60-80 cm wide, stacked in a header and stretcher system. It features a consistent foundation of limestone blocks reaching a depth of six courses throughout the circuit. <ref type="bibr">228</ref> Internal piers periodically reinforce the façade which leans at a slight angle to hold back a large earthen mound behind it typical of the Italic agger defensive formation (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">5</ref>). The general appearance of the parapet is unknown due, in large part, to the reconstruction and elevation of the wall in subsequent refurbishments. As Sakai points out, it is entirely possible that perishable materials, such as mudbrick, composed the top of the wall and the tufa blocks of the later refurbishment completely replaced it. <ref type="bibr">229</ref> The best-preserved sections of the outer façade still exist along the southern perimeter of the city between Towers II and IV, and a small tract, roughly twenty-two meters long and seven high, just west of Tower XI (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_54">20</ref>). This last section is the most regular, presenting a well-finished section of limestone curtain that gives us a glimpse of its original appearance. <ref type="bibr">230</ref> A few further sections still function as terraces on the western side of the city and offer a few clues on the original make-up of the wall. A small tract of curtain survives beneath the House of M. Fabius Rufus (VII.16.21). The top features regularly spaced indentations that once accommodated terracotta spouts. They drained water from a hanging garden and may have replaced earlier versions in the wall curtain. <ref type="bibr">231</ref> Further south the House of Umbricus Scaurus (VII.16,15-16) preserves a section up to ten courses high that features the only surviving original drainage spout (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_55">21</ref>). Although the evidence is meager, its presence suggests that the wall-walk was unroofed and the spouts drained rainwater from the curtain. The overall height of the structure is debatable, but it probably did not exceed the nine meters estimated for the agger behind. <ref type="bibr">232</ref> A small terracing wall contained the earth mound on the city side and an internal pomerial street hugged the circuit to facilitate communications. <ref type="bibr">229</ref> Sakai "La storia sotto il suolo del 79 d.C.," 94. <ref type="bibr">230</ref> Maiuri, "Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano," 283. 231 R.

The new wall again followed the tactical ridge of the Pompeian plateau and closely shadowed the course of the previous two defensive enclosures. Only in the eastern section, where the previous circuits remain undetected between the Porta Sarno and Tower VIII, did the wall take a wider course to better exploit the ridge line. Past scholars have accepted Maiuri's hypothesis that the new circuit also led to the closure of the gate at the end of the via di Mercurio to strengthen the most exposed section of the defenses. However, both Guzzo and Hori have recently re-assigned this closure to the construction of Tower XI in the late second century BCE. <ref type="bibr">233</ref> Construction crews demolished the outer wall of the previous orthostate fortifications to clear the necessary space for the new curtain, whereas parts of its inner façade were buried in the agger. As discussed further below, the resulting orthostates, too thin and unsuitable for the new fortification, likely ended up in the façades and foundations of new houses going up around the city. <ref type="bibr">234</ref> The choice of building the agger system represents a direct response to the military developments occurring at the time. <ref type="bibr">235</ref> In the second half of the fifth century BCE armies in Greece and southern Italy developed new siege techniques. The weaponry included early versions of rams, mantlets, catapults, and bolt throwers designed to demolish fortifications. New tactics also evolved that included digging tunnels to apply sapping techniques, or building earth mounds and siege towers to climb over the walls.</p><p>Defensive measures changed and engineers developed larger towers, stronger masonry, and outworks where ditches and palisades kept catapults out of range and allowed sorties to harass the enemy positions. By 350 BCE armies had fully implemented the use of siege machines, leading to ever more elaborate enceintes and outworks especially in towns lying in vulnerable open plains where they were most effective. <ref type="bibr">236</ref> These developments required increasingly specialized and organized armies capable of building and supporting the units. In the fourth century BCE authorities, especially in the Hellenistic world, introduced the payroll, leading to professional yearround standing armies capable of mounting longer campaigns, sieges, and permanently occupy enemy territory. <ref type="bibr">237</ref> In Italy the Roman army introduced maniples, small flexible units designed to replace the heavy phalanxes that proved ineffective against the mobile Celtic and Sabine formations it had recently faced. Their versatility also enabled targeted direct attacks on cities and strongholds, resulting in the obsolescence of the existing defenses. <ref type="bibr">238</ref> In response, many Italian cities built anew or revised their defensive systems, including <ref type="bibr">Pompeii. 239</ref> The adoption of the agger in particular is the result of applying new defensive tactics as the heavy earth embankment easily absorbed the vibrations of artillery hits and its weight threatened any tunnelling efforts with cave-ins. If a section of wall did collapse, the embankment continued to offer a measure of protection as the attackers still needed to climb it to enter the city. <ref type="bibr">240</ref> The most sophisticated enceintes featured outworks and towers, but their extent and number for Pompeii is unclear, since the defenses likely responded to the terrain. As in previous the circuits, the high lava ridge near the Altstadt probably precluded the necessity of extensive outworks because of the natural strength of the topography. On the other hand, the Porta Stabia included a forward defensive ditch because of its position at the lowest point of the city opening onto the Sarno plain. <ref type="bibr">241</ref> Excavations in front of Tower IX suggest a similar ditch on the northern side of the city, but the picture for the remainder of the circuit is incomplete. <ref type="bibr">242</ref> The presence of numerous towers is similarly a matter of debate. Maiuri uncovered the remains of one buried under the subsequent expansion of the agger on the northwest tip of the Porta Vesuvio. Its presence has led some scholars to hypothesize that the current towers replaced earlier versions. Others prefer to view it as an isolated example related to vulnerable position of the gate. <ref type="bibr">243</ref> Only systematic excavations can clarify the issue, but it seems likely that other towers further fortified the circuit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROJECTING AN IMAGE: ELEMENTS OF REPRESENTATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS</head><p>The limestone fortifications of the city clearly responded to pragmatic needs. The choice of material, a relatively cheap and plentiful resource lying in banks along the Sarno River Valley, is similarly a practical rather than aesthetic choice. Unlike the hard limestone used in the polygonal masonry walls characteristic of the Apennine region, Sarno limestone is actually a form of travertine. <ref type="bibr">244</ref> It is notoriously difficult to carve beyond basic geometric shapes, but its soft makeup allowed it to be sawed into blocks. This method resulted in the characteristic slightly oblique sides present on most masonry produced by the juxtaposition of the blocks. It quickly strengthened after contact with air and its prolonged exposure to rain led to limestone precipitation that sealed the sutures between blocks and created exceptionally strong masonry. <ref type="bibr">245</ref> Limestone is constantly forming in the Pompeii area; lime is richly suspended in the cold springs of the Apennines and naturally precipitates in the warmer waters of the Sarno plain. As a result, quarrying the stone prevented entire areas from transforming into sterile swaps unfit for cultivation. The process also reclaimed land to expand farming activities. <ref type="bibr">246</ref> To a certain extent, therefore, the growth of the city and its population went hand in hand with the process of land reclamation. The large-scale use of limestone in buildings, and especially its fortifications, not only carried the added benefit of reclaiming land for cultivation, but undoubtedly expressed a strong symbolic statement of the society's domination over the landscape and its desire to expand the city. Hypothetically this factor may even be symbolic of Pompeii's regional reach and the fortifications may therefore also symbolize the limit of its territory in the landscape. Unfortunately, the precise quarries of the limestone remain unknown beyond the general approximation of the area of lower Sarno River Valley. A full assessment of this particular aspect awaits further investigations.</p><p>With this wider symbolic consideration in mind, there are hints of aesthetic concerns at play in the fortifications. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the limestone is its bright yellow color. The ashlars composing the wall surface, dressed smoothly despite the natural coarseness of the material, presented a solid and uniform façade to those approaching the city. The lowest three masonry courses display a rough bugnato, or rustication, as a deliberate aesthetic effect. <ref type="bibr">247</ref> A similar rustication is also present in Greece in the fourth century BCE fortifications at Eleusis. In fact, Greek fortifications display aesthetic considerations stretching back to the ninth century bce walls of Old Smyrna, where a tower displayed a marked purposeful contrast in masonry techniques. <ref type="bibr">248</ref> At Pompeii a decorative socle is most evident in the curtain east of Porta Nocera, south of the Porta Marina, near Tower VII, and the bastions of the Porta Nola and Sarno (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_56">22</ref>). <ref type="bibr">249</ref> Traces of a similar rustication decorated the internal supporting wall spanning the via di Mercurio on the city side of the fortifications. Partially demolished and buried in the later expansion of the agger, the wall survives in a fragmentary state. Large limestone blocks compose the mainstay of the terrace; they are identical to those on the outer façade, but a small section built in tufa spans the width of the street (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">23</ref>). <ref type="bibr">250</ref> It may represent a repair, or a much later closure of the gate at the end of the street, but the dark brown tufa blocks contrast markedly with the yellow limestone. Their smaller size and rustication served to visually emphasize the limit of the agger at the end of the street and particularly contributed to the overall grandeur of the via di Mercurio where we later find a concentration of elite housing.</p><p>Another large structure displaying decorative rustication is the tower or bastion on the northwest tip of the Porta Vesuvio. Steps recovered on its southern side during excavations suggest that the building was once freestanding. The tower supplemented the defenses by standing immediately in front of the gate and added to its formidable appearance. <ref type="bibr">251</ref> The remains rise over eight lower limestone courses surmounted by six in tufa, creating a dramatic contrast that, as we shall in the next chapter, becomes a defining element of the fortifications. <ref type="bibr">252</ref> The tufa blocks on the western side display the remains of a subtle rustication, further highlighting the juxtaposition between the two materials (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_58">24</ref>). The north and east sides now lack the rustication, but it was probably removed in the later modifications of the curtain walls. <ref type="bibr">253</ref> The resulting decorative effect included a prominent socle and rusticated blocks which to some extent prefigure the white First-Style stucco ensembles later applied to the towers and gates of the circuit.</p><p>According to Maiuri the materials used in the construction of the tower reflected two phases: the first using limestone built in conjunction with the fortification, and the second using tufa in a refurbishment that occurred soon thereafter in the first half of the third century BCE. <ref type="bibr">254</ref> However, this assumption is a common problem for Maiuri's theories; there really is no proof for a refurbishment besides the employment of two different construction materials. In my opinion, this choice of materials is a deliberate aesthetic effect which, as we shall in the following chapter, prefigures similar considerations applied to the upgrade of the circuit carried out in the late third century BCE. In fact, given its position and prominence, embellishing such a building is no accident and architects may have employed the two materials for aesthetic or even tactical considerations unknown to us. As noted previously, this area of the fortifications was particularly vulnerable with the terrain sloping gently up Vesuvius to the north and dropping dramatically south into the town. Construction of the tower was primarily a defensive necessity to further protect the gate. Nevertheless, the area is also the highest in <ref type="bibr">252</ref> Only the southern façade differs slightly displaying a few stray limestone blocks in the tufa courses. <ref type="bibr">253</ref> As we shall see in the next chapters, a later lararium in the porta Vesuvio perhaps eliminated the rustication to accommodate a fresco. The north side perhaps worked in a wider decorative scheme featuring the play of tufa and limestone elements, but we shall return to these developments later. <ref type="bibr">254</ref> Maiuri, "Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei," 188.</p><p>the city transforming the tower -and by extension the gate-into a landmark visible for many miles around.</p><p>These examples point to a deliberate concern with the appearance of the fortifications and how they presented the city. Another section of curtain, however, deserves scrutiny because it suggests a disregard of this notion. The stretch, already mentioned above, survives as a terracing structure for the later house of M. Fabius Rufus.</p><p>Its dimensions are conspicuous reaching some nine courses or six and a half meters high.</p><p>The tract has no discernible rustication and displays three vertical masonry seams resulting in misaligned wall course heights (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_59">25</ref>). Admittedly the bugnato may still be buried, but the seams either represent later repairs or mark individual giornate, or days of work, as construction crews moved forward. <ref type="bibr">255</ref> They may also be the product of different construction crews as their workmanship, competence, and technical expertise could affect the integrity of a masonry style in a circuit. <ref type="bibr">256</ref> If anything, the seams are a unique example of the construction process for the city walls of Pompeii. The result, however, contrasts markedly with the regular ashlar masonry elsewhere in the circuit. Perhaps the builders were less concerned with the appearance of the wall here due to its relative isolation from the rest of the city, or the wish to limit expenses, foregoing a careful construction process. Such practices are well-attested in Greece, where towns employed neater masonry in prominent and visible areas as opposed to the cheaper and rougher workmanship of the more isolated tracts. <ref type="bibr">257</ref> Some clear examples of these considerations still exist at Oiniadai, Assos, and Crane. Cities used this tactic to flaunt their wealth and <ref type="bibr">255</ref> Cassetta and Constantino, "Vivere sulle mura," 198.</p><p>256 See Winter, Greek Fortifications, 83. Grimaldi identifies only one seam and thinks it represents the meeting point of gangs of workmen approaching each other at different heights from the north and the south. See M. Grimaldi, "Charting the Urban Development of the Insula Occidentalis and the Casa di Marcus Fabius Rufus." In The Making of Pompeii, edited by S.J.R. Ellis (Portsmouth, 2011), 144. <ref type="bibr">257</ref> Lawrence, Greek Aims in Fortification, 235. create more imposing defenses on their approach routes, and such considerations were clearly also at work in Pompeii.   With these factors in mind, it is the gates that should carry the most distinct representational elements. As mentioned, the first Samnite wall forms the mainstay of the later fortifications and this period also sees the definitive anchoring of the gates into the city. In some shape or form many gates were already open in the earliest enceintes, but it is with this circuit that they started acquiring their present architectural layout. The only real modification is the eventual closure of the gate at the end of the via di Mercurio due to the vulnerable topography and the proximity of the Porta Ercolano and Vesuvio. <ref type="bibr">258</ref> Most scholars recognize the Porta Stabia as the oldest gate because of its primary limestone construction. The other gates adopted a similar layout, and scholars have projected the reconstruction of the Porta Stabia upon the other gates of the city.</p><p>The current appearance of the gate is the result of later additions, but the basic plan remained unchanged: two forward bastions followed by a long internal passageway through the agger and an internal threshold into the city (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">26</ref>). The remains have generated a rather intense scholarly discussion concerning its original appearance. Much of the debate centers on whether the exterior bastions supported an arch, if the steps leading to the parapet featured an intermediate landing, the length of the inner passageway, the exact position and number of gates closing the passageway, and whether the opus incertum arch replaced an earlier tufa version. <ref type="bibr">259</ref> All of these discussion points relate to the original design of the gate as a Vorhoftor, or forecourt gate, which came in many variants but usually featured some sort of overhead passage linking the external bastions and internal thresholds. From a military perspective the design was intended to trap any attackers in the court of the gate, allowing defenders to pelt enemy troops from above. <ref type="bibr">260</ref> Although the current remains do not allow an accurate reconstruction, they do point out how differing construction techniques highlighted a distinct tripartite division of the passageway. The roadway originally sat five meters lower, resulting in a formidable cavernous appearance to the gateway. <ref type="bibr">261</ref> The bastions, composed of solid horizontal ashlar masonry, indicated the most powerful exterior line of the fortifications. <ref type="bibr">262</ref> Although some like to see a portcullis closing the passage, a two-leafed gate likely marked entry into the court where vertical orthostate blocks signaled the transitional space between the exterior and the interior of the city. If we consider Krischen's reconstruction, the court walls originally followed the slope of the agger allowing for gradient flanking positions against the enemy and accentuating the power of the defenses. <ref type="bibr">263</ref> The inner threshold, perhaps marked by another gate or, as is in the later version an early vaulted passageway, announced the transition into the urban space. Each element acted as a clear stage marker for any traffic passing through the gate further distinguished by the differing construction techniques (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_61">27</ref>).</p><p>Maiuri believed that the differing techniques represent specific construction events where the orthostate blocks of the gate court correspond to the first phase followed <ref type="bibr">260</ref> See Brands, Republikanische Stadttore in Italien, 8-29. <ref type="bibr">261</ref> Maiuri, "Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei," 191. <ref type="bibr">262</ref> For the exact dimensions of the various blocks see Fiorelli Gli scavi di Pompei dal 1861 Al 1872, 80. <ref type="bibr">263</ref> Krischen, shows a two leafed gate.

Overbeck, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken (Leipzig, 1875), 55.  by the addition of the two outer bastions. <ref type="bibr">264</ref> Recent excavations, however, suggest a single construction event for the gate; they also raise a series of questions on the construction techniques employed. Admittedly, the masonry types relate to differing styles and the court walls use the emplecton technique in a similar fashion to the earlier orthostate wall. This circumstance may simply be the result of their role as a reinforcement to hold back the agger. Yet the choice of using orthostate masonry may also relate to a desire to differentiate and highlight the steps of passage through the agger into the city. Rites of passage between spaces are crucial elements to notions of inclusion and exclusion in communities. <ref type="bibr">265</ref> Fortifications in particular expressed a taboo against accessing the other side, and gates represented magico-religious liminal areas in between internal and external spaces. As discussed further in the next chapter, they also represented the social, territorial, and political status quo of the city. Arnold van Gennep in particular describes three distinct stages for territorial passages: the separation or preliminal, the transitional or liminal, and the incorporation or post-liminal. <ref type="bibr">266</ref> Whether their design was deliberately aesthetic or a necessity to reinforce a passage through the agger remains uncertain, but the masonry seems clearly manipulated to highlight the three steps of inclusion and exclusion to the community. We find a similar tripartite division in the fauces, or entrances to the houses of Pompeii, composed of a long corridor with distinctive thresholds on either side. Their liminal role led to their protection under four divinities: Janus as the overarching guardian, Ferculus who watched over the door leaves, Limentius who protected the threshold and lintel, and finally Cardea who attended the hinges. <ref type="bibr">267</ref> Because of their multivalent liminal roles, city gates and fortifications often received special religious protection or carried apotropaic devices to protect the community. <ref type="bibr">268</ref> As discussed further below, eminent examples still exist in the Porta all'Arco in Volterra and the Porta Marzia in Perugia. The Porta Stabia still carries two small niches carved into the eastern wall face of the court for the veneration of a deity protecting the walls and travelers traversing the liminal space. The top niche functioned in the final phase of the gate and excavators recovered it fully coated in stucco and carrying a graffito in the back reading PATRVA-a reference to Minerva Patrua. <ref type="bibr">269</ref> The lower niche is associated with two previous phases that included a small altar buried into the later sidewalk (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_62">28</ref>). Its first phase belongs to the original construction of the gate at the dawn of the third century BCE. The second dates to the late second century BCE when a fill related to the reorganization of the defenses partially buried the altar.</p><p>Nevertheless, a new coat of stucco attests that the shrine remained in use. The fill contained the remains of votive offerings, including the upper half of a small terracotta statue broken into three pieces. The published drawing shows a female figure in a frontal pose, but she remains unidentified due to a lack of defining attributes. If we allow for a continuity of cult she likely represents Minerva and, as discussed further in chapter five, her frontal pose is similar to a statue of the goddess recovered at Porta Marina.

The subtle decorative embellishments on the fortifications are the expression of a confident city. To better understand their role in creating a sense of civic unity, we turn again to the urban area they enclosed to see how they resonated in the architectural and social layout. Scholars have variously dated the limestone fortifications, but the most recent consensus sees their construction occurring in the late fourth/early third century <ref type="bibr">BCE. 271</ref> This is also the period when the Sarno Valley becomes a war theater during the Second Samnite War and Roman troops landed near Pompeii to sack the inland territory of Nocera in 310 BCE. <ref type="bibr">272</ref> It is unclear whether the limestone circuit already defended the town during this incursion. In any event, the troops headed directly inland completely ignoring Pompeii, either because of its relative unimportance or because it possessed a well-defended enclosure. The subsequent ambush and defeat of the Roman troops at the hands of a peasant uprising, however, indicates a typically Samnite de-centralized territorial occupation, and suggests that the inhabitants temporarily sought refuge in strongholds such as <ref type="bibr">Pompeii. 273</ref> This picture would soon change after Pompeii, along with Nocera, entered into an alliance with Rome as a civitas foederata at the end of the war. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">274</ref> The picture for fourth century BCE Pompeii is one of a few modest homes situated near the Forum and the Triangular Forum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">275</ref> Its new alliance resulted in a wave of wealth and commerce as Pompeii extended its contacts with the east, southern Italy, and Rome to the north. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">276</ref> The remains of shops found on the eastern side of the Forum point to the gradual establishment of a merchant social class capable, perhaps, of financing some of the new building projects in the city including the defenses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">277</ref> The question concerning who or what acted as a catalyst for the construction of the new circuit is difficult to answer primarily because of the chronic lack of knowledge for the social make-up of the city. The few graves related to the Samnite period found outside of the Porta Stabia and Ercolano offer little evidence other than pointing out that the practice of burying the dead outside of the city walls was already current. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">278</ref> The sheer scale of the operation, however, suggests the involvement of some outside element, such as neighboring Nuceria or Rome, for military expertise and financial backing especially if we consider the scattered occupation of the hinterland. The new relationship of Pompeii with Rome in particular sparked a re-birth of the city that included extensive social and religious alliances that influenced the remainder of its history. <ref type="bibr">279</ref> Besides the fortifications, few public buildings date to the end of the fourth century BCE. Recent work on the House of the Cretan Forms (VII, 4, 62) revealed the remains of a possible public banqueting space, or hestiaterion, indicating the presence of a strong Greek social custom throughout the third century BCE. <ref type="bibr">280</ref> The older cults in the city also received renewed attention. The Temple to Apollo regained importance and votive offerings soon resumed. <ref type="bibr">281</ref> Around 325 BCE the Doric Temple in the Triangular Forum received a general refurbishment including the addition of a new roof with metopes and acroteria representing Hercules and Athena/Minerva Phrygia. <ref type="bibr">282</ref> This cult in particular, as we shall see in chapter five, is a regional political phenomenon that scholars associate with either a renascent league of cities headed by neighboring Nocera, or with the new Roman alliances developed after the Second Samnite War. <ref type="bibr">283</ref> The new fortifications are intimately connected with this refurbishment, functioning as a new terrace platform for the temple and reasserting the dual martial and divine protective elements on the city. This development seems especially apt considering Minerva's role as protectress of cities and it will remain a consistent element in the religious character of the fortifications.</p><p>New dwellings accompanied the expansion of wealth and a certain amount of controversy surrounds the appearance of the houses during the late fourth and the third centuries BCE. Much of it concerns whether limestone featured as the primary construction material. Giuseppe Fiorelli first defined the architectural history of the city associating it broadly to the main historical developments occurring on the Italian peninsula. He described three distinct periods loosely connected to the use of building materials; limestone, tufa, and concrete and brick. Mau later refined these periods to five: the limestone period which includes the so-called houses with limestone atria, the tufa period, the early Roman colony, the Imperial period, and finally the post 62 CE earthquake reconstructions. <ref type="bibr">284</ref> The framework still forms the basic premise for the architectural history of Pompeii, although recent scholarship rightly blurs the lines between the phases by pointing out that materials and techniques can cross over into later periods. It is not the purpose of this dissertation to dive into the complexity of the debate concerning the accuracy of these time distinctions and the questions raised by subsequent excavations. As Jean Pierre Adam points out, the question of a true limestone phase for the city remains debatable due to the paucity of remains, differing quarrying rate of the materials employed, and the continued use of limestone materials into later periods. <ref type="bibr">285</ref> Nevertheless, the earliest houses at Pompeii feature some clear similarities in their design and construction technique. The House of the Scientists (VI.14.43) and the House of Amarantus (I.9.11-12) form the earliest attested examples with their first phase dating <ref type="bibr">284 Fiorelli, Gli scavi di Pompei dal 1861</ref><ref type="bibr">Al 1872, 78-86.

The façades are actually rather somber and uniform solids, pierced occasionally with small window slits allowing light into the house. <ref type="bibr">290</ref> The evidence from Regio VI suggests that First-Style decorative programs embellished the 286 A.

They also identify houses VI,14,39 and VI,14,40 as having almost identical facades. interiors of the houses, but no indications exist for their exterior. <ref type="bibr">291</ref> Prior to the eruption wide swaths of First-Style stucco coated the limestone façades on the via di Mercurio, but they probably functioned to disguise repairs conducted after the earthquake of 62 CE, or they were part of a new image to the city developed in the Roman period. As highlighted in the next chapter, house owners in the following tufa period often opted to leave the masonry naked for the intrinsic statement of the stone. If the limestone façades featured no further embellishment then their construction technique and material clearly created a dialogue with the city walls. Together the house façades and the walls created a distinct unified image.</p><p>As mentioned above, Amedeo Maiuri suggested that blocks used in some of the limestone façades are actually spolia of the external orthostate wall demolished to make way for the new agger. <ref type="bibr">292</ref> Eschebach elaborated this notion further and emphatically stated that the earliest limestone façades are actually all composed of re-used blocks from the orthostate wall. <ref type="bibr">293</ref> Recent investigations in Regio VI uncovered further evidence for the use of spoliation blocks in house foundations and façades. <ref type="bibr">294</ref> Yet, as attractive as assigning these blocks to the orthostate wall may be, this theory rests on similarities in measurement that could potentially represent uniform quarrying standards. Nevertheless, many of the blocks are likely spolia. Their reuse is probably primarily a matter of expediency, but they may also carry a more symbolic significance.</p><p>The very survival of these façades up to the eruption, even after the interiors saw radical alterations, poses some important questions. As elite houses, their façades likely carried a more important representational element related to the status of the owner. Furthermore, many limestone houses sit above pre-Samnite examples and such a continuity of place might relate either to their prime location or the incorporation of a select elite into the Samnite town. <ref type="bibr">295</ref> Although difficult to quantify, the re-use of the blocks may therefore also represent a measure of antiquarianism, nostalgia, ancestral continuity, or conquest and renewal of the city. The first three notions are difficult to gauge and they depend on whether parts of the orthostate wall were visible, and their possible interpretation as a relic. Although the excavations at Tower IX suggest that parts of the inner façade remained visible for an extended period of time, these factors remain almost impossible to ascertain without further evidence. <ref type="bibr">296</ref> However, the notions of conquest and/or renewal likely accompanied the initial construction process of the new wall. These are messages are more implicit and immediately tangible in the execution of such a large construction project.</p><p>The expansion of building activity at Pompeii included the basic arrangement of its street network. The layout has generated much discussion and is important since it acts as the armature for the city's future development. The city walls and the gates essentially anchored the main access routes in and out of Pompeii. Other entry points, in the form of posterns or towers, probably aligned along minor north-south and east-west roads dividing up the plan. <ref type="bibr">297</ref> Although no direct evidence exists for a re-foundation of the city, the coherent layout is the product of a single plan. It led early scholars to equate it with the first foundation of the city, and any possible associated rites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">298</ref> The design rests with the equidistant via Stabiana and via di Nola each forming the main north-south cardo and east-west decumanus of the city (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_64">30</ref>). The via dell'Abbondanza acts as a second decumanus and the two divide the via Stabiana into three equal sections. The third section also returns in the length of the via di Mercurio and the distance between the Porta Sarno and Nola, whereas the gap between via di Nocera and the via Stabiana is exactly half the length of the cardo. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">299</ref> The city subsequently expanded in a tiered development in precisely parceled plots set out along the main axes. Regio VI developed first followed by the line of insulae along the east side of the via Stabiana. The intervening space with the outer Altstadt filled up soon afterwards and the development later continued into the eastern portion of the city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">300</ref> As in the Archaic period, the enclosed area never achieved full urbanization. Regio I and II in particular remained thinly occupied with agricultural buildings up to the eruption of Vesuvius. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">301</ref> A similar but more extensive picture for farmland within the enceinte exists for the early Samnite period. Post-holes related to agricultural work uncovered beneath Insula I in Regio VI and excavations near the Porta Stabia suggest a lack of urbanization between the fourth and mid-second centuries BCE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">302</ref> The arrangement of the walls and the main street network are clearly interrelated, suggesting a desire to monumentalize the city. <ref type="bibr">303</ref> Such an orchestrated design raises the question whether there is any further meaning to the layout and, by extension, the course of the walls. A pragmatic approach identifies a primarily militaristic scheme where the walls and street network interacted to offer the greatest defensive capabilities and the minor roads facilitated communications toward the individual sections of the enceinte. <ref type="bibr">304</ref> Beyond this secular martial explanation there is no shortage of more abstract theories.</p><p>Without digressing too far into the intricacies of the general debate concerning archaeoastronomy and urban foundations, the discussion for Pompeii centers on the orientation of the streets and its developmental history. The problem in essence revolves around identifying a predominantly Greek, Etruscan, Samnite, or Roman character of the city. Orthogonal planning was a secular endeavor for the Greeks where roads were predominantly oriented according to topographic or hygienic considerations requiring that a city opened to the winds for a healthy environment. <ref type="bibr">305</ref> This approach, however, already found its critics in antiquity: Roman architect Vitruvius believed that winds were actually detrimental to good health. <ref type="bibr">306</ref> These ideals, however, were theoretical and not always practiced. Much more debate surrounds Etruscan orthogonal plans; many scholars describe the symbolic designation of the celestial templum onto the city. In essence, two axes divided the great heavenly sphere into four distinct quadrants that found their earthly correlation in the notion of the circular city, its central mundus, and the cardo and the decumanus inscribing the urbs quadrata. <ref type="bibr">307</ref> This idea, however, has received heavy criticism since it relates primarily to the orientation of temples rather than cities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">308</ref> Finally the Roman agrimensores, or land surveyors, borrowed heavily from Etruscan ideals but transformed them into more secular notions. They often used the solstices to align the centuriation of the countryside, perhaps also as a time keeping device, but symbolic patterns in town plans are less evident. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">309</ref> The arguments for Pompeii are quite long and complicated, and relate primarily to the history of theories concerning the city's development, i.e., the grand design envisioned by early scholarship versus the Altstadt/Neustadt theory and its later adaptations. Castagnoli summarizes the debate up to 1971 and the arguments, with the exception of a brief summary, need no repetition to the same level of detail here. Early scholarship recognized the via di Nola as the cardo and the via Stabiana as the decumanus of the city. Their intersection was the central square, or the mundus, and the original starting point for the layout of the city. Leading proponents of a grand Pompeii argued for the pomerium of the city following the present line of the Samnite walls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">310</ref> With the introduction of the Altstadt theory scholarship identified the via di Mercurio/via del Foro/via delle Scuole as the cardo, whereas the via Marina/via dell'Abbondanza acted as the decumanus. At their intersection the Forum formed the new origin point for the layout of Pompeii and, as a recent hypothesis suggests, an Etruscan foundation of the Altstadt. <ref type="bibr">311</ref> As a result, the pomerium probably followed the line of the Altstadt fortifications, whereas the later Neustadt instead followed a Greek design with multiple cardines and decumani primarily secular in nature. <ref type="bibr">312</ref> Hans Eschebach, applying Le Gall's model derived from the principles of the Roman agrimensores, suggested a somewhat more symbolic layout. He points out that both the via dell'Abbondanza and the via di Nola align with the summer solstice, whereas the via Stabiana closely lines up with the winter solstice. <ref type="bibr">313</ref> De Caro takes the notion further identifying the via di Nola as creating a deliberate axis with Monte Torrenone to the east where the federal sanctuary of Foce Sarno marks a source of the Sarno River (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_64">30</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">314</ref> The same orientation is also present in the street network of neighboring Nocera, where a similar urban transformation occurred in the early third century BCE, including the construction of an agger defensive system. The alignments symbolize a wider political union and re-birth after their insertion into the Roman sphere of influence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">315</ref> Felice Senatore poses some serious doubts to these assertions pointing out that these aligned axes actually miss the source of the river and the sanctuary probably did not exist yet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">316</ref> Despite such reservations, Guzzo recently used the theory to place the entire territory outside of the city and its division under the divine protection of the federal sanctuary. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">317</ref> By inserting the landscape into the equation its layout, i.e., the parcellation of the land and the roads running through it, adds more importance to the role of the fortifications since their placement also anchored the division of the countryside. As a result, they acted as a distinguishing and yet unifying element for the city and its territory, essentially acting as a filter point for movements in and out of Pompeii. The expansion of the city required a higher rate of agricultural production leading to an early centuriation of the landscape. Although much of the Pompeian chora remains buried and therefore difficult to characterize, a well-organized landscape supporting the city is highly likely. Scholars project the land parcellation of Regio VI continuing, by osmosis, on axis with the via Mercurio beyond the walls by the second half of the fourth century BCE. They hypothesize a similar centuriation laid out along the via di Nocera toward the Sarno River. <ref type="bibr">318</ref> Presumably, this organized landscape existed along the main routes outside of the other gates, but its extent is unknown. Whether the orientation of Pompeii's streets carried deliberate symbolic associations or was coincidental due to the topographical layout of the plateau remains hard to ascertain. <ref type="bibr">319</ref> In fact, projecting Etruscan and Roman foundational rites on Pompeii may seem somewhat premature in light of the tenuous evidence and the rich diversity of the region.</p><p>The most recent theory on the layout of the city departs radically from traditional views. Francesco Vitale assigns precise astronomical connotations to the layout of Pompeii, correlating the course of the walls to a perfect ellipse. Inside temples and gates align along precise linear patterns to create a protective religious umbrella resembling a pentagram over the city (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_65">31</ref>). He notes that this layout follows precise astronomical 318 F. Zevi, "Urbanistica di Pompei." In La regione sotterrata dal Vesuvio. Studi e prospettive.

The layout is therefore primarily the result of the city's original foundation as a sanctuary evidenced by the plateau's relative isolation from readily available water sources. Its burgeoning sacred groves subsequently grew to such an economic importance that they necessitated the construction of fortifications to keep out thieves and brigands. <ref type="bibr">320</ref> The approach is interesting and Pompeii may indeed have been founded as a sanctuary. Some of the conclusions however are, in my opinion, a little far-reaching. <ref type="bibr">321</ref> Although the exact meaning of Pompeii's layout, if any, remains difficult to quantify, it seems likely that military concerns and topographical elements primarily dictated the urban framework. <ref type="bibr">322</ref> The picture for Pompeii is one where the city lays the groundwork for its future appearance. This is a massive operation that included laying out streets, regularizing the countryside, and constructing the walls. With the gates opening onto regional roads, these elements will remain virtually unchanged for the remainder of the city's history, creating a clear factor of continuity for its population. <ref type="bibr">323</ref> The streets also created visual axes focusing either on the agger or towers resulting in the fortifications creating a constant visual presence throughout the city and continuously projecting a sense of security on its population. As discussed further in the next chapter, 320 F. Vitale, Astronomia ed esoterismo nell'antica Pompei e ricerche archeoastronomiche a Paestum, Cuma, Velia, Metaponto, Crotone, Locri e Vibo Valentia, in particular see p. 59, 89- <ref type="bibr">94. 321</ref> This is primarily because the arguments rest on a set of coincidences and arbitrary connections drawn from lines on a map. Lines, in essence, that can be drawn and interpreted arbitrarily, creating endless connections and interpretations. <ref type="bibr">322</ref> For a recent assessment on the heavy influence of topography on the layout of Pompeii see M. Holappa and E.M. Viitanen, "Topographic Conditions in the Urban Plan of Pompeii: The Urban Landscape." In The Making of Pompeii, edited by S.J.R. <ref type="bibr">Ellis (Portsmouth R.I., 2011): 169-190 323</ref> Only the Porta Marina, perhaps, lay slightly further a-back at the tip of the hill. The evidence for this is scant but some scholars believe that the remains of a few blocks on the eastern end of the precinct of the temple of Venus are the remains of an earlier version of the porta marina. See P. Arthurs, "Problems of the Urbanization of Pompeii. Excavations 1980-1981." The Antiquaries Journal 66 (1986): 29-44.  the towers in particular, if they indeed existed in this period, also projected a measure of internal security acting as small fortresses capable of controlling the population. In essence it means that, to some extent, notions of security permeated the rest of the city's history, consciously or unconsciously affecting those living inside the protection of its walls.</p><p>Initially at least the use of earth and the Sarno limestone projected a strong association amongst the town, the fortifications, and its hinterland. This seems particularly the case if the massive use of limestone resulted in extensive land reclamation supporting the expanding city. The spectacle of constructing the walls, including quarrying and transporting the stone blocks, and the hundreds of carts needed to transport the agger earth must have been quite impressive. Pesando identifies Regio VI as one of the sources for the earth, suggesting a local and perhaps even immediate retrieval of the fill in proximity of the fortification throughout the city. <ref type="bibr">324</ref> Maiuri suggests, due to the completely sterile nature of the earth, distant unspecified locations for its retrieval, but either scenario further strengthens the bond between city and territory. <ref type="bibr">325</ref> A further connection between the city and its walls occurred through Pompeii's architecture. The limestone façades of elite houses and the ashlar masonry of the walls connected on multiple levels where a local material, used in a local context, fostered a local identity. These factors are most evident in the subtle decorative additions on the curtain wall and gates of Pompeii. The city walls encompassed a wide open area interspersed with housing aligned along an orthogonal plan with a slightly more densely occupied Altstadt. In simple terms this configuration created a dichotomy between the Altstadt and the Neustadt, or old and new, reflected primarily in the fortifications, and it also established the space for Pompeii's future expansion. The walls also responded to the latest developments in warfare and encompassed a wide area to accommodate the population of the chora; they established a measure of self-sufficiency with extensive protected farmland within the enclosure.</p><p>The walls also worked on a wider territorial scale. The parcellation of the city and parts of the countryside created a distinct imposition and artificial organization on the landscape. The walls in essence acted as a crown highlighting the new organization, simultaneously unifying and distinguishing the city and countryside through dominance and imposition. It is no surprise, therefore, that as in the previous periods a strong connection also exists between the fortifications and its sanctuaries as visual landmarks on the city and the hinterland. Both structures functioned to legitimize the power of those who financed the projects, their status in the city, and their relationship with its protective deities. In many ways the city and its chora form one unit and its image, as Zanker describes for the late Republican period, will be cultivated by both the community and the individual. 326 At Pompeii the groundwork for this trend starts in the late fourth century BCE and will continue to gather pace and diversify in the centuries to come. All these factors symbolically translated into the new defensive bastion. The use of decorative elements in the walls confirms the presence of a communal identity. This principle translated into the concept, or idea, of the city as is reflected in the extensive unity of its urban, territorial, and architectural layout. Although the reasons for the dramatic expansion of Pompeii remain enigmatic, strong political and social forces shaped its appearance. Its image and, by extension, the fortifications enclosing it are a reflection of the society that built Pompeii and their concept of the ideal city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 4 Establishing an Image: The Fortifications and the Golden Age of Pompeii</head><p>The previous chapters have focused primarily on the architectural relationship between the appearance of the city and its walls, and to a certain extent the anthropological aspects of fortifications affecting the population. This approach was necessary because of the paucity of any other evidence for early Pompeii. Our picture becomes clearer for the second century BCE since much more evidence, including inscriptions and more copious physical remains, allows for a more in-depth analysis on the performance of the fortifications. However, many of the aspects discussed up to this point will continue to form a backdrop in what follows. An important element to remember in this chapter is that the momentous urban and social development of Pompeii continued under both Roman and Hellenistic influences that remain difficult to quantify.</p><p>Both 'Hellenization' and 'Romanization' are terms that are the object of a heavy scholarly debate that I will not engage with here. Nevertheless, the Pompeian alliance with Rome strongly influenced the city; whereas the increased exposure of both cities to the Hellenistic world, and the strong Greek character of the early Bay of Naples, blurs the assignation of a single distinct cultural influence upon Samnite <ref type="bibr">Pompeii. 327</ref> After the establishment of the limestone fortifications the defenses undergo a radical transformation. The intervention on the walls is rather difficult to date precisely, but scholars generally view it as a response to the Second Punic War. The scenarios are multiple with the upgrade occurring in conjunction with gathering war clouds, during the conflict itself, or as a general need to reinforce weak fortifications after the hostilities. <ref type="bibr">328</ref> Scholars, therefore, generally agree that the intervention occurred at the end of the third century BCE. The defenses received a substantial reinforcement featuring a new internal wall, a higher outer curtain, and an expansion of the agger. The material adopted for this intervention is tufa, a dark grey/brown volcanic stone found primarily in the Lattari Mountains near the neighboring city of Nocera. The resulting visual contrast with the previous limestone masonry seems deliberate, reflecting the social and architectural developments of the city (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_66">32</ref>).</p><p>The area between the Porta Ercolano and Vesuvio highlights the main elements and reasons behind this massive reinforcement (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">5</ref>). The most marked of these is the presence of the internal wall performing both structural and defensive roles. Rising higher than the external curtain, the wall created a second terracing structure allowing engineers to widen and equalize the wall-walk. It also supported a higher agger and functioned as a secondary parapet, setting up two lines of defense against attackers. <ref type="bibr">329</ref> The overall increased height provided cover for neighboring houses, as well as for troops and supplies moving along a street that ran along the inner base of the fortifications. <ref type="bibr">330</ref> The internal wall also relieved the outer curtain from the pressure exerted by the agger, which had probably caused many previous collapses. A series of regularly spaced internal piers mirroring those on the external curtain further stabilized the structure. Although tufa composes the majority of the wall a few interspersed limestone blocks derive from the partial demolition of the old terracing wall on the city side of the agger.</p><p>331 Where 328 See Chiaramonte Trerè,"The Walls and Gates," 142.

Isolated sections on the western side of the city still feature large parts of limestone curtain where their double function as terracing walls ensured their preservation. Despite its inherent advantages, the internal wall is notably missing at the Porta Stabia and at Tower IX where a remnant of the orthostate wall supported a lower agger. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">332</ref> East of the Porta Vesuvio the new internal wall actually acted as the terrace holding back the agger until an opus incertum wall, likely built in conjunction with the later towers, accommodated its expansion further south. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">333</ref> A large tufa stairway offering access to the wall walk replaces it between the Porta Ercolano and Tower XII. The internal reinforcement is also absent near the amphitheater, although this circumstance is probably related to its demolition to make way for the arena. Excavations beneath the Temple of Venus point to the presence of a single tufa terracing wall dating to the early third century BCE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">334</ref> In light of the natural strength of the Pompeian plateau, it is questionable whether the full defensive system continued farther east toward the Doric Temple. Here, although the terrace received some new tufa masonry, the desire to maintain the view probably precluded the presence of an extensive agger. 335</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMESTONE, TUFA, AND THE CREATION OF A NEW STATEMENT</head><p>Although the internal wall is not consistent, the addition of several courses of tufa ashlars on the external curtain largely is. The intervention on the north side of the fortifications increased its height from eight to eleven meters, creating a dramatic contrast with the earlier limestone masonry. <ref type="bibr">336</ref> The battlements of both walls have now completely disappeared. According to the earliest descriptions they included L-shaped merlons extending onto the internal piers reinforcing the façade. This shape best covered the front and left sides of the defenders, while liberating their right arms to pelt the enemy with projectiles (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_67">33</ref>). <ref type="bibr">337</ref> Today only three capping stones still lie in the vicinity of the battlements; one on the wall-walk west of Tower XII, and two just outside of the Porta Nocera. All three bear signs of a joint on the top right, suggesting that they originally capped the inner pier. An extended cornice, lined with spouts to drain rainwater from the wall-walk, marked the transition between the curtain and the parapet but scholars are again divided on its appearance. The recovery of a spout carved to resemble a lion's head outside of the Porta Stabia is a case in point. Excavators first thought it was the keystone to the arch of the gate, but August Mau identified it as a spout and projected it as adorning the entire circuit. <ref type="bibr">338</ref> The piece has since disappeared and only survives in an old photograph that restored it next to the outer bastion of the gate.</p><p>Extending the presence of the type on the entire fortification is a little far-fetched and some scholars, including Maiuri, tend to ignore it.

A brief survey of the evidence, however, proves otherwise. This is particularly the case on the south-east of the city where the limestone blocks between</p><p>Towers II and IV reach six to eight courses high and still dominate the curtain. At first glance this façade is composed entirely of limestone in a very different fashion than the rest of the circuit for this phase. However, a closer look at the evidence indicates that four courses of completely unworked blocks at the bottom of the wall were once hidden from view in a foundation trench. Their exposure is the result of soil erosion accelerated first by the cutting back of the cliff to make the wall more inaccessible, and a later lowering of the terrain to ease access through the Porta Nocera in the early colony. <ref type="bibr">341</ref> Proof comes from the similarly exposed foundations of Tower III, the Porta Nocera, and particularly Tower II which still displays a high floating postern (fig.35). 342 A few surviving tufa blocks east of the Tower II confirm a layout more consistent with the rest of the circuit. They sit above nine limestone courses. If we subtract the lowest four courses as buried 339 Krischen, Die Stadtmauern von Pompeij,plate 5. 340 Starting with Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1 pl.

The remaining tufa blocks, including large parts of the Porta Nocera, disappeared after earthquake of 62 CE to provide much-needed building material for the ensuing reconstruction effort. <ref type="bibr">343</ref> The next evident limestone/tufa juxtaposition runs between Tower V and the Porta Sarno. Here the number of lower limestone courses varies considerably, ranging between three and six in number. We must consider, however, that in all probability twentieth-century restorations/repairs form large sections of curtain, since modern cement holds much of it together and the tufa blocks carry modern tool marks. The exact height of the limestone is therefore difficult to trace, but minor variations in the number of courses were likely difficult to notice when viewed from below considering the high ridge supporting the walls (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_70">36</ref>).</p><p>Continuing from the Porta Sarno we find the most regular limestone/tufa setup of the entire circuit between Tower VII and the Porta Nola. The number of upper tufa courses varies according to their survival rate. The lowest limestone blocks form a consistent level platform of three courses (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_71">37</ref>). Admittedly, excavations here could potentially reveal further lower courses, but the platform is remarkably consistent. A similar situation exists between Porta Nola and Tower VIII. The first twenty-seven meters directly west of the gate display four lower limestone courses supporting two surviving in tufa. A section some twenty-three meters long follows with five lower limestone courses of slightly smaller block dimensions that may belong to a later refurbishment (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_72">38</ref>). A subsequent heavily damaged and most probably spoliated section only displays three limestone courses and no tufa. The next thirty meters leading up to Tower VIII are more regular; two lower limestone courses support between four and ten blocks of surviving tufa. <ref type="bibr">344</ref> Further west, the section running from the Porta Vesuvio to the mid-mark between Tower X and XI displays an identical setup where four lower limestone courses support the tufa framework above. Today the juxtaposition is not immediately apparent since much of the limestone is buried beneath an earth fill dating to the early Imperial age and a large dump of debris resulting from the 62 CE earthquake. <ref type="bibr">345</ref> The façade, perhaps the most intact of the circuit, is remarkably consistent, with grey tufa as the primary construction material, a few lonely brown tufa blocks, and a rare limestone ashlar west of the tower (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_73">39</ref>). <ref type="bibr">346</ref> The blocks are uniform in size, about 41-42 cm high, with slightly taller stones of 67 cm expressly highlighting the parapet. <ref type="bibr">347</ref> The wall face changes slightly twenty meters west of Tower X where the socle increases to six courses and the parapet displays a few courses of later repairs using limestone. The curtain continues west as a patchwork of tufa and opus incertum materials with a consistent limestone socle up to the completely re-built tufa wall associated with an earlier phase of the current Porta Ercolano.</p><p>The west side of the city features a prominent differentiation of construction techniques due, in part, to the function of the wall as a terrace.

The neighboring House of Maius Castricius (VII.16.17), however, again displays a very well finished tufa framework resting on a few courses of limestone. Beyond the Porta Marina, the southwest ridge of the city again shows a unique set of circumstances. Recent excavations beneath the Temple of Venus uncovered the remains of a tufa terracing wall built at the turn of the third century BCE.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_105">foot_105</ref> This date is much earlier than the rest of the upgrade, and the use of tufa may relate to an earlier effort to highlight the prestige and prominence of the area. This seems especially the case if, as discussed in the previous chapter, we consider that a similar use of materials deliberately differentiated to the tower extending in front of the Porta Vesuvio.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_106">foot_106</ref> Turning the corner toward the Doric Temple the wall disappears beneath and is embedded into later houses. A study of the area conducted by Noack and Lehmann-Hartleben identifies nine surviving sections of the exterior walls spaced out between Houses VIII.2.29-36. Terrace 20 in House VIII.2.29 in particular, displays two tufa blocks still carrying mason marks flanking a limestone block still in situ. Terrace 19 in House VIII.2.30 displays a similar superimposition of construction techniques, with Sarno limestone blocks incorporated into later opus incertum masonry and still partially covered in stucco. <ref type="bibr">351</ref> Finally a small tract of wall composed of two tufa courses surmounting a limestone socle survive as a terrace for the Triangular Forum (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">14</ref>). As is the case with the previous enceintes the fortifications on this side of the city functioned primarily as a terrace and lacked the agger. In this role the fortifications would dictate the orientation of the houses and preserve their memory in the streets and the outskirts of the area.</p><p>The work on the external curtain is, at first glance, a simple reinforcement. If this represents the original height of the limestone framework with tufa additions, however, then the previous fortifications were too low for an effective defensive curtain rising, on average, only some three to four courses (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_74">40</ref>). Scholarship has struggled to explain this situation or often chosen to ignore it. The recent excavations near Tower IX propose a different scenario pointing to a short time interval between the limestone and tufa curtains. <ref type="bibr">352</ref> These results suggest that the first Samnite wall perhaps never reached full completion before its upgrade. It might very well be that the lower limestone courses first supported a superstructure in perishable materials, such as wood or mud-brick, later substituted with tufa. <ref type="bibr">353</ref> In fact, engineers often applied a stone socle as a common remedy to protect mud-brick walls from rainwater damage, and this hypothesis might explain the relative regularity of the lower courses. <ref type="bibr">354</ref> Furthermore, Vitruvius specifically recommended travertine as an ideal material for wall foundations due to its load bearing capacity. <ref type="bibr">355</ref> Although no evidence exists for a mudbrick superstructure, these factors suggest that the limestone socle was a deliberate choice and is not entirely arbitrary.</p><p>The switch from limestone may have occurred for a number of reasons, including the simple exhaustion of quarries, or the discovery of tufa as a more versatile</p><p>352 Sakai and Iorio, "Nuove ricerche del Japan Institute of Paleological Studies sulla fortificazione di Pompei," 328. 353 Sakai, "La storia sotto il suolo del 79 d.C.," 94. 354 Winter, Greek Fortifications, 62. 355 Virtuvius II.7.2. construction material. 356 As a result, the Japanese team recently concluded that the previous limestone phase probably never existed and that the two materials actually represent one phase. 357 Such a notion is not unique to Pompeian scholarship and to a certain extent falls back to the hypothesis of a single grand foundation for the city. The very regularity and alignment of the two walls composing the fortifications have led Overbeck and Richardson to a similar conclusion. 358 Curious, and little noticed by successive scholars, is Maiuri's own admission of this possibility when he uncovered the walls and Tower III south of the Palestra. 359 This kind of debate is symptomatic of the scholarship on the city walls at Pompeii, creating an often confusing and divergent set of ideas. Even to this day, however, Maiuri's excavations remain the most exhaustive in their exploration of the entire circuit and his account is generally accepted as the most accurate in terms of building sequence of the walls. 360 With the exception of Sakai's perishable materials hypothesis, none of the theories satisfactorily explain the low height of the limestone courses throughout most of the circuit. If anything this might be conclusive evidence that the limestone/tufa wall represents a single construction event. Scholars recognize similar uses of distinct materials for decorative effects in the ninth century BCE fortifications of Old Smyrna and in the late Archaic walls of Buruncuk-Larisa in Greece. 361 Nevertheless, we may consider 356 The exhaustion hypothesis seems especially plausible if we consider that construction crews actively sought out and used the quarries closest to the city walls as a measure of expediency. Lugli, La tecnica edilizia romana, 65-69. 357 Etani, Pompeii: Report of the excavation at Porta Capua, 1993-2005, 308. 358 Overbeck, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken (Leipzig, 1854), 40-41. Richardson, Pompeii: An Architectural History, 45. <ref type="bibr">359</ref> Maiuri, "Muro della fortificazione," 233 the scholar noted the similarity of the quarry marks on both walls which, along with an almost uniform size of the tufa and limestone blocks, and an alignment of the piers, suggest a single construction effort. <ref type="bibr">360</ref> Chiaramonte Treré, "The Walls and Gates," 141. <ref type="bibr">361</ref> See Winter, Greek Fortifications, 79-80.  that engineers perhaps deliberately shaved off significant sections of the limestone to actually seek out a distinct aesthetic effect while building the walls. The application of these two construction materials results in a very distinct effect of chiaroscuro-all the more evident when rain water accentuates their colors (figs. 32, 35-38). This factor likely represents an explicit decorative effect applied to the walls since the number of courses of each material, although varying slightly, actually displays a marked consistency. If the tufa does represent a distinct later construction phase, the differentiation of materials marks the extent of the intervention and signals the amount of work and investment carried out on the fortifications. This is a clear stamp upon the walls and, by extension, a projection of power upon the city by those financing the refurbishment. However, if we consider, as early scholarship did, that the limestone and tufa actually represent a single construction event, then the aesthetic consideration behind this façade is all the more evident. In any event, the contrasting effect of materials played a significant role in the appearance of the walls, and-as we shall see-throughout the city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emphasizing the Passage In and Out of the City</head><p>Along with the reinforcement of the curtain walls during the tufa period, modifications to the gates -based on the forecourt prototype of the Porta Stabia highlighted in the previous chapter-began to shape their appearance. According to Maiuri, their refurbishment included substituting the limestone of the gate-court with tufa, and building a vault marking the threshold into the city. <ref type="bibr">362</ref> The Porta Nola, as the best preserved example, formed the basis of his chronology and he readily identified the tufa blocks in the opus incertum masonry of the later vault as relics of an older arch, with the most noticeable functioning as struts for the double-doored internal gate (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_75">41</ref>). The protome of Minerva, the keystone of the current arch, along with a few voussoirs and an adjacent inscription, belonged to the earlier vault and represented examples of continuity or nostalgia. A stylistic comparison between the bust and carved capitals decorating house doorways in the city supplied Maiuri with a tentative date of 200-150 BCE for the first arch. <ref type="bibr">363</ref> Much of this theory is highly debatable and any further evidence for this substitution of arches is otherwise completely lacking, inducing many to believe that the tufa vaults never existed. <ref type="bibr">364</ref> Regarding the gate court walls, the substitution thesis is equally problematic but to a certain extent seems more plausible as some sort of retaining wall must have held back the earth to allow passage through the agger. Recent excavations at the Porta Vesuvio have identified a foundation trench dating the construction of the western wing to the late third and mid-second century BCE. <ref type="bibr">365</ref> The new passageway walls served to further accentuate the tripartite layout of the gates discussed in the previous chapter for the Porta Stabia. In addition, we find the same contrast of differing construction techniques with the court walls laid as orthostates in direct opposition to the horizontal ashlars of the bastions. These elements are clearly visible in the Porta Nocera, Sarno, Nola, and Vesuvio, where the passageway blocks contrast markedly with the limestone masonry of the bastions (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_76">42</ref>). <ref type="bibr">366</ref> The subtlety of the Porta Stabia design gives way to a far more marked differentiation to the functional elements of the gate. More importantly, the limestone/tufa juxtaposition dialogues directly with the outer curtain, suggesting the presence of an overarching aesthetic in the design of the fortifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Porta Nocera</head><p>More evidence for this factor and, perhaps, its long-term continuity comes from the Porta Nocera. The gate repeats the familiar layout: outer limestone bastions, followed by a tufa gate court and a concrete vault. A lowering of the road passing through it in the late Republican-early Augustan period revealed the opus incertum foundations (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_77">43</ref>). <ref type="bibr">367</ref> With regard to the fortifications, scholars usually associate the use of opus incertum solely with the later construction of the vaults and the towers. The concrete at Porta Nocera, however, displays a seamless transition between the vault and the foundations. Furthermore, the steps buried in the agger on the west side of the passageway suggest that a gateway already existed here in the first limestone enceinte.</p><p>Unless the inner walls were lifted and put back into place, which seems unlikely, the passageway and vault are the result of a single construction event using concrete and tufa. <ref type="bibr">368</ref> This sequence directly counters Maiuri's substitution hypothesis and points to the construction of the court and vault occurring in a single event. It also leaves us with some important observations. The current layout of the Porta Nocera is possibly a late addition directly emulating other gates in the city, or a later refurbishment carefully restoring the tufa masonry, or the gates are part of a single construction event perhaps associated with the towers. In any event, these scenarios each contain an element of universal design, 367 D'Ambrosio and De Caro, Un impegno per Pompei, 24. A few elements confirm that these are indeed the foundations. The lowest blocks still carry quarry marks, as opposed to the smoothly dressed higher courses, suggesting that they were once buried and hidden from view. Further elements confirming the original height of the road are the unduly high sidewalks leading up to the gate and the tufa struts in the vault. They once supported the original closing gate and now hang high above the exposed foundations. <ref type="bibr">368</ref> Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 34.</p><p>suggesting a deliberate consideration of uniform aesthetics and presentation for the city and its walls.</p><p>Given the uncertainties concerning the date of the first introduction of opus incertum at Pompeii, the Porta Nocera also forms an important piece of evidence for the early use of this construction technique. Giving an exact date for the construction of the gate remains difficult. The tombs in front of the gate provide a terminus ante quem for the lowering of the road and hence construction of the gate to the early Roman colony, 369</p><p>whereas the tufa addition to the nearby curtain likely occurred at the start of the second century BCE. Perhaps most importantly, the recent excavations of the passageways at the Porta Stabia and Vesuvio have not revealed a similar use of opus incertum for their foundations. <ref type="bibr">370</ref> In addition, as highlighted further below, new investigations have recently downdated the concrete vault at the Porta Stabia to the early colony. To a certain extent, therefore, it seems that the walls at the Porta Nocera are a laboratory for the application of opus incertum as a new construction technique. However, only further excavations at the gate can pinpoint its date and role in the city more definitively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Porta Ercolano</head><p>Further evidence for a concerted representative design element concerning the gates comes from the Porta Ercolano. The gate is currently a three bay monumental arch that replaced an earlier version in the Augustan period or, as a recent re-evaluation suggests, after the earthquake of 62 CE-but we will return to this form later.</p><p>371 The 369 D'Ambrosio and De Caro, Un impegno per Pompei, 24 370 Seiler et.al., La Regio VI Insula 16 e la zona della Porta Vesuvio, 224; Devore and Ellis, "The Third Season of Excavations at VIII.7.1-15 and the Porta Stabia at Pompeii.

Although not unknown in antiquity, the resulting angled entrance design was counter-intuitive to military concerns.</p><p>As noted above, architects designed the so-called Scaean gate types at an angle to force the enemy to expose their right unshielded side to the defenders. The Porta Ercolano design, as do both the Porta Marina and Nola, does the opposite and the reasons are probably related to the layout of the original terrain. Maiuri's excavations demonstrate that the northern bastion sat on a small natural terrace that influenced the orientation of the gate and added a more formidable aspect of the fortifications. <ref type="bibr">372</ref> The oblique angle has also led scholars to speculate that the previous road aligned with the via Superior currently passing in front of the Villa dei Misteri. <ref type="bibr">373</ref> Despite the design variation compared to the other gates in the city and its almost complete disappearance, the Samnite Porta Ercolano included the same differentiation of materials explicitly highlighting the entrance into the city.

Although the Samnite gate has now largely disappeared, it seems that its design and the use of tufa reflected the wider aesthetic considerations concerning the walls in one of the most visible and frequented entrances to the city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Porta Vesuvio</head><p>Neighboring Porta Vesuvio presents its own unique variation of the basic plan (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">14</ref>). As noted earlier, the gate is placed at the most vulnerable point of the defenses and it responded to its weak position with the addition of a forward tower extending from its western flank. The tufa refurbishment filled in the tower, transforming it into a forward bastion incorporated into the wall curtain. Although it is badly damaged, excavations have shown that a similar bastion extended in front of the gate's eastern flank. The resulting layout transformed the gate into a formidable defensive outpost where the double tufa and limestone bastions created a deadly cul-de-sac (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_79">45</ref>). This strategic consideration explains why, unlike the other gates of the city, the Porta Vesuvio featured a closing gate on the field side of the limestone bastions so defenders could isolate attackers more effectively. As discussed further in the next chapter, two altars dedicated to unspecified deities protected the walls and those passing through the liminal passageway into the city. <ref type="bibr">376</ref> Behind the forward entrance, the familiar gate court built in tufa isodomic masonry extended into the city. Whether, as Sogliano suggested, another vault once existed on the city side of the gate remains unclear due to the heavy damage it sustained during the earthquake. <ref type="bibr">377</ref> Despite the alterations, the gate again staged a powerful three-step entry into the city, with the only exception that the curtain rather than <ref type="bibr">376</ref> See Sogliano, "Relazione degli scavi fatti dal Dicembre 1902 a tutto Marzo 1905," 99-100. 377 Recent excavations did not conclusively resolve the issue since any internal vault likely succumbed much earlier to make way for the neighboring Augustan castellum aquae See Seiler et.al, "La regio VI insula 16 e la zona della porta Vesuvio," 219-224 and 230-233.</p><p>the limestone bastions announced the passage into the city.

According to the traditional view, the work conducted on the walls included the addition of the towers, a decorative vault on each of the gates, and the reconstruction of large parts of the outer curtain. We have seen, however, that the remains of the Porta Nocera and Porta Stabia suggest a more complicated construction sequence that needs further investigation outside of the present thesis.</p><p>Nevertheless, engineers resorted to opus incertum as their technique of choice to erect the towers and gate vaults. The material is a cheap form of cement faced with irregular, fist-sized stones allowing rapid construction and adaptability to molds; it is usually covered with stucco to mask its crudity. Scholars currently equate most of these works as a response to the gathering clouds of the Social War, but it is hard to assess this kind of foresight. In fact, the upgrade may also represent a reaction to the very real threat posed by Rome's war with the Cimbri and the Teutones that included battles in the Po valley. In any event, Pompeii fits into a general trend of the late second and first centuries BCE when cities throughout Italy increasingly upgraded or built new defenses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">378</ref> This activity is part of a wider tendency of Italian settlements to add the essential architectural elements such as theaters, baths, temples, and fortifications, to complete their image as a city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">379</ref> The extent of this refurbishment is especially problematic to pinpoint regarding Romanelli, sees the opus incertum as repairs conducted after the Sullan siege. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">380</ref> Mazois, in a theory recently revived by Richardson, carried this idea further by also including the towers to the post-Sullan period, built in response to the civil war under Caesar. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">381</ref> Niccolini and Overbeck-Mau subsequently dismissed the notion, believing that the sections are too extensive to represent the damage of a single siege. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">382</ref> Soon afterward, Sogliano discovered the graffito with the letters L.SULA in Tower XI and ascribed it to a victorious Roman soldier who scratched it into the stucco as a reference to L. Sulla in the aftermath of the siege (fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). <ref type="bibr">383</ref> Mau subsequently suggested that the peace following the Second Punic War led to the abandonment of the fortifications and their spoliation for building material. A panicked restoration at the outbreak of the Social War led to the opus incertum wall plugs and the construction of the towers. <ref type="bibr">384</ref> Maiuri navigated either side of the debate proposing that the opus incertum can represent both pre-and post-Social War construction activity, but placed the towers firmly in the last quarter of the second century BCE. <ref type="bibr">385</ref> The proponents of the theory advocating a temporary abandonment of the city walls commonly point to the development of the southwest portion of the city as a key argument. <ref type="bibr">386</ref> In the late second century BCE private dwellings started encroaching upon the walls to exploit the grand views toward the Monti Lattari and the Sorrento peninsula to the south and west (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_80">46</ref>). This development certainly weakened the defenses in this part of the city, but the precise extent of the occupation remains somewhat unclear. As we have seen, the steep precipice in the sector needed few supplementary defenses beyond terracing walls, and most houses featured grand terraces on the ridge which troops could still occupy and use defensively if necessary. <ref type="bibr">387</ref> The defenses therefore could still withstand long protracted sieges and it is only after the establishment of the colony that houses eventually enveloped the walls.</p><p>In short, assigning the construction of all the curtain walls built in opus incertum Another analysis similarly proposes that the opus incertum east of the Porta Ercolano represents a post-siege repair. <ref type="bibr">391</ref> The reality is that repairs and reconstructions, especially those using similar construction materials, are generally very difficult to pinpoint, let alone to date. Further compounding the problem is the ubiquitous use of both tufa and opus incertum in the period, often in the same structures. Beyond a stucco veneer, tufa, and later also marble, covered the cement, ensuring its use well into the Roman colony. <ref type="bibr">392</ref> The result is an uncertain periodization which only further systematic excavations can clear up.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">to</formula><p>388 CIL X 937.</p><p>Fiorelli, Gli scavi di Pompei dal 1861 Al 1872, 89.

See Hori, "Pompeian Town Walls and Opus Quadratum," 288-289. We should keep in mind however, that such a conclusion rests on the notion that only Roman builders used this measurement. This fact remains hard to prove and only if we dismiss the possibility of itinerant architects providing technical know-how. <ref type="bibr">392</ref> The schola tombs outside of the gates are just one of many examples.</p><p>In the absence of further evidence, we can perhaps draw some educated guesses.</p><p>For example, the tract south of the amphitheater probably relates to the arena's construction, which also led to the partial removal of the agger and the demolition of the internal wall. Similarly, the sections outside the Porta Nola, Porta Stabia, and the north side of the city, probably necessitated extensive repairs; they probably bore the brunt of heavy attacks during the Sullan siege because of their vulnerable position. Other sections functioning as terraces immediately west and east of the Temple of Venus are probably related to housing construction or the refurbishment of the sanctuary occurring in the first century BCE. <ref type="bibr">393</ref> For the sake of my analysis I will assume that most opus incertum sections in the curtain largely represent colonial repairs, with the hope that future excavations and studies will further clarify the situation. <ref type="bibr">394</ref> With these issues in mind, a few distinctions in the ashlar masonry suggest that some curtain refurbishments occurred using the limestone/tufa framework. Maiuri identified a small section of limestone and tufa curtain some forty-seven meters west of Tower XI that is less finished and homogenous, and may represent a repair (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_65">31</ref>). <ref type="bibr">395</ref> Similarly, Chiaramonte Trerè pinpointed a twenty-three meter stretch of wall located twenty-seven meters west of the Porta Nola where slightly smaller limestone blocks may represent a later refurbishment. <ref type="bibr">396</ref> Nearby, Hori recently recognized repairs carried out on the curtains flanking Towers VII and VIII during their construction. <ref type="bibr">397</ref> In each case, these <ref type="bibr">393</ref> For these results see E.

The insertion of the towers led engineers to lower the agger to ease the access into the new buildings, thereby revealing much of the undressed masonry and the quarry marks on the blocks of the internal wall. <ref type="bibr">398</ref> More importantly, the secondary inner parapet largely disappeared, moving the line forward and pinning defense on the dominating height and firepower of the towers (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_81">47</ref>). 399</p><p>The new layout also led engineers to pierce new access points to the wall-walk through the internal wall. A clear example, walled up at an unspecified later date, still exists between Towers X and XI where a small postern cut into the tufa blocks still connects with the agger elegantly sloped to reach it with ease. Recently Russo and Russo have proposed a radical alternative to the traditional reconstruction of the walls for this phase. Rather than seeing the inner tufa wall as the relic of a secondary parapet, they envision it as supporting the rear of a roof covering the entire wall-walk sloping toward the field-side of the walls (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_82">48</ref>). They attribute the complete disappearance of the roof to the systematic destruction of the wall-walk to demilitarize the wall after the Sullan siege. A subsequent reconstruction effort conducted in the early colony included patching up the walls with opus incertum and the addition of spouts needed to drain rain water from the open battlements. <ref type="bibr">400</ref> Both roofed wall-walks and the demolition of battlements are not unknown in antiquity; they carried the distinct <ref type="bibr">398</ref> Maiuri, "Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei," 120 this is most evident in the section between the Porta Vesuvio and Ercolano. <ref type="bibr">399</ref> On the strategic advantages of towers see</p><p>Adam, L'Architecture militaire Grecque, 46-76 400 F.

Only a curtain section fifteen meters east of Tower XII displays a top course of vertical limestone orthostates alternating tufa spouts set on ashlar masonry. Unless they also represent repairs to the battlements, their presence disproves the theory of a previously covered wall-walk.</p><p>The only truly intact part of the wall top comes from a section of the city walls on the northwestern tip of the vicolo dei Soprastanti. Here six limestone columns engaged in the same opus incertum masonry of the curtain below stand to demarcate the edge of the road from the cliff below (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_83">49</ref>). Stylistic analysis of the Doric capitals suggests their contemporaneity with the towers. <ref type="bibr">403</ref> The absence of battlements implies that the wall here did not carry much military value with the minor exception of a small triangular slot designed perhaps as viewing window, or as a firing slit covering the adjacent walls below. Although it has now completely disappeared, stucco very similar to that covering the towers probably decorated this stretch of walls. With little military value, the section clearly formed a purely decorative marker emphasizing the edge of the city.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New Elements to Old Passages</head><p>The use of opus incertum in the vaults of four gates, the Porta Stabia, Nocera, Sarno, and Nola, has led scholars to date them to the same period as the towers. As mentioned above this view is debatable, and recent excavations at the Porta Stabia concluded that its vault in particular is likely a post-colonial construction. <ref type="bibr">404</ref> Although construction of the vaults is perhaps more haphazard than previously thought, their addition and overall embellishments are part of a grander design that completed the tripartite passage through the agger. The Porta Nola, the best surviving example of the type, highlights how the juxtaposition of limestone, tufa, and stucco accentuated the transition (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_76">42</ref>). Its current appearance is a prime example of private euergetism benefitting the city. An Oscan inscription, once encased in the masonry next to the bust of Minerva and now in the British Museum, described how the meddix, or magistrate, Vibius Popidius the son of Vibius, constructed and dedicated the gate (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_84">50</ref>). <ref type="bibr">405</ref> It reads: v. půpidiis v | med tův | aamanaffed, | isidu | pruphatted 406 404 Devore and Ellis, "The Third Season of Excavations at VIII.7.1-15 and the Porta Stabia at Pompeii. Preliminary Report," 14. 405 According to Mazois, Mau, and Maiuri The inscription first went to Paris see Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1, 27. Also see Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 46; Maiuri, "Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei," 213; Nissen Pompeianische Studien,511; Conway The Italic Dialects, (Cambridge, 1897), 45 mentions that it ended up in the British Museum 406 R.

Vetter, Handbuch der Italischen Dialekte (Heidelberg, 1953), Ve 22.</p><p>Vibius, a rather rich wine trader belonging to the powerful Popidii clan, also built the tufa colonnade still partially surviving on the south side of the Forum. <ref type="bibr">407</ref>  We shall return to the significance below, but for the sake of clarity the First-Style decorative scheme usually featured a formulaic scheme consisting sequentially of a socle, followed by orthostates, ashlars and topped with a frieze.</p><p>Stabia and Porta Nola he describes the vault interiors as carrying a yellow elevated socle receding into a simple smooth white plane above. 410 Such a scheme is relatively straightforward, but the Mau explicitly warns against seeing too much simplicity in the decoration, and praises the stucco itself as the highest achievable quality. <ref type="bibr">411</ref> We find some solace in the earliest depictions of the gates, although their usefulness is often lessened by their schematic nature due to the abandoned or re-buried state of the structures. <ref type="bibr">412</ref> Furthermore, they are often black and white prints of engravings with limited detail and exclude any colors on the gates. French architect Mazois produced some of the earliest and most accurate renditions. His cross-section of the Porta Nola in particular reveals an apparent election notice painted onto the tufa of the passageway and an important detail: the lack of stucco covering the masonry of the gate court and the outer bastions (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">51</ref>). The decorative effect of the gates therefore included the bare masonry, creating a contrast between the inner vaults and highlighting the individual steps of passage. The depictions of the Porta Nola, including an engraving published by William Gell, also reveal a far greater surviving extent of the stucco on the vault, with sections of smooth plaster still in situ next to the inscription and the female bust. <ref type="bibr">413</ref> Neither author emphasizes Mau's yellow socle which, although discolored, is still distinguishable today. There is no trace of the imitative ashlars typical of the First-Style found on the towers and Porta Ercolano, but with so much of the evidence gone it is hard 410 A.</p><p>Mau, Pompejanische Beiträge (Berlin, 1879), 236. 411 A. Mau, Geschichte der Decorativen Wandmalerei in Pompeji (Berlin, 1882), 58. See previously Gell, who describes the stucco as finest quality on towers and gates. W. Gell Pompeiana: The Topography, Edifices and Ornaments of Pompeii (London, 1832), 90. 412 Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 52, for example, refer the reader to Mazois for the buried sections of the Porta Nola. 413 Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1, plate XXXVI fig. 1 and 2; Mazois incidentally distrusts the placement of this inscription, as Maiuri, does after him as well, attributing it perhaps to a restoration of an earlier vault. 153. See Gell, Pompeiana, pl. 29.</p><p>to assess the embellishments on the vaults with any greater certainty. It may very well be that the stucco on different gates featured slight variations, responding perhaps to differing construction or restoration events, the wishes of different patrons, or even, as we shall below, their placement and association with particular districts of the city.</p><p>Complicating the matter further is the large gap between their first construction and the eruption, a period in which the individual structures may have changed their appearance.</p><p>A Eschebach points out that it likely functioned as an <ref type="bibr">416</ref> See next chapter for further discussion. <ref type="bibr">417</ref> Aoyagi and Pappalardo, Pompei. Regiones VI -VII, Insula Occidentalis, 491-493. overflow for a system of cisterns set slightly further uphill, but damage wrought on the area by allied bombing makes this claim unverifiable. <ref type="bibr">418</ref> It seems evident therefore that most of the planning of the city street drainage system accompanied the construction of the inner vaults, if not earlier. These events are hardly surprising, suggesting that the concern for civic décor also included proper drainage systems for the city streets. The choice of using the gates for this role is mostly practical as they naturally tend to be downslope on the easiest access routes into the city and were part of the public land of the fortifications. Gates on the upslope side of the city, such as the Porta Ercolano, do not include any drainage system, whereas the Porta Vesuvio later became the arrival point of the aqueduct into the city. From a military perspective drains could actually weaken the circuit by providing access points into the city and their presence near the gates made them more defensible. <ref type="bibr">419</ref> More importantly, the drains also strengthened the notion of control on all things entering and exiting the city. This notion also relates to the sulcus primigenius ritual where gates were the designated interruptions in the protective boundary allowing all impure earthly things to pass through. <ref type="bibr">420</ref> Religious symbols also formed an important aspect to the overall decorative program of the gates. Perhaps the most recognized religious symbol is the keystone on the city side of the Porta Nola (figs. 41 and 50). Today much of it is damaged beyond recognition except for a few identifiable locks of curled hair and the base of a helmet on the neck. A certain amount of controversy has surrounded the sculpture ever since its discovery due, in part, to its poor state of preservation and the translation of the inscription. Scholars first mistranslated the last two words of the inscription, isidu pruphatted, as meaning that Vibius Popidius dedicated the vault to Isis and concluded that the carving represented the Egyptian goddess. A later translation identified the words as "dedicated it" and changed the identification of the head to Minerva because of the helmet she wears. <ref type="bibr">421</ref> Presumably such busts decorated more than just one of the gates at</p><p>Pompeii but no others were found in situ. Olga Elia describes another keystone, unfortunately without context, conserved at the antiquarium. The heavily damaged head probably depicts a female figure. Although it might resemble a keystone, we can draw no further conclusions since it may come from other vaults (fig.53). 422 In fact, the only other carved keystone still in situ in the city decorates the access arch of the western dromos in the main theatre and depicts either Dionysus or a Satyr. 423 Other gates carry divergent religious references. On the north side of the city the Porta Vesuvio displays the remains of a lararium on the western tip of the gate. Today much of the evidence has disappeared but Sogliano describes the recovery of two altars in the cul-de-sac on the northwest side of the gate during his excavations of in the early twentieth century (fig. 54). Stucco and fresco once covered the altars and walls above them, but any identifiable signs had already deteriorated beyond recognition at the time of excavation. Presumably, as with so many other lararia throughout the city, the fresco depicted the public lares protecting the city, but any further interpretation is elusive. 424 421 The most complete engraving of the bust is on the cover of De Clarac and Mori, Fouille faite à Pompei.

As protective gods of the Roman state they symbolically embraced Volterra as a direct extension of its territory, and simultaneously acted as a statement to anyone approaching the gate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">429</ref> The Porta di Giove at Falerii Novi features a head of Jupiter decorating the keystone. It likely references the city's relationship with Rome since it was responsible for the foundation of the settlement in 273 BCE as a measure to re-locate and control the recalcitrant inhabitants of Falerii</p><p>Vetres. The fortifications themselves carried further symbolism. They included over fifty towers regularly spaced throughout the circuit even in inaccessible places in no danger of attack. This circumstance is primarily due to the role of fortifications as part of the appropriate presentation of the new city rather than just defensive needs. Along with the Perugian example, Falerii Novi particularly validates the notion that walls developed from purely defensive elements into integral parts of the urban image. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">430</ref> As we shall see in the next chapter, the presence of Minerva on the defenses of Pompeii likely carried a similar political and religious motivation.</p><p>The elements of representation present in the city gates may also relate to their function as tax barriers. We should keep in mind that the gates fulfilled this function since the first enceinte up to the eruption of Vesuvius, but the expansion of the city led to their increasing importance in this role. In simple terms they were collection points where gatekeepers and tax collectors stopped people and goods passing through. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">431</ref> As stopping points they could also cause congestion on busy streets, especially when engineers designed them primarily as narrow passageways concerned with defense. Gates were important policing barriers and could be shut at night to prevent the uncontrolled passage of people and goods into the city. <ref type="bibr">432</ref> In fact, gatekeepers, as the holders of the gate keys,</p><p>were so important to the safety of the city that Aeneias the Tactician expressly highlights the need to keep a close watch on them and their loyalty during a siege. <ref type="bibr">433</ref> The gates therefore also carried with them intrinsic symbolic elements as formal policing barriers related to the state and prevented smuggling. In this role they also functioned as a distinct screen symbolizing the city and its authority. These factors make the architectural correlations between the city walls, the gates, and the urban image all the more compelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Towers</head><p>Despite the uncertainties concerning the curtains and gates, the similarities in plan and decoration point to the construction of the towers occurring in a single event. In essence engineers inserted the towers into the curtain by demolishing the outer wall. The buildings consisted of three floors with interconnecting stairways. They straddled the wall-walk and extended slightly beyond each side of the two parapets (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_90">56</ref>).

The niche, however, is an honorary tomb for Marcus Cerrinius Restitutus, see Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 44. 432 On gates in their taxing and policing functions see R.E.A.

As evidenced by the buried bastion in the Porta Vesuvio, a distinct possibility exists that these towers replaced earlier versions, 434 but only further archaeological excavations can prove this hypothesis.</p><p>The reconstructions of the towers divide chronologically along the interpretations provided first by Mazois and later by Maiuri after his 1929 excavations. Each recognized a three-story building but fundamentally differed on the final reconstruction (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_91">57</ref>).</p><p>Mazois believed that the top floor was unroofed; he proposed a small covered stairway in the rear which he decorated with a Doric frieze after the recovery of a few pieces of stucco. He based his reconstruction on an amalgam of the ruined remains of Towers VII, X, XI and XII. With their elevation gone he projected the three window openings on the lowest floor onto those above. <ref type="bibr">435</ref> His drawings remained the standard in subsequent publications until Maiuri uncovered substantial pieces of Tower X buried in the volcanic fill in front of it. The pieces allowed him to reconstruct a gabled roof ornamented with a Doric frieze, and four windows on the second and third floors. Maiuri also based his reconstruction on the fresco of the brawl in the amphitheater where the towers clearly show regular roofs. <ref type="bibr">436</ref> Curiously, and for reasons that remain unclear to me, the currently rebuilt remains of Tower X feature crenellations rather than a gabled roof. Perhaps this reconstruction follows Mau's suggestion that the pediments were added to the towers when they were demilitarized. <ref type="bibr">437</ref> The most recent reconstruction, discussed further <ref type="bibr">434</ref> See De Caro, "Lo sviluppo urbanistico di Pompei," 78; Chiaramonte Treré, "The Walls and Gates," 143 for the replacement theory. <ref type="bibr">435</ref> Mazois , Les ruines de Pompéi.

Excavations have since proved that this is part of a domestic dwelling built during the colony phase and known as the Villa Imperiale. More concrete evidence exists for Tower I. We know of the existence of at least twelve structures and their counterclockwise numbering through the eituns inscriptions. The inscriptions, a distinct group of six painted in red throughout the city, pointed the way to individual sectors of the fortifications for the eituns, or Samnite troops, defending the city during the Sullan siege. <ref type="bibr">439</ref> We shall return to their significance below, for now we can highlight that two of them describe Towers X and XII as the buildings east of Porta</p><p>Vesuvio and west of Porta Ercolano. With the current number of unearthed towers at eleven and the counterclockwise count, most authors locate Tower I at the western tip of the Triangular Forum. The area is still buried today and excavations announced in 1966 have yet to take place. 440 If a tower did indeed exist here it likely created a stunning visual relationship with the Doric Temple nearby, reinforcing the divine and martial aspects of protecting the city. 438 Russo and Russo, 89 a.C.: Assedio a Pompei, 59. 439 R.

Bonnet actually placed it just west of the Porta Stabia but he did so on an assumption that it would have covered the gate with flanking fire. Subsequent excavations have tended to disprove the theory. See P. Bonnet, "Pompéi quartier des théatres mémoire P. Bonnet 1858." In Pompéi traveaux et envois des architects français au XIX siècle (Naples, 1981), 329.</p><p>One of the most striking aspects of the towers is their unequal spacing and general indifference to military precepts. Vitruvius and Philon of Byzantium both recommend towers regularly spaced within an arrow's flight to offer mutual cover against attackers. <ref type="bibr">441</ref> Ideally they should protrude considerably from the curtain and their designs should be round or polygonal to better resist bombardment and avoid weak corners vulnerable to battering rams. Furthermore, their masonry should be separate from the curtain to prevent large sections on the wall collapsing with it if a tower goes down during the fighting. 442 At Pompeii we find the opposite with square towers almost flush with the wall and concentrated in the most vulnerable areas in the north and southeastern sectors. This layout is invariably related to Pompeian topography. The proximity of the walls to the natural tufa ridge inevitably forced the towers into the curtain. <ref type="bibr">443</ref> The ridge, however, carried the distinct advantages of inaccessibility and the look of great height, thereby imparting a formidable appearance to the circuit. The placement of Tower V at the tip of the amphitheater, for example, certainly worked in a defensive context, but also carried decorative and monumental elements giving the entire area the appearance of a fortress (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_103">70</ref>). <ref type="bibr">444</ref> Although at first glance the siting and concentration of the towers might appear to be primarily related to weaknesses in the circuit, their location is not entirely arbitrary.</p><p>For instance, the location of Tower X essentially transformed the Porta Vesuvio into a massive Scaean gate by forcing attackers to expose their right unshielded side to direct</p><p>441 Vitruvius I.5.4.

I.62 443 Johannowsky attributes this to the layout of the terrain and the presence of a fossa, forcing the towers into the walls. See W.

Towers VI, VII, and VIII are spaced exactly halfway between neighboring gates or drastic angles in the circuit. These more isolated buildings essentially acted as small fortresses defending their sectors more effectively. <ref type="bibr">445</ref> The towers also invariably appear at the end of streets commanding the internal axes that facilitated communications toward them. As a result, they were a constant visual presence in the city (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_92">58</ref>). Beyond their defensive character, fortifications, by their very nature, also functioned as effective policing structures by restricting population movement and providing expedient tax barriers at the gates. <ref type="bibr">446</ref> The towers, in essence, dominated the city, imposing a measure of population control, and forming a last line of defense if any enemy troops managed to overcome the walls.</p><p>A few examples serve to highlight how fortifications also dominated the city.</p><p>Aineias the Tactician, writing on how to survive a siege, repeatedly warned against the threat internal plotters posed and advised authorities to take measures to expel or appease them in the event of a siege. <ref type="bibr">447</ref> Control of the walls was so important and symbolic that the Roman army awarded a special corona muralis, or mural crown, as a distinction to the first individual to scale an enemy wall. <ref type="bibr">448</ref> A single episode amongst many in Livy's history of the Second Punic War should suffice to further elucidate the notion. He describes the citizens of Henna in Sicily demanding the keys of the town gates from the Roman soldiers occupying the walls since they considered themselves freemen allied to 445 De Caro,"Lo sviluppo urbanistico di Pompei," 72 and 77-79. The recent excavation of Tower IX with its placement at a great oblique angle in the fortifications confirms this concern with tower placement. 446 I. Pinder, "Constructing and Deconstructing Roman City Walls: The Role of Urban Enceintes as Physical and Symbolic Borders," 74. 447 See Aineias the Tactician Book 6, 11, and 14. See Aeneas and D.

The implication here is that the keys to the gates and therefore the fortifications symbolize the liberty or subjugation of the town. Whoever controlled the walls of the city therefore also controlled its inhabitants. With these considerations in mind it is evident that the new towers reflected a powerful dual internal and external projection of strength. <ref type="bibr">449</ref> Most scholars consider the layout of the towers uniform, largely basing their observations on the structurally similar Towers X, XI and XII. This is hardly surprising since this portion of the wall remained visible after its first excavation while others were re-buried over time. Curiously, Mazois combined the three north towers for his generic reconstruction but actually depicted the ruins of Tower VII, with much of its stucco still in place, as the most complete example. He noted a slight variation of the plan, but did not explain the left rear door of Tower VII directly opposing the right door on the other three, in essence changing the layout of the stairways connecting the floors. <ref type="bibr">450</ref> This circumstance remained unnoticed by all subsequent authors, including Overbeck and Mau, who used Mazois as their main source on the towers. Only Reinicke recognized a difference in the layout of the towers, but he limited himself to pointing out that Towers II and III are mirror images to X, XI, and XII. 451 More recently, the Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, points out the discrepancies of Mazois' work, urging the reader not to take his plans as fully accurate. And it rightly points out Reinicke's faults in reversing the plan to an exact mirror image. 452 449 Livy, 24.37.2. 450 Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1, plate XII fig. 4.

In my opinion Mazois, rendered Tower VII as he also depicts names carved in the wall section between the tower</p><p>The main problem with the towers is that an accurate survey and plan of each structure is still lacking. Curiously, scholars have never fully noted the differences in the layout of the buildings, and a full survey of each tower is sorely needed. It is not the chance to protect themselves behind the shield they held in their left arm. This postern does the opposite and perhaps purposefully functioned as a re-entry point for sortie parties who could protect their left flank when approaching the tower. <ref type="bibr">453</ref> The type also features a slight variation in the decorative scheme; whereas the other towers, with the exception of VII, all display raised voussoirs defining the postern vaults, the openings of group two are flush with the masonry.</p><p>Group three includes Towers V, VI, and VII, where the access from the city side is on the left side and opens up directly onto the second floor; a staircase on the right leads down to the first-floor chamber (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_94">60</ref>). This type features the same corridor as group one winding behind the main chamber to the postern. The layout of the staircase heading down to the vaulted chamber, however, lowers the ceiling of the corridor and, as a result, cuts the arrow slit at its end in half, rendering it ineffective. The arrow slit seems almost decorative and put into place to give the tower the same external appearance as those in group one. Finally group four only includes Tower IX (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_44">10</ref>). The rear door opens in the middle of the back wall directly onto the ground floor and the ruins hold no trace of staircases, posterns, or windows. This version of the building, however, is a much later reconstruction and probably served as a storage area rather than a defensive structure. <ref type="bibr">454</ref> Despite the differences, the layouts of the various groups are essentially very similar, with variations in the positions of the rear doors, stair access, and placement of the posterns. The reasons for the differences are difficult to pinpoint, but most probably relate to the surrounding terrain and the outworks in front of them, which remain largely <ref type="bibr">453</ref> Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 44-45 comment on the lack of these posterns in the wall circuit at Pompeii, but Tower IV was buried at the time.

This seems especially the case, if we take into account that the types concentrate in specific areas of the circuit. The towers composing group one, for example, concentrate on the north side of the city, where the gently sloping terrain offers the easiest attack routes. Those in group two, with the exception of Tower VIII, are located on the low, steep lava ridge on the south side limiting the possibilities for direct attack, but still allowing defensive troops to mount sorties against the enemy. 455 Group three concentrates on the eastern side of the city, where the high and steep lava ridge likely diminished the necessity for short-range weapons on the lower floors. It is also possible that the divergent groups represent phased construction events, or the piecemeal replacement of earlier towers, but only future excavations can further elucidate this hypothesis.</p><p>Despite the internal plan variations the towers all appeared equal from a distance.</p><p>Their embellishments included a formulaic First-Style white decorative scheme featuring an elevated socle, imitation ashlar blocks, and a Doric frieze (figs. 36, 47, 61). This layout differs slightly from the traditional First-Style scheme featuring a socle, orthostates, and ashlars followed by a frieze. Originally some doubt existed about the coverage of the stucco on the towers. Some authors only recognized imitative ashlars on the tower flanks and smooth stucco on the façades, but the full recovery of Towers VIII and X ended the debate. 456 Anne Laidlaw describes the decorative remains in detail which need no repetition here. However, a few slight variations are evident. For example, the height of the socle on Tower VIII is slightly lower, suggesting perhaps a later <ref type="bibr">455</ref> The terrain in front of Tower VIII is largely unexcavated and entirely unknown.

Vitruvius notes that the strong proportions of the Doric order in particular reflect the martial strength of Mars, Minerva, and Hercules. He specifically recommends the use of the style on temples dedicated to her. <ref type="bibr">459</ref> The presence of the Doric frieze on the towers may therefore also relate to Minerva's role as protectress of the fortifications and the city.</p><p>This religious aspect also reflected the benevolence of those who financed the construction of the fortifications to protect the community and their relationship with the goddess. Beyond military and religious considerations, it is clear that both towers and gates received nonmilitary and purely aesthetic decorative ensembles as a reflection of the city they enclosed. The new white towers acted as landmarks in effect marking the city and its territory for many miles around. The decoration of the gates and the towers complemented each other, further highlighting the transition between town and country.</p><p>As in the previous phases, the architecture of the fortifications finds resonance in the city creating a direct connection with the ambitions of its citizens. <ref type="bibr">457</ref> See p. 138 ff.</p><p>458 A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RECALIBRATING THE IMAGE OF THE CITY</head><p>After the end of the Second Punic War and the neutralization of Carthage, Pompeii tapped into the new Roman trade routes with the east. The city was still nominally independent from Rome and the Samnite elite controlled much of the export and centralized landownership. Slaves increasingly worked the land, producing a massive influx of population from the countryside into the city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">460</ref> This shift would eventually cause the stresses leading to the crisis of the Social War and the implantation of a Sullan colony in Pompeii. The city also participated in Rome's conquest of the east.

The use of tufa is nevertheless curious considering the extensive remains of the limestone curtain in the nearby Porta Marina.</p><p>connection between the walls, a protective goddess of the city, and one of Pompeii's most ambitious architectural projects. The development of the sanctuary, therefore, also acted as massive political statement. It implicitly legitimized the power of the Pompeian elite by emphasizing their relationship with the deities protecting the city, and their role as protectors of the community through the construction of the fortifications. The choice of using tufa in particular resonated with elite housing and the image of the city to further underscore the message.</p><p>The construction materials used throughout Pompeii are the very same tufa and opus incertum employed on the city walls. Tufa is a relatively soft stone, easy to quarry and sculpt. Its compact character also allows it to be dressed to a uniform smoothness which is ideal for the application of stucco veneers imitating marble. These qualities led to its use as a building material from the late third century BCE up to the final days of the city. <ref type="bibr">467</ref> In this context the city walls very much formed a laboratory for tufa construction at Pompeii, since it is here that architects first used the material on a large scale. More versatile than limestone, tufa soon became a prestige material surpassed only by marble introduced during the Imperial period. In fact, builders used it primarily in highly visible places such as colonnades, stylobates, façades, and impluvium linings, for viewers to admire and patrons to flaunt. The exact quarries that fed the construction of the fortifications are still unknown, but miners extracted the stone from areas on the Sorrento peninsula, the Monti Lattari, and the neighboring town of Nocera, and transported it to town by ship, river barge, and carts. <ref type="bibr">468</ref> The diversity of the quarries used explains the brown to grey color range of the tufa employed throughout the city, but the fortifications tend to present a consistent grey/brown type indicating its origin from a common location. Opus incertum gained popularity in the middle of the second century BCE, and some of the less opulent houses used it for their façades and main building material. The hypothesis that the First-Style embodied pietas is certainly interesting, but it remains debatable since the notion seems to be more a code of conduct rather than an implicit ideal. <ref type="bibr">475</ref> However, the connection between the First-Style and its presence on the Pompeian fortifications merits further discussion. In particular the decorations on the exterior of the fortifications seem to connect to the aulic connotations of the style and project their part as a civic building protecting the settlement. It stressed their role in projecting a proper civic image, and legitimized the community they protected as a city.</p><p>The Style, therefore, also correlated to the euergetism of the commissioners as leaders of 473 V.J.</p><p>Bruno, "Antecedents of the Pompeian First Style" American Journal of Archaeology 73, no. 3 (July 1969): 305-308. 474 As suggested by S.T.A.M.

The buildings and their embellishments contributed to legitimize the elite's power, and were a statement marking the independence of the city. Furthermore, its connections to sacred architecture suggests that the Doric order present on the towers may allude to Minerva as one of the city's protective deities. This complex interaction ensured that the First-Style on the fortifications also signified the relationship between the individual commissioners, the state, and the gods each providing their own contribution to the safety and well-being of the community.</p><p>This interaction explains why the late-Republican magistrates dedicating city walls in Italy and the Roman West often did so as a symbolic act reflecting the (re-) foundation of the city, or its achievement of municipal or colonial status under Rome. <ref type="bibr">476</ref> As we shall see in the next chapter, the reconstruction of the Pompeian walls in the early colony is an example of this process. For these reasons fortifications eventually became the object of Imperial patronage under the Augustan program of civic renewal in Italy and the Roman west as a reflection of the new order. The process eventually culminated in the endowments of the great city gates of the Antonine age and thereafter at Attaleia, Timgad, and Bizya, to name a few examples. <ref type="bibr">477</ref> In this context they also symbolized the protection and benevolence of the emperor and the state toward the community, and its reciprocal allegiance with Rome.</p><p>Beyond the connection between the First-Style and the city walls it is the tufa that created the strongest resonance between the fortifications and a distinct visual architectural image of the city. The rapid development of Pompeii included the large 476 E.

The wealthiest families built on a lavish scale and scholars often view their dwellings, sometimes spanning the area of a full city block, as emulating the opulent Hellenistic palaces of the east. A concentration of these buildings exists in Regio VI, whereas others scattered through the city invariably face the main connecting arteries (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_97">63</ref>). <ref type="bibr">479</ref> Tufa blocks feature prominently on the façades of the most opulent houses and they immediately establish a dramatic visual presence in the city. <ref type="bibr">480</ref> In the earliest examples the tufa ashlars display rather sober carvings with plain rustication. They eventually gave way to more elaborate carved pilasters and canonically proportioned entablatures with carved Corinthian and Doric capitals framing the doorways. <ref type="bibr">481</ref> This development suggests an element of competition amongst the home owners vying to flaunt their wealth on the exterior of their houses. <ref type="bibr">482</ref> The implication is <ref type="bibr">478</ref> See R.

The very expense incurred to build and carve the tufa probably led the owner to want it uncovered. This recognition lasted much further into the history of the city since many tombs outside of the Porta Nocera feature graffiti on the tufa, attesting to the absence of stucco on the masonry. Similarly the great tufa columns in the peristyle of the House of Pansa were only stuccoed over during the Imperial period, having been left naked since the time of its construction. <ref type="bibr">487</ref> Tufa therefore superseded the application of stucco on the facades of the most elite houses most likely because of a limited availability of marble, and the relative lesser intrinsic value of opus incertum. The result was a local civic image that married tufa as a prestige material with the concepts associated to proper civic representation associated with the First Style.</p><p>The extensive remains of tufa façades throughout the city actually push the concept of a unified civic image further. The via dell'Abbondanza particularly illustrates the point (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">64</ref>). Its western tract, running between the via Stabiana and the Forum, originally featured a coherent lining of tufa façades on both public and private buildings. <ref type="bibr">488</ref> A tufa gateway on the east side of the Forum announced the beginning of the road. Both Nissen and Wallace-Hadrill suggest that the unified architectural appearance functioned as a purposeful ceremonial background for religious processions between the Forum and the Doric Temple. <ref type="bibr">489</ref> More importantly, the layout reflects a conscious shaping of the architectural image of the city. It seems reasonable to assume <ref type="bibr">486</ref> As suggested in a private conversation with Prof. Clarke. See also the discussion further below concerning the application of the First-Style on the exterior of buildings. <ref type="bibr">487</ref> Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 175. <ref type="bibr">488</ref> The earthquake demolished much of the original masonry but enough remains, including the Stabian baths, to imagine the stateliness of the road. <ref type="bibr">489</ref> Wallace-Hadrill, Rome's Cultural Revolution, 133.  that this vision also translated to the city walls as the largest structure in the urban framework. Further examples line the via di Nola and the via degli Augustali to the north, suggesting that the idea of a civic image permeated further throughout the city. Also striking is the survival of these façades for the remainder of Pompeian history, despite extensive remodeling occurring inside the houses. The representational element is clear, and the exterior of the house also functioned as a statement promoting the owner's status. <ref type="bibr">490</ref> Interestingly the construction of tufa façades ceased abruptly after the Sullan conquest,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_128">foot_128</ref> and many of these houses remained the property of the old Samnite elite, suggesting the continuity of a strong local identity beyond the subsequent installation of the Roman colony.</p><p>Strikingly, in a similar fashion to the city walls, the façades sometimes rest on limestone foundations that occasionally still peek through the raised sidewalks. <ref type="bibr">492</ref> This circumstance is likely the result of the Vitruvian prescription noting the qualities of travertine as a foundation stone. It suggests that the limestone/tufa combination is actually a standard construction technique used throughout Pompeii. This observation argues in favor of two important points; it strengthens the case that the appearance of the fortifications is the result of the application of standard construction technique, and that the outer curtain is actually the result of a single construction event. We have already commented on the continued uncertainty concerning the construction phasing of the walls. Furthermore, without further excavations it remains unclear to what extent the limestone was visible on the house façades. But the use of the limestone/tufa technique on the fortifications is, in my opinion, so marked and exaggerated that it clearly also carried an intended aesthetic effect regardless of the individual phases assigned in the past. It essentially marked a strong local identity that reflected the ambitions of the community and the elite to define Pompeii as a proper city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSCRIBING THE WALLS</head><p>The surviving inscriptions of the golden age tell us that the construction of public buildings occurred at the hands of private individuals belonging to a few very select and powerful families.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Naming the Fortifications</head><p>With such strong architectural associations between the city and its walls, we return to the eituns inscriptions as valuable documents highlighting the relationship between the populace and the fortifications. Over the years the inscriptions have attracted much scholarly attention, and this is not the place to reinterpret or retranslate them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">503</ref> As mentioned above, the most commonly accepted interpretation is that they represent directions for Samnite troops sent to aid Pompeii during the Sullan siege. They get their name from the recurrent word eituns which loosely translates to milites or "foot soldiers" in Oscan. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">504</ref> The inscriptions contain some crucial bits of information; they implicitly mention tower numbers and gate names. Two inscriptions found on the façades of VI.2.1 and VI.6.3 direct toward Tower XII and the veru sarinu, or salt gate, as a sector commanded by Maras Adirius. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">505</ref> A third inscription, located on the House of the Faun (VI.12.1), points the way to Towers X and XI as a sector under the command of Titus This basic evidence suggests a series of wider elements at work. First and foremost, the counterclockwise numbering of the towers and division in sectors clearly indicates a strict military planning and organization. Pocetti assigns much more significance to this sequence that suggests a Roman influence on the organization of the defenses. The numbering started with Tower I at the tip of the Triangular Forum, where it also was one of the most visually defining buildings of the cityscape. The number of the building reflects its status as a landmark contributing to create a visual concept of the city. The counterclockwise numbering perhaps also alluded to a religious association as processions often proceeded in the same direction. <ref type="bibr">510</ref> This context connects the numbers to the direction of lustratio, or purification ceremonies, associated in this case with the act of tracing the sulcus primigenius at the founding of the city. <ref type="bibr">511</ref> It may also represent the annual lustratio urbis designed to purify the city and keep away evil spirits.

Here they further emphasized the counterclockwise direction as one approached the city.</p><p>Another key is that we catch a glimpse of the nomenclature with the names of the salt (sarinu) and urublanu gates, and a nickname mefira, loosely translated as "midway," connected to a tower. Originally identified with Tower VIII, new evidence now assigns the mefira name to Tower VII because of its placement at the median between the Porta Sarno and Nola. <ref type="bibr">513</ref> More importantly, this nickname highlights how the towers acted as familiar landmarks and a focus for navigation through the city. <ref type="bibr">514</ref> If we consider, as Chiaramonte Trerè suggests, that the original text of the inscription on Tower VIII and the eituns reflected their official number or name, then the towers carried both popular and official names. <ref type="bibr">515</ref> Both references correlate closely to the function of the towers; the official number or name refers to the civic and military definition of the building, whereas the other reflects their role as easily identifiable landmarks in the urban matrix.</p><p>512 W. Fowler, "Lustratio." In Anthropology and the Classics (New York, 1966), 183. <ref type="bibr">513</ref> Traditionally, Tower VIII has received the ancient nickname mefira, because of its location half-way between the so-called Porta Capua and the Porta Nola. See Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 26. After the recent excavation of Tower IX disproved the existence of the Porta Capua, Coarelli reassigned the mefira nickname to Tower VII. This is the tower half way between the Porta Sarno and the Porta Nola, at the end of a street he identifies as the via mefira. He posits that this road is the continuation of the via degli Augustali which is the mid-way road between the via dell'Abbondanza and the via di Nola. Coarelli, "Pompei.

Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society (New York, 2007), 34-45. 515 Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 30. With the gates the situation is slightly different since we do not fully understand whether the nomenclature is official or represents nicknames. The Porta Ercolano seems securely identified as the Salt Gate, or the veru sarinu, because the via Consolare passing through it probably led to a series of salt flats nearby. 516 We also have the name of the veru urublanu, identified variously as the Porta Nola, 517 Porta Sarno, 518 or the Porta Nocera. 519 This diversity of hypotheses is part of an intense debate on the gate names closely related to the eituns, the electoral programmata, and the identification of population groups associated with Pompeii. Scholars have identified a multitude of group names: the salinienses, urbulanenses, campanienses, forenses, dianenses, and the stabianenses, who either inhabited nearby settlements and territories known as pagi, 520 or lived inside the city where they occupied distinct neighborhoods or vici. 521 The individual gates then received these names according to the pagi their roads led to, or their neighboring vici. Another hypothesis argues that the gates actually named the vici, whereas the inhabitants of both the neighboring pagi and vici they connected composed 516 Originally Ribezzo identified the Porta Sarno with the veru sarinu. See F. Ribezzo, "La nuova eituns di Pompei." Rivista indo-greco-italica di filologia, lingua, antichità 1 (1917), 58. For the arguments identifying the veru sarinu with the Porta Ercolano, see Sogliano, "Porte, torri e vie di Pompei nell'epoca Sannitica," 162-164. 517 Sogliano, "Porte, torri e vie di Pompei nell'epoca Sannitica," 168. More recently see Coarelli, "Pompei. Il Foro, le elezioni, le circoscrizioni elettorali,"107. See also Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 33. 518 M.

Rendiconti dell'accademia di archeologia, lettere e belle arti, Napoli 17 (1937), 276. 519 Sakai, "Ve28 reconsidered," 9. 520 Ribezzo, for example, floated the idea that the urbulanenses came from the town of Urbula. He used ancient texts to argue that they abandoned it to settle in a pagus outside of Pompeii. The road to the pagus then gave the name to the gate. See Ribezzo, "La nuova eituns di Pompei," 55-63. More recently Pesando suggests that veru urublanu translates to 'gate to the urbs', the urbs and gate in this case being Pompeii and the Porta Nola. See also Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 33. 521 See G. Amodio, "Sui 'vici' e le circoscrizioni elettorali di Pompei." Athenaeum 84 (1996), 458-468. She revisits much of the scholarly controversy and suggests that the electoral colleges included both vici and pagi united in tribus.</p><p>the electoral groups. <ref type="bibr">522</ref> All of these hypotheses rest on shaky grounds. <ref type="bibr">523</ref> The pagi thesis, widely accepted in early scholarship, relies on a still uncertain regional topography. The vici theory, elaborated by Sgobbo, builds on Della Corte's controversial idea of correlating the electoral programmata on house exteriors with their owners. <ref type="bibr">524</ref> The vici thesis has received widespread acceptance. The most recent approach identifies five tribes responding to independent electoral colleges in Pompeii: the urbulanenses in Regio III and IX, the campanienses in Regio IV and V, the salinienses in Regio VI, and the forenses in the area around the Forum (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_99">65</ref>). The fifth remains unnamed, but probably occupied the area of Regio I and II. In this framework the gates acquire the following names; the Porta Nola as the veru urublanu (porta urbulana in Latin), Porta Vesuvio as porta campana, Porta Ercolano as veru sarinu (salienses in Latin) and the Porta Marina as the porta forensis. <ref type="bibr">525</ref> Most of these names are originally</p><p>Oscan and carried through into Latin, suggesting a remarkable continuity in the political organization of the city despite the implantation of the colony.</p><p>Regardless of the true nomenclature, the notion of naming gates according to the neighboring vici or pagi, or vice versa, suggests an intergroup identification with their respective structures. The question then naturally follows whether the city gates carried <ref type="bibr">522</ref> Castrén, Ordo populusque Pompeianus, 80-82. <ref type="bibr">523</ref> Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society 34-35. 524 M.

Sgobbo mapped the electoral notices set up by groups supporting individual candidates and assigned them to quarters in the city according to their concentrations. Sgobbo, "Un complesso di edifici sannitici e i quartieri di Pompei per la prima volta riconosciuti" 34. Both Eschebach and Amodio brilliantly summarize the further vicissitudes of the debate so we need not revise them here. Amodio in particular delivers a sharp critique of Della Corte's methods. See Amodio, "Sui 'vici' e le circoscrizioni elettorali di Pompei." 458-468. See also Eschebach and Eschebach, Pompeji vom 7. Jahrhundert v.Chr. bis 79 n.Chr 65-67, and more recently Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society, 34-39 who actually prefers to use the distribution of fountains to recognize neighborhoods. <ref type="bibr">525</ref> Coarelli further elaborates Sgobbo's thesis using the compital altars located on the main roads to mark the borders of the vici. He sees the division of Pompeii into five electoral regions, which relates to its name Oscan name 'pentapolis' or city of five. Coarelli, "Pompei.

The present evidence does not immediately point to any embellishments explicitly stressing such connections. Rather, if we take away the minor exceptions of the Porta Stabia and Ercolano, the gates show a remarkable diachronic unity in design, decoration, and layout, as do the towers. In many ways, therefore, the fortifications acted as a unifying architectural force encompassing the social plurality of Pompeii. The follow-up question is whether this is a reflection of a local Pompeian identity or a foreign influence-or both.</p></div>

He also mentions the presence of two aediles and a quaestor probably functioning on Roman models. Finally there was also a Senate, the kunparakin, and an assembly of free male citizens known as the kumbenni. See De Caro,"La città sannitica urbanistica e architettura," 32. This setup aligns with the early Samnite political organization where individual settlements, known as vici, were grouped into a regional pagus, or canton. Each pagus elected a meddix as a leader who in turn responded to the meddix tuticus. He headed a grouping of pagi organized along familial and tribal lines, known as touta.</p><p>See Cornell, "Warfare and Urbanization in Roman Italy," 124. responding to a very loose and weak federal league. 527 The debate here is important to us since the politics of a league of cities may have influenced the design and construction of fortifications. Loose alliances, such as the Etruscan dodecapoli, ensured a degree of mutual security against external threats. The agreements reached could involve the siting of settlements, warning systems, the construction of common fortification works, and mutual non-aggression pacts. Furthermore, a central political body could also manage the resources necessary to coordinate the simultaneous defense of several settlements, or conduct offensive operations. 528 Within our framework, the most important points of contact between Nocera and Pompeii come through in the astonishing similarities between their fortifications. The layout of Nocera is rectangular with heavy natural scarps defending the north, west, and eastern sides of the city. The southern side, as the most vulnerable section, received the heaviest fortifications and like Pompeii featured a tufa opus quadratum double wall with an agger in the back. Beyond our two centers, this design was fairly common throughout the region and displays strong similarities with other settlements such as Teano, Monte Santa Croce, and Saepinum. 529 This circumstance may be the result of a strong Samnite military tradition, or a widespread adoption of the most effective defensive architecture. At Nocera the defenses proved formidable enough that Hannibal reduced the city by starvation rather than direct attack and subsequently destroyed it in 216 BCE. 530 527 F.

The use of tufa and opus incertum, local construction materials to both Pompeii and Nocera, is hardly surprising as these were cheap and easily available. Given the similarities, it seems plausible to assume a common origin for the design and decoration of the structures at Pompeii and Nocera. Furthermore, the matching acroteria of the Basilica in Pompeii and the towers at Nocera may even reflect close political ties between the two settlements. 533 531 Johannowsky, "Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina," 123. Johannowsky points to two construction phases at Nocera. The last occurred shortly before or contemporaneously to Pompeii. His dating however rests on typological differences which, as at Pompeii, may respond to the local terrain. This is not the place to dive further into this complex issue, but a distinct possibility exists that all towers in both cities are built in the space of just a few years. 532 W.</p><p>Johannowsky, "Nuovi rinvenimenti a Nuceria Alfaterna."

See also Johannowsky "Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina,"123-131. 533 In particular, scholars traditionally date the construction of the Basilica to the last decades of the second century bce, making it roughly contemporary with the towers. As a building form this is a typically Roman edifice. Its presence in the city points to a strong Roman component to Pompeii. see Zanker "The City as The origins of the basic design and layout are more difficult to trace since the mechanisms of martial architectural transmission have not received much scholarly attention. Richardson proposes that the limestone and tufa enceintes at Pompeii are the product of a single design modeled on the Athenian walls of the fourth century BCE, but there is little further evidence to support this theory. 534 The Servian Wall in Rome is an example of the complexity of the issue. Built using tufa opus quadratum in the first quarter of the fourth century BCE, engineers exploited the natural topography and built an agger in the weak areas to maximize the wall's strength. In concept, therefore, the fortifications in Rome foreshadowed the Pompeian design. In the early 1930s Gӧsta Säflund conducted an intensive study of the remains. Based on the similarity of quarry marks and block sizes, he concluded that the Servian Wall borrowed heavily from Syracusan architects and construction techniques. 535 In fact, a recent investigation on the section of walls preserved near the modern Termini railway station in Rome reveals construction seams roughly a plethorn measure apart indicating a similar organization of construction crews mentioned by Diodorus Siculus for the Epiploae fortifications. 536 The two cities shared Carthage as an enemy, a circumstance, Säflund believed, that led to their close collaboration as allies.

He likely learned how to build them from his encounters with Carthaginians armies who had been exposed to advanced siege tactics in Symbol: Rome and the Creation of an Urban Image," 126-40; more specifically for Pompeii see Zanker Pompeii.

Other striking similarities reside in the employment of the Achaean Greek alphabet for the quarry marks and the use of the two attic feet in the measurement of the blocks.

Curiously, Bonucci believes that the inscribed characters were there not only for construction purposes, but also served an apotropaic function. This theory, however, has not received any further attention. See C. Bonucci, Pompéi (Naples, 1830), 81-82. 539 See F. Frigerio, La cerchia di Novum Comum.

The extent of the renovations is therefore difficult to assess. <ref type="bibr">556</ref> As mentioned previously, whether by full demolition or the removal of battlements, the demilitarization of city walls was a common punishment to prohibit their effective re-use, prevent renewed uprisings, and dismiss any form of civic independence or bargaining power. 557 Such measures are not immediately evident for Pompeii, although, as we have seen, a recent tenuous theory points out that the presence of drainage spouts in the opus incertum is the result of the reorganization of the battlements. <ref type="bibr">558</ref> A further complicating factor is the obscurity of the happenings throughout the siege.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Evidence from the Curtain Wall</head><p>The primary evidence is again difficult to analyze as much of the surviving masonry is completely bare, although some sort of stucco coating usually accompanied the application of opus incertum. Furthermore, the parapet has also largely disappeared, complicating the interpretation of the appearance of the walls. Two sections of opus incertum stretch on either side of the Porta Stabia (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_102">69</ref>). West of the entrance a tract of opus incertum masonry quickly gives way to an entirely demolished area of the defenses likely looted in the post-earthquake period. To the east, the relic of an earlier internal Sarno limestone pier interrupts an otherwise uniform sixty-meter stretch of opus incertum masonry. The pier corresponds to a slight reentrant in the curtain and the eastern enclosure wall of the schola Tomb of Marcus Tullius. <ref type="bibr">560</ref> The masonry adjacent to the gate is slightly rougher and it may represent a refurbishment or a partial demolition of the wall face carried out with the tomb construction. <ref type="bibr">561</ref> At its very bottom the wall displays a well finished surface that likely accommodated a now lost stucco veneer. East of the pier the masonry includes clear horizontal construction seams marking the sequential deposition of the concrete during the construction process. The parapet has completely disappeared, including any spouts that drained rainwater from the wall-walk. 562 560 As a prominent member of society, Marcus Tullius was probably responsible for the construction of the Temple of Fortuna Augusta. <ref type="bibr">See Mau,</ref><ref type="bibr">Pompei: its Life and Art,</ref><ref type="bibr">422.

Maiuri believed it was pre-Sullan and identified some early Imperial repairs to strengthen the wall against the agger behind it. <ref type="bibr">563</ref> Today modern imitation masonry composes much of the stretch and only the last ten meters leading up to Tower V are partially original. <ref type="bibr">564</ref> They display the remains of a plaster base coat that suggest a now lost embellishment. A couple of images from</p><p>Maiuri's excavations around the amphitheater in the late 1950s confirm this layout. They show a low wall before its reconstruction and the ancient masonry is clearly visible next to the tower. Although Maiuri believed otherwise, the surviving ancient opus incertum masonry most likely relates to the construction of the amphitheater, but the current evidence does not allow any further elaboration on the matter.</p><p>Only two known large tracts of opus incertum survive between the amphitheater and the Porta Vesuvio. The eastern bastion of the Porta Nola is perhaps one of the most imposing stretches. It still towers above anyone passing through the gate (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_104">71</ref>). A subsequent lowering of the road in the Augustan period, carried out to ease access into the city, revealed its foundations and added to the formidable impression of the gate. <ref type="bibr">565</ref> Scant remains of a stucco base coat survive, but too little remains for any further assessment. <ref type="bibr">566</ref> Further west recent excavations have re-exposed a section of opus incertum associated with Tower IX (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_44">10</ref>). The results confirm its post-colonial date and project its original height to some six meters, of which only some three remain. <ref type="bibr">567</ref> Interestingly, four counterforts rather than an agger strengthened the wall.

None display traces of a decorative scheme, but they do present a more intact parapet. A small section stretching twenty-five meters east from Tower XI features seven regularly spaced drainage spouts and a unique decorative masonry architrave supporting a continuous battlement. A smaller ten-meter patch of masonry also survives roughly twenty-two meters from Tower XI but it is less well preserved. To the west, an extensive section of masonry starts some fifteen meters east of Tower XII and covers most of the ground toward Porta Ercolano (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_105">72</ref>). Limestone blocks compose the parapet east of the tower and tufa spouts sit lower down encased in the masonry. <ref type="bibr">569</ref> West of the tower the parapet transitions into a series of vertical tufa blocks standing on a horizontal architrave. Below it nineteen regularly spaced drainage spouts survive set into the masonry. A vertical seam in the wall façade further marks the transition, and it may represent successive construction events or the work of differing construction crews. <ref type="bibr">570</ref> The wall face displays clear horizontal construction seams recently dated to the Roman colony. They are strikingly similar to those found east of the Porta Stabia. Patches of rubble fill throughout the section point to secondary emergency repairs that most likely date to the post-earthquake period. <ref type="bibr">571</ref> On the city side of the agger construction of a new 568 H.

The first creates a terrace for the vicolo dei Soprastanti and is incorporated into the later expansion of the House of Umbricus Scaurus (VII.16.15) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_55">21</ref>). Its southern edge displays the same spouts and tufa parapet as the curtain east of the Porta Ercolano. A large patch of fired brickwork at its base suggests similar post-earthquake repairs. A recent hypothesis posits that a colonist acquired the house immediately after the installation of the colony.</p><p>The new owner demolished the previous limestone curtain and substituted it with the current opus incertum wall as part of an effort to build rooms on the new lower terrace. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">573</ref> Perhaps as an implicit statement of conquest, or as a cost saving measure, he reused much of the limestone masonry as a building material for the refurbishments in the house. <ref type="bibr">574</ref> South of the Porta Marina opus incertum superimposed on a few older Sarno limestone courses acts as a terrace for the Temple of Venus (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_56">22</ref>). A lonely block of tufa suggests that it replaced an earlier limestone/tufa curtain. The so-called Villa Imperiale (VIII.1.a) enveloped this section of the fortifications in the late first century BCE, covering them with Third-Style frescos and burying the external pomerial road. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">575</ref> East of the temple another large section of fortifications emerges from remains of later buildings (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_106">73</ref>). It includes encased drainage spouts and the remains of a tufa parapet similar to the wall east of the Porta Ercolano. The section displays signs of later re-use;</p><p>the tufa blocks are sheared off and modified to support floor beams, and a terracotta sewer cut into the masonry at a later date drained excess water from the gardens above.</p><p>Smooth white plaster and a surviving patch of embedded amphora pieces that likely functioned as a foundation for a stucco veneer still cover the masonry. It is unclear whether they are part of the original wall decoration or later buildings. <ref type="bibr">576</ref> Finally, a stretch of opus incertum, perhaps related to the construction of the yet unlocated Tower I, partially replaces the limestone terrace of the Doric Temple, but no parapet or drainage system survives.</p><p>With a few exceptions, the reconstruction effort largely preserved the layout of the battlements and agger system of the fortifications. The presence of drainage spouts in the opus incertum is a case in point since they probably are re-used elements of the tufa curtain. Along with the tufa parapet and the consistent horizontal seams, their very recurrence in the largest sections of masonry suggests that these curtain tracts belong to a single construction effort. Interesting to note, however, is the substantially lower level of the spouts below the continuous parapet east of Tower XI. This situation is probably the result of the unique battlement requiring a different drainage system, and may relate to a different construction event. A more important question is how the opus incertum matched up with the previous ashlar circuit since efforts to integrate or explicitly differentiate the masonry may represent implicit political statements. As far as any sort of stucco embellishment is concerned the analysis above points out that the current remains, besides a few scant traces, offer little to work with.</p><p>576 Similarly, a door cut into the nearby limestone masonry probably offered access from the House of Championnet II (VIII.2.3) above.</p><p>In an effort to reconstruct the appearance of the walls the individual wall descriptions and engravings of the earliest publications on Pompeii again offer some solace. We should keep in mind that these publications are part of an era that had far less detailed scientific standards than our modern age, and give us divergent pictures of the surviving remains. Several authors implicitly state that a stucco veneer covered the opus incertum curtain wall sections, but none mention whether it was smooth or replicated ashlar masonry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">577</ref> For example, William Gell describes the stucco as deliberately imitating the opus quadratum masonry, but it is unclear whether he refers to the towers, the curtain, or both. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">578</ref> Thomas Dyer, referencing Gell, is equally vague describing the opus incertum sections as covered in stucco to better fit in with the adjacent masonry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">579</ref> Johannes Overbeck is somewhat more specific describing sporadic remains of stucco still covering the opus incertum masonry in the middle of the nineteenth century. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">580</ref> Illustrations scattered throughout early publications offer further conflicting views. These are sometimes simple vignettes, and more often prints of engravings derived from field drawings that may have lost some detail in the copying process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">581</ref> Most depict the exposed northern part of the fortifications from various angles, but only a handful seems accurate. Gell furnishes two drawings; the first depicting the section between Tower XI and the Porta Ercolano, and the second a close-up of Tower XII (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_107">74</ref>). Both show the lower sections of the curtain completely covered in a smooth stucco coating following the horizontal seams in the masonry. The accuracy is somewhat on the surface. <ref type="bibr">587</ref> Mazois in particular also details the presence of a secondary coat of stucco, suggesting a refurbishment of the decorative scheme (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_109">76</ref>).</p><p>Recently Russo and Russo hypothesize the presence of a First-Style veneer on the entire post-Sullan circuit. Their theory relies on a study of the pockmarks created by the Sullan war machine on the wall sections on the north side of the city. Along with a handful of less clear examples, a hole in the fifth block on the exterior western corner of the Porta Vesuvio contains a plaster plug that is their primary evidence for a decorative stucco coating. If true, the theory solves both military and aesthetic issues; the stucco presented a uniform façade to onlookers and masked divergent, perhaps weaker, masonry. However, the problems with this theory are many, not least the complete absence of substantial stucco remains on the opus quadratum including the early illustrations examined above. <ref type="bibr">588</ref> Furthermore, the towers provide ample evidence that, under the right conditions, large tracts of the stucco coating may have survived intact.</p><p>Even so, the authors dismiss the missing plaster as the result of its complete disintegration after its excavation. <ref type="bibr">589</ref> Otherwise lacking on the rest of the circuit, the stucco plugs may therefore represent patches preventing the scaling of the fortifications by both individuals and enemy troops. <ref type="bibr">590</ref> Roman law indicates just how much such an illegal scaling was undesirable whether to keep out thieves or contrabandists trying to avoid the policing 587 L.

Gell, Pompeiana, Pl. XV. Gell also describes a piece of cornice on the ground before the north bastion of the gate as part of a decorative feature that collapsed from the parapet above, but no further evidence exists to place it there. See also Breton, Pompeia décrite et dessinée, 240. 588 Russo and Russo, 89 a.C.: Assedio a Pompei, 71-75. <ref type="bibr">589</ref> The only plaster surviving on the opus quadratum is on the western bastion of the Porta Vesuvio. Here it remains stuck behind an arch jamb built in the post-earthquake period of the city. The niche of the Porta Stabia also still carry stucco. In both cases the embellishments are limited to the shrines rather than covering the entire masonry. <ref type="bibr">590</ref> As suggested by Prof. R. Taylor in a private conversation.</p><p>function of gates. City walls constituted a special category known as res sanctae, or holy things, protected by, but not consecrated to, the gods. Scaling or crossing them illegally was a sacrilege punishable by death. <ref type="bibr">591</ref> Their status was probably related to the sulcus primigenius ritual since fortifications often closely shadowed the line of the pomerium in early colonial foundations. We have already noted the strong religious element associated with the Pompeian fortifications, and the new status of the city as a colony perhaps led to the strict enforcement of this law.</p><p>Whether plain or imitating ashlar masonry, the evidence points to some sort of stucco coating originally covering the opus incertum in the curtain wall, however elusive it might be to us. In many ways it formed a dramatic contrast with the opus quadratum of the previous circuit, and created a discrepancy in the visual unity of the wall. Perhaps the reasons for its presence are merely practical. After all, opus incertum was now the cheapest and fastest building material, and the stucco may represent nothing more than a coat meant to protect the masonry from the elements. Nevertheless, the stucco clearly resonated and probably functioned in unison with the decorative embellishments present on the towers and gate vaults. The new sections clearly announced and readily identified the euergetism of those involved in the reconstruction of the walls and by extension the new social order in the city.</p><p>This hypothesis seems particularly apt if we consider two key aspects: the associations of the First Style as applied on the exterior of buildings with the proper image of public structures; and the identity of Loreius and Cuspius, the two duumviri responsible for refurbishing the walls, as Roman colonists. In this context it is no 591 Digest 1.8.1-9 Gaius, Institues, book 1, in A. Watson, ed. The Digest of Justinian. (Philadelphia,  1985). .

As highlighted further below, these two goddesses played instrumental roles in the identity of the city. The masonry in such a prominent location undoubtedly carried a stucco embellishment and, as is true for the previous phases, created a powerful renewed connection between the walls, the deities protecting the city, and the sponsors of the reconstruction effort.</p><p>Beyond their initial refurbishment, the curtain sections remained substantially unchanged until the earthquake of 62 CE. As emphasized further below, the area of public land associated with the walls continued to slowly shrink, overtaken by construction and accommodating burials. The walls slowly changed roles from an effective defensive line to a barrier with a diminished military function. After the earthquake the population used many areas in front of the curtain as dumps for the architectural debris resulting from the cleanup efforts. <ref type="bibr">592</ref> Most notably, large tracts adjacent to the Porta Stabia, Nocera, and Nola became open-air quarries spoliated for building material in the ensuing reconstruction. <ref type="bibr">593</ref> Although they lost much of their imposing appearance, the walls contributed immensely both psychologically and physically to the rebirth of the city. They acted as functional markers beyond which the population placed the ruins of the devastated city, and simultaneously provided the necessary material to contribute to its reconstruction. <ref type="bibr">592</ref> Maiuri, "Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano," 279-280.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Porta Marina</head><p>Beyond the various tracts of the walls, a few gates received structural makeovers in the period between the installation of the Roman colony and the eruption of Vesuvius.</p><p>Some carry the signs of multiple interventions, but it is hard to ascertain when they occurred. The Porta Marina is a case in point (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_110">77</ref>). It lies on the western edge of the Pompeian plateau forming a primary link between the coast and the Forum. Its backbone is a large barrel-vaulted corridor built in opus quasi-reticulatum and brick quoins set inside the limestone masonry of the first Samnite enceinte. Two vaulted entryways extend in front of it; a smaller passage for pedestrians, and a large entrance reserved for pack animals and horses since the road through the gate was too steep for cart traffic. A limestone bastion extends forward on the southern side and contains a niche where excavators recovered a broken terracotta statue of Minerva. The corridor features a walled up door on the north side and another still opens to an unidentified space on the south side. <ref type="bibr">594</ref> On the city side a large opus incertum terrace, built at a later date to support a portico heading to the houses above the gate, abruptly cuts off the sidewalk, forcing would-be pedestrians onto the flagstones. <ref type="bibr">595</ref> The Porta Marina has received a lot of scholarly attention concerning its date and construction sequence. <ref type="bibr">596</ref> The current communis opinio identifies the barrel vault as a modification built in the early years of the colony and the smaller outer vaults as added soon thereafter.

Little noticed in Pompeian scholarship are the marble chips inserted in between the flagstones. They are unique in the city and serve to highlight the stateliness and importance of the road. Furthermore, the Temple of Venus in particular received new decorations as an explicit political statement in her role as the personal protectress of Sulla and her transformation from the Samnite Mefitis Fisica. <ref type="bibr">601</ref> Outside the walls the road led to the navalia, a series of harbor facilities built soon after the installation of the colony, where Roman navy ships docked on land at night and during the winter.

The establishment of the colony brought with it the expectation to meet the proper Roman living standards that included a supply of flowing fresh water. <ref type="bibr">611</ref> As the highest point in the city, the Porta Vesuvio lent itself naturally to the task; its status as a public structure obviated the necessity of costly expropriations.

The waterworks in this location created a deliberate visual statement announcing the arrival of the aqueduct into the city. A new wide plaza in front of it further stressed its presence to onlookers. The works necessary to build the castellum were substantial. They included the shortening of the western gate court by some 6.5 meters, the complete demolishing of its internal wall, and the construction of a new terrace to hold back the agger. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">615</ref> The new waterworks also affected the street network of the area. It closed the access to the pomerial road running at the base of agger, whereas the aqueduct channel approached the city slightly above ground, essentially cutting off the exterior route to the Porta Ercolano. In an effort to re-establish the connection, engineers raised the entire area between the two gates with a massive two-meter deep earth fill and built a road overtopping the aqueduct. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">616</ref> Construction of the channel through the fortifications posed further challenges. Workers had to negotiate the masonry of the curtain and the buried bastion adjacent to the gate. Ohlig envisions the removal and later reconstruction of the masonry to reach the level of the channel, but the outer curtain preserves no trace of this event unless workers carefully put back every single block in place. This scenario is certainly possible if we consider a deliberate desire to preserve the effect of the tufa/limestone façade of the outer curtain, but it seems unlikely; tunneling through the agger was probably a more practical solution.</p><p>The overall consequences on the fortifications were dramatic. The external fill reduced their relative height, buried the tower posterns, and eliminated any outworks immediately in front of the walls (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_73">39</ref>, 72). Both Maiuri and Ohlig believe that these events were only possible after the walls had ceased to function militarily. <ref type="bibr">617</ref> Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that the decision to locate the castellum within the fortified perimeter, and the burial of the channel, imply a distinct desire to keep them out of reach and maintain the protective role of the fortifications despite their weakening. If we follow Ohlig's suggestion, the new complex also carried an implicit colonial statement; the partially demolished gate also symbolized lost independence and framed the new, distinctly Roman waterworks. Furthermore, the exterior earthwork also cancelled out the limestone/tufa juxtaposition of the curtain, a hallmark of Samnite</p><p>Pompeii, in one of the most visible and powerful areas of the fortifications. This message seems particularly poignant assuming that funding for the aqueduct originated in Rome as part of the foundation of the colony. 618 617 Maiuri, "Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano," 277-279, Ohlig "Städtebauliche Veränderungen im Bereich des Pomeriums und der Porta Vesuvio," 93-102. <ref type="bibr">618</ref> Ohlig, "Städtebauliche Veränderungen im Bereich des Pomeriums und der Porta Vesuvio," 104.</p><p>colony, but a recent re-evaluation suggests that it was begun before the siege. <ref type="bibr">621</ref> In this context we may suggest that the gate vault perhaps accompanied and/or celebrated its completion in the early years of the colony. In the Augustan period, or soon thereafter, a raised causeway built in front of the gate eased passage into the city from the bustling river port nearby. The inscription mentioned previously commemorating how the duumviri L. Avianius Flaccus, and Q. Spedius Firmus renovated the road likely also refers to the construction of the causeway. <ref type="bibr">622</ref> The new roadway also bridged the defensive ditch in front of the gate, thereby significantly reducing its military effectiveness. It also compromised the natural drainage of rainwater through the passageway, leading to the construction of a sewer through the western agger that demolished the stairs leading up to the wall walk. 623</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Augustan Gates</head><p>A few other gates experienced a similar change in the same period; the roads through the Porta Nola, Nocera, and Marina were lowered, and the Porta Ercolano and Vesuvio elevated. <ref type="bibr">624</ref> In practical terms these road works eased the passage into the city, and scholars associate these modifications with a general reduction of defensive concerns</p><p>621 See Wallace-Hadrill, Rome's Cultural Revolution, 131 on the construction of the small theater. 622 CIL X, 1064. See also Maiuri, "Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei," 198. The date is somewhat uncertain. Castrén sees them in office in the early Julio-Claudian period. Castrén, Ordo Populusque Pompeianus, 141, 223. The new causeway may coincide with the closure of the pomerial road leading to the Porta Marina. A Claudian sestertius found beneath the paving stones below the vault points to a later date, but it may relate to a re-paving of the road. See G. Spano, "Pompei." Notizie degli scavi di antichità 19 (1911): 377. 623 Recent excavations of the drain put its construction date to very late in the colony on the basis of wear pattern of the nearby fountain. See S.J.R. Ellis and G. Devore, "Two Seasons of Excavations at VIII.7.1-15 and the Porta Stabia at Pompeii, 2005 -2006." Rivista di studi pompeiani 18 (2007): 124-125. It is possible, however, that this fountain associates with the construction of the Avella aqueduct. 624 At the Porta Marina and Nocera the works also led to a similar blockage of the sewers passing through the agger. For the Porta Vesuvio see Seiler et.al "La regio VI insula 16 e la zona della Porta Vesuvio," 252.</p><p>resulting from the establishment of the pax augusta. <ref type="bibr">625</ref> We shall discuss the role of the fortifications in this period further below, but we may note that Augustus promoted the construction of many enceintes and gates as part of his program of civic renewal on the Italian peninsula. At Pompeii the early Imperial period saw the construction of many politically inspired buildings as the Pompeian elite aligned itself with the new realities of power. <ref type="bibr">626</ref> In particular, the Eumachia building, the Temple to the Genius of Augustus, the shrine to the public lares on the east side of the Forum, and the private Temple to Fortuna</p><p>Augusta farther north all celebrated the emperor and his cult. <ref type="bibr">627</ref> The changes to the roadways may seem subtle, but they included radical interventions: cutting back scarps, filling in defensive ditches, and the re-paving of roads. The result was a new emphasis on the gates of Pompeii. This seems especially the case where the lowered roadways added to the height of the gates and walls as one passed through the agger. The tall walls compounded the cavernous effect of the passageways already inherent in the design of forecourt gates, thereby enhancing their stateliness and the experience of passing through the limits of the city (figs. 43 and 71). If anything, although the martial function of the fortifications decreased, these modifications on the gates followed the wider urbanization processes occurring on the peninsula. <ref type="bibr">625</ref> Maiuri, "Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei," 219 and also Guzzo, Pompei.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Post-Earthquake Interventions on the Porta Ercolano and Porta Vesuvio</head><p>After these events the gates remained largely untouched until the effects of the 62 CE earthquake prompted a radical intervention on the Porta Ercolano. 628 This is a remarkable circumstance considering the heavy damage wrought on the area during the siege. Presumably, the gate needed some sort of repairs after the siege, but its scars were likely still present on the masonry as they are on the adjacent curtain wall today. They acted as visual reminder of the attack and conquest of the city, a message perhaps reinforced by the partial burial and reconstruction of the wall toward Porta Vesuvio.</p><p>Excavated in the 1760's, and therefore on modern view for several centuries, First Style. <ref type="bibr">630</ref> Drawings published in the volumes of Gell and Overbeck-Mau illustrate two Ionic marble columns framing the exterior of the eastern pedestrian entrance, but their presence at the time was the result of an erroneous reconstruction using pieces from a nearby tomb. <ref type="bibr">631</ref> In similar fashion to the other city gates, the stucco was otherwise a plain white and functioned as an album containing graffiti, city ordinances, and announcements of gladiatorial games. Successive paint coats cleared the clutter, attesting to both the careful maintenance of the gate's appearance and its performance as a billboard in the city. 632</p><p>William Gell also published a reconstruction of the gate, a task that few others have attempted ever since. The author himself admits the rather speculative nature of the reconstruction and he projects the gate as a full-fledged Roman triumphal arch crowned with a great biga. <ref type="bibr">633</ref> Subsequent reconstructions varied the theme only slightly. Niccolini lowered the height of the two pedestrian entrances, whereas Delaunay published a more reserved version without the crowning biga (figs. 82 and 83). <ref type="bibr">634</ref> These somewhat overzealous reconstructions clash with the physical remains. For example, Gell reconstructs full double parapets on either side of the gate, but an inn and stable flanked the gate's southern side, and a staircase rather than the internal parapet abutted it to the north.

A word of caution on the accuracy of Delaunay, however, since he describes the side entrances on one of the towers as being the Porta Stabia, 12.</p><p>recently, Brands points out the parallels between the Porta Ercolano and the Augustan cavaedium gate types at Fano, Torino, and Spello. <ref type="bibr">635</ref> These grand gates featured a similar open central court and the Porta Ercolano resembled their core passageway without the flanking towers.</p><p>Scholars have questioned the nature of the gate and whether its function was primarily ornamental, defensive, or both. <ref type="bibr">636</ref> Open court gates have a clear military function to trap attackers and allow their bombardment from above. Yet the current remains preclude an easy access to the second floor except for an approach from the north. Although the gate resembled the design of the open court types, it likely did not achieve a full military functionality. The specifics of the scholarly debate need not concern us here since its monumental character is evident. In many ways it embodies the post-earthquake reconstruction effort. Its stucco embellishments fit into a roughly 180year old decorative tradition on the fortifications reflecting the proper image of the city that in the post-earthquake period simultaneously referenced its resilience and history.</p><p>The choice of rebuilding the Porta Ercolano is also no coincidence since it straddled one of the most important routes of the city, connecting it directly with Rome. As noted previously, this circumstance likely led to the construction of the well-finished adjacent opus quadratum tufa masonry.

Scholars have also focused their attention on the closing mechanisms and weather both interior and exterior entrances featured gates. The exterior entrances have no further evidence of closing mechanisms except for grooves intended to accommodate a portcullis shuttering over the main road. The presence of stucco in the rails, however, induced many to believe that the portcullis was never installed since it would have ruined the delicate coat when it opened or closed. See F.</p><p>Niccolini and F. Niccolini, Le case ed i monumenti di Pompei. vol. 2 (Naples 1862), 9. Also, Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 55. Monnier in particular sees the absent portcullis as a deliberate ploy to draw in attackers and trap them see Monnier, Pompéi et les pompéiens, 101. See also M. Monnier, The Wonders of Pompeii (New York, 1870), 96. In any event, the gate closed on the interior and could still function to keep unwanted elements from entering the perimeter of the walls.</p><p>elite tombs, and a concentration of elite houses in Regio VI all lined the road, indicating that it retained its status as a prominent thoroughfare in the city. <ref type="bibr">637</ref> A new gate was also in the works at the Porta Vesuvio when the eruption occurred. Largely demolished in the earthquake of 62 CE, its new plan featured an elaborate double arch similar to the Porta Marina (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">14</ref>). Unlike its earlier counterpart, where a terrace eventually shut off the pedestrian sidewalk, the Porta Vesuvio already included a blind sidewalk dead-ending on the old limestone bastion. As mentioned previously, this space preserved a lararium at the time of excavation and the new arch further monumentalized the shrine, suggesting a concern with the aesthetic effects and religious connotations of the gate. The similarity with the Porta Marina is hard to dismiss and, like the Porta Ercolano, points to a continued unified conceptual presentation of the fortifications and the city. A recent hypothesis even proposes that the final design of the Vesuvian gate was a carbon copy of the Porta Ercolano. <ref type="bibr">638</ref> Although within the realm of possibilities, this theory remains hard to prove. Regardless of its final monumental appearance the reconstruction effort carried the same message.</p><p>After the devastating seismic events of 62 CE, the area between the two gates became symbolic of the reconstruction effort since it received the greatest mass of architectural debris associated with the clean-up of the city. <ref type="bibr">639</ref> The reconstruction of the two gates therefore carried a further message of rebirth. This statement connected back to <ref type="bibr">637</ref> See F. Senatore, "Necropoli e società nell'antica Pompei. Considerazioni su un sepolcreto di poveri." In Pompei, il Vesuvio e la penisola Sorrentina (Rome, 1999), 95. The Porta Ercolano necropolis seems to cater more to the rich where 48% of the tombs represent the elite, as opposed to the 20% of the Porta Nocera. The Porta Ercolano perhaps primarily served Regio VI where there seems to be a higher concentration of opulent houses. On the importance of key roads see Zanker, "The City as Symbol: Rome and the Creation of an Urban Image," 25-41. <ref type="bibr">638</ref> On the matter see Frӧlich, "La porta di Ercolano a Pompei e la cronologia dell'opus vittatum mixtum," 151. <ref type="bibr">639</ref> Maiuri, "Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano," 278-280, describes large piles up to 1,60m deep outside these two gates.</p><p>Colonia Augusta Ariminensis. <ref type="bibr">644</ref> The new Porta Ercolano probably carried similar messages, creating an interregional connection with Rome through its position on the via Consolare and celebrating the benevolence of the emperor financing the reconstruction effort. The message was clear: no other buildings could symbolize the rebirth of the city more effectively than renewal of the markers on its boundaries.</p><p>Considering the important developments concerning the gates a few more remarks concerning their function in the city are in order. As mentioned, city gates played an important role as tax barriers. As a result they also carried strong associations with the political and legal authority of the city. Starting in the first century BCE scholars trace a distinct evolution in gate design that included multiple passageways to relieve the traffic congestion that resulted from their role as bottlenecks. This trend continued with the advent of the pax romana under the empire. <ref type="bibr">645</ref> Although gates retained a defensive role, this development signals a shift in emphasis toward more practical and monumental considerations in gate design. In fact, monumental gates designed with less emphasis on defense also symbolized the wider protection offered by the emperor and the empire, along with their celebration of local civic identity. <ref type="bibr">646</ref> As Cornelis van Tilburg recently points out, the exponential development of Pompeii in the Samnite period probably compounded the issues of traffic congestion. The narrow passageways of the gates probably exacerbated the problem. The appearance of pedestrian passageways in Pompeii is perhaps the result of efforts trying to relieve it.</p><p>Authorities could separate cart traffic and pedestrians so that they both had an easier 644 J.

Similarly, the post-earthquake emphasis on the gates seems as much a matter of projecting the rebirth of the city as it is a reassertion of local authority.</p><p>In this context the Porta Ercolano is a prime example of this development. In practical terms the pedestrian passageways helped to regulate and relieve traffic congestion on a main artery into the city. More importantly, the gate not only symbolized the benefaction of the emperor, but also the return of order and the state after the devastating earthquake.</p><p>These factors also explain the continued emphasis on the proper maintenance of the embellishments on the gates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change and Continuity in the Towers</head><p>Following the analysis of the curtain walls and gates, we return to the towers which, by and large, display similar trends. Many carry the unmistakable marks of repairs occurring mostly in the early colony. <ref type="bibr">648</ref> Tower II presents some radical alterations to its original structure. Parts of the remains contain modern restorations, but clear seams in the masonry confirm its layout. Brickwork laid in regularly spaced toothed quoins, a technique adopted with increasing sophistication in the first century BCE, confirms restoration work carried out after the siege (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_117">84</ref>). <ref type="bibr">649</ref> As addressed previously, the unusual floating postern on its western flank suggests a drastic lowering of the surrounding terrain. Equally unusual are the rectangular openings in the front and back walls of the main chamber. Assuming that the modern reconstruction is largely correct, it seems that at some point after the early colonial restorations the tower radically changed function with the addition of the large openings. The circumstances of Tower II are peculiar enough to merit a separate discussion below.</p><p>Tower III to the east prominently displays opus vittatum mixtum quoins on the remaining corners of the main chamber and a patch of brickwork on the western wall (fig.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>85). Maiuri suggests that the quoins represent early Imperial reparations and describes</head><p>Towers III, IV and V as mozzate, or chopped off, during the earthquake and never rebuilt. <ref type="bibr">650</ref> The emergency brick patchwork and the application of opus vittatum mixtum construction technique, however, are typical of the post-earthquake period. <ref type="bibr">651</ref> A small surviving patch of stucco on the eastern quoin points to the application of a new decorative coat restoring its appearance after the repairs. These interventions perhaps connect with a resumption of the burial activities in the necropolis below in the last years of the city after a brief period of abandonment. <ref type="bibr">652</ref> Heading toward the amphitheater, modern masonry almost entirely composes the remains of Tower IV and fall outside of our analysis (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_93">59</ref>). Tower V presents extensive toothed brickwork in its quoins and southern flank. The construction technique is very similar to that of Tower II suggesting that its refurbishment occurred in the early colony (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_119">86</ref>). The ground floor inside the tower has no pavement, and it remains <ref type="bibr">650</ref> Maiuri believed that the quoins represent an early imperial reconstruction based on the employment of opus vittatum mixtum at the Porta Ercolano that he dates to the Augustan period. Maiuri, "Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei," 232. <ref type="bibr">651</ref> Frӧlich convincingly shows that this technique is likely a post-earthquake introduction. See Frӧlich, "La porta di Ercolano a Pompei e la cronologia dell'opus vittatum mixtum." 652 Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 151-153.</p><p>unclear when or why it was removed. Modern masonry composes much of the structure higher up. If restored correctly, the floating back door and side entrances are probably the result of a lowering of the agger associated with the construction of the amphitheater in 70 BCE (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_94">60</ref>). A sliver of surviving opus vittatum mixtum masonry, set below a modern restoration on the first corner of the stairway, suggests a post-earthquake restoration carried out in conjunction with similar repairs on the neighboring amphitheater. <ref type="bibr">653</ref> Adjacent Tower VI does not indicate any major refurbishments in its surviving masonry. Like its neighbor, it also lacks a pavement on the ground floor. Curiously, the corridor accessing the postern sits some 1.5 meters lower than the door to the main chamber making it accessible only by stairs. The steps are otherwise missing, due perhaps to their original construction in perishable materials. Construction of the amphitheater lowered the agger enough to impede access thorough the rear and northern side entrance (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_120">87</ref>). As a result, only the southern doorway continued to offer direct access into the building. This is the second of the three towers surrounding the amphitheater clearly displaying measures that reduced its military effectiveness and enhanced its representational role. We shall return to this aspect below.</p><p>Passed the Porta Sarno, Tower VII also presents clear evidence of restorations.</p><p>The quoins on each side of the building still display traces of opus vittatum composed of small tufa blocks and set in broad teeth (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_121">88</ref>). The application of this technique is rare at Pompeii and its earliest attested use is in the large arcades of the amphitheater. <ref type="bibr">654</ref> Despite the different material, the concept behind the technique is similar to the <ref type="bibr">653</ref> The entire upper arcade of the amphitheater in opus vittatum mixtum is likely a post-earthquake reconstruction.

Also, Pesando and  Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 72.  brickwork highlighted in Towers II and V, and likely represents the same reconstruction event.</p><p>Further west, the remains of Tower VIII still preserve most of their lower stucco and display clear signs of alteration and demilitarization. The arrow slits on the lowest floor were modified and partially filled in with masonry. Inside, white stucco frames carefully highlight the modified openings, implying their use for an unspecified period of time. On the exterior, extra stucco work masked the alterations but it remains unclear when this transformation occurred. The new arrow slits suggest that the tower changed its strategic role. The windows were clearly adjusted for small caliber weapons indicating that defenders no longer needed to worry about, or no longer possessed, the necessary organization to withstand well-organized sieges. Soon afterward the postern was walled up and the exterior covered with stucco to hide the alteration (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_122">89</ref>). <ref type="bibr">655</ref> Johannowsky suggests that defensive strategies called for the express camouflaging of the postern and troops would only smash through it in case of a sortie. However, the arch jambs still carry traces of a previous stucco coat indicating that it was once open. <ref type="bibr">656</ref> Instead, the careful application of new stucco marks a clear effort to preserve the representative aspect of the tower throughout its history. The earthquake subsequently damaged the building and it effectively ceased to function when a shabby concrete wall closed off the stairs leading to the main chamber. A few fragments of the tower recovered in the lapilli suggest that parts of the building were still standing at the time of the eruption, but that it largely stood abandoned and in ruins. 657 655 Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 28-31. Her excavations recovered dumped earthquake debris in front of the postern, supplying a terminus ante quem for its closure. <ref type="bibr">656</ref> Johannowsky, "Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina," 131. <ref type="bibr">657</ref> Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 28-31.</p><p>Nearby, the ruins of Tower IX differ significantly. Recent excavations have demonstrated that they are part of a post-Sullan reconstruction of the building that included the adjacent curtain wall. The same investigations recovered fragments of the previous tower as they had fallen during the siege. They still carried the original decorative First-Style stucco thereby providing direct evidence of the continuous use of the style on the towers. The remains preserve a barrel vault covering a large chamber (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_123">90</ref>).

The lack of stairs and further windows have led the excavators to conclude that the new building only had a ground floor and eventually changed its function to a warehouse.</p><p>Nevertheless, the exterior of the rebuilt structure also featured First-Style embellishments suggesting that it retained some sort military or public function in unison with the fortifications. <ref type="bibr">658</ref> The three towers on the north side of Pompeii do not reveal any distinct repairs in the masonry (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_124">91</ref>).

As mentioned, early properties still allowed for a measure of defense since their wide-open terraces were able to accommodate defensive troops. With the advent of the colony the houses eventually spilled over and incorporated the walls (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_80">46</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">671</ref> The exact phasing of this process remains elusive and probably occurred on an individual property basis continuing well into the Julio-Claudian period and beyond. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">672</ref> Identifying the old line of the walls became increasingly difficult and owners deliberately covered up the masonry of the city walls with wall paintings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">673</ref> Only the House of Umbricius Scaurus (VII.16.15), straddling the walls slightly north of the Porta Marina, included a nod toward the ancient fortifications with a new luxury wing extending slightly beyond the walls built to resemble a defensive tower. <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">674</ref> Private property also started chipping away at the fortifications in Regio VI after construction of the Augustan castellum led to the closure of the inner pomerial road at the base of the agger. The effect upon the city walls was less dramatic, essentially turning most of the north-south roads of the Regio into private dead-end streets. The House of the Vestals (VI.1.7) eventually incorporated a large part of the agger between the Porta Ercolano and Tower XII. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">675</ref> As the Vespasianic intervention suggests, the expansion of the houses onto the fortifications was not always legal. Nevertheless, they most likely occurred with permission of the ordo decurionum since these projects are too massive and well-coordinated to represent illegal construction activity. <ref type="bibr">676</ref> As the expansion continued the old city walls faded away and together with them went the identity of Samnite Pompeii. 677</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE FORTIFICATIONS</head><p>Broadly speaking, the evidence above highlights a distinct trend: the city walls received an early refurbishment, followed by a weakening of the line in the Augustan period, and ending with reconstruction efforts of the northern gates in the post-earthquake period. These developments largely fall in line with the wider political and historical events of the centuries in consideration. Throughout the history of the Roman colony the walls seem to dramatically change function from a defensive to a more ceremonial role.</p><p>We have already noted that the First-Style stucco on the towers and gates projected their association with the proper image of the city, but the fortifications also embodied the notions of romanitas, securitas, dignitas, and virtus. The extent to which these notions were associated with the walls changed over time, achieving various degrees of complexity that hinged upon the changing urban, social, and political developments.</p><p>Given the instability of the Italian peninsula during the early colony, military considerations likely motivated Cuspius and Loreius to rebuild the walls. In this context, the hypothesis identifying the reconstruction occurring in conjunction with the revolt of Spartacus is certainly plausible. Nevertheless, their actions are also appropriate to the establishment of the colonial identity and their euergetism is also an extension of their <ref type="bibr">676</ref> Jacobelli, "Pompei fuori le mura. Note sulla gestione e l'organizzazione dello spazio pubblico e privato," 57-58. <ref type="bibr">677</ref> Tybout, "Rooms with a View," 408.</p><p>colony's position in hostile territory. As a result major city gates heralded the entrance back into civilization and projected romanitas, or Romanness, and the protection of Rome. In this context the fortifications also acted as engines of mutual assimilation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">683</ref> City walls were therefore inherently symbolic of a colony's status, signifying its allegiance to Rome, but also its liberty and independence as the privileged markers of actually possessing them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">684</ref> Pompeii was not an ex-novo foundation, but these ideals likely permeated the new colony, leading to the necessity to rebuild the walls in a way that had little bearing on their intrinsic military value.</p><p>A multitude of factors led to the successive weakening of the fortifications. With the establishment of the pax augusta the focus on defending the empire shifted to faraway frontiers. As a result, some scholars describe the city walls built during this period as ceremonial rather than defensive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">685</ref> At Pompeii the period saw a progressive reduction of the defenses with easier access routes into the city and the increased occupation of the fortified line. This phenomenon has led scholars to identify a slow and inexorable decline of the fortifications, including outright abandonment. Yet the evidence suggests that the gates continued to form crucial controlled passageways in and out of the city, perhaps as a reflection of the new emphasis on the state. This development reflects a similar situation occurring in Rome, where the expansion of the city eventually took over and incorporated the line of the Servian Wall built in the fourth century BCE. As the limits of the empire grew, so did the city, and the two conflated to symbolize the power of the Roman state. 686</p><p>An explanation for the degraded military capabilities of the walls may also lie in the absence of a regular body of troops to maintain the walls. Three cohorts were stationed at Pompeii during the first civil war and they offered Cicero control of the city as he passed through on his way to join Pompey in Greece in 49 BCE. <ref type="bibr">687</ref> Their presence may explain some minor modifications such as those present on Tower VIII. Presumably the pax augusta led to their withdrawal and re-deployment elsewhere. It is not until after the riots of 59 CE between the Nucerians and Pompeians that the Senate sent the Praetorian Guard to restore the order and troops were once again in the city. Their deployment perhaps explains some of the minor repairs carried out on the towers and wall curtain in the last years of the city.</p><p>Despite their faltering, the defenses still formed a formidable barrier and, as highlighted above, the city added a new emphasis on the gates in the early Imperial period. Perhaps a more productive line of approach to establish their role is to try and answer what exactly the walls intended to keep out. As mentioned in the introduction, city walls also kept out unwanted elements including wild beasts and bandits. These factors clearly played a role throughout the history of the city, but they are particularly clear for the colonial period. In particular wild wolves spotted within the perimeter of the walls were one of the worst omens that could befall a Roman city. They represented an affront to the city's protective gods and also symbolized, death, war, and the wider threats posed by dangerous species. 688 Bandits were similar undesirable elements. They 686 Favro, "A City in Flux.

The two were not mutually exclusive and gates acted as formalized filtering points for the continuous movement of produce and the population. <ref type="bibr">692</ref> The Porta Marina, for example, continued to function as a boundary marker despite the urbanization process occurring around it. In simple terms gates continued their role as tax barriers and we find parallel examples in the custom points first designated under Augustus specifically for this purpose in Rome.</p><p>Their role became so important that architects of the later Aurelian wall included many existing toll points in its circuit rather than designating new gates to the city. A striking connection with Pompeii lies in the redefinition of the custom points in Rome during the censorship of Vespasian and Titus in 73-74 CE, and perhaps further explains the emphasis on the gates in the final years of the city, especially if we consider the work of Suedius Clemens returning illegally public land to the state. <ref type="bibr">693</ref> In this context, it is not surprising that the gates on the north side were the objects of an elaborate reconstruction despite the fact that many areas of the curtain walls were abandoned.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CITY</head><p>Beyond the practical reasons for the changes in the fortifications they continued to resonate in the social and urban matrix of the city. The influx of veterans marked a dramatic shift in its demographic and social make-up, but the exact connotations of this event remains debated. Scholars estimate their numbers anywhere between an entire legion, i.e., 4000-5000 men, and about half that number, all bringing with them family and dependents. <ref type="bibr">694</ref> The debate also concerns the extent of property reallocation, a process that often accompanied the establishment of a colony, where the new settlers lived, and how they interacted with the local population. <ref type="bibr">695</ref> A point of contention is that many of the grand houses remained in the hands of the old aristocracy, but proscriptions did occur and many properties changed hands. <ref type="bibr">696</ref> In broad terms scholarship now identifies three main areas where more affluent colonists settled; the large agricultural villas north of the city, a series of houses lining the via Marina/via dell'Abbondanza axis near the Forum, and the houses along the south and western ridge of the city. <ref type="bibr">697</ref> These concentrations reflect the new order; the reallocation of the villas represent an economic takeover, the dwellings near the Forum highlight the presence of the elite near the political center of the city, and the houses along the ridge exploited the views and luxury of the city for the new <ref type="bibr">694</ref> For the latest on the debate see Zevi, "Pompei dalla città sannitica alla colonia sillana: per un'interpretazione dei dati archeologici," 130-132 and Lo Cascio, "La società pompeiana dalla città sannitica alla colonia romana," 123-125.

Athenaeum 86, no. 2 (1998): 440-444. 695 Much of the exploited land remained property of large centralized villas. If land reallocation did occur it probably was never completed or the colonists quickly sold their allotments. For the latest on the matter see Savino, "Note su Pompei colonia sillana: popolazione, strutture agrarie, ordinamento istituzionale," 448-455. 696 See J.

He borrows this method from Zevi who used it to identify many of new owners of villas outside of Pompeii as pro-roman or even just Roman colonists. See F. Zevi, "La città sannitica l'edilizia privata e la Casa del Fauno." In Pompei 1. (Naples, 1991) 71-72 and also Zevi, "Pompei dalla città sannitica alla colonia sillana: per un'interpretazione dei dati archeologici," 130, and Lo Cascio,"Pompei dalla città sannitica alla colonia sillana: le vicende istituzionali," 122.

To some extent it may relate to the notion of "façadism" where the owner deliberately chose to preserve or change façades as a reflection of his identity, status, or even political allegiance. <ref type="bibr">705</ref> Stephan Mols recently pointed out that the First Style on the exterior of buildings saw a particular resurgence in the Augustan period as a reflection of the renewed emphasis on social mores during his reign. This connection also relates to the proposed origin of the style as an imitation of Athenian civic architecture and the Augustan exaltation of the Classical Greek aesthetic. <ref type="bibr">706</ref> The application of the First Style in the Augustan period, therefore, seems to respond to the fashion and politics of the time. It may also reflect a conscious effort to replicate the effect of white marble, especially if we consider its role as a status marker after the opening of the Carrara marble quarries under Augustus. <ref type="bibr">707</ref> In fact, the very opening of these quarries allowed the emperor to boast that he transformed Rome into a city of marble and went hand in hand with the development of the new Imperial ideology. <ref type="bibr">708</ref> The notions of civic duty and private euergetism to the community were particularly strong in Roman society. It was duty of those who had the resources to <ref type="bibr">705</ref> The idea that it might relate to façadism in particular came up in a private conversation with Prof.</p><p>Clarke. Recently J. Richards broadly defines facadism as the deliberate preservation of the facades of historic buildings, while a new building may appear behind it, or the choice of erecting replicas. Similarly architects may design specific facades to fit into and reflect an already existing cityscape. See J. Richards,  Facadism (London, 1994), 7. Such elements may have played a part in the deliberate retention of the tufa facades. The elaboration of this hypothesis, however, merits further investigation elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">706</ref> As suggested by S.</p><p>T.A.M.

It is important to remember that the individuals sponsoring projects dictated the style, building types, and their placement in the city, thereby implicitly reflecting their ideology. <ref type="bibr">709</ref> Extending their benevolence on the community through the construction of fortifications was therefore an important symbolic act that carried with it political calculation. Furthermore, it was through the power of their office and their personal wealth that these men could set in motion building programs. Ambitious projects were therefore also the object of jealously and sometimes blocked when those who sponsored them were set to gain too much influence on the community. Nevertheless, euergetism was part of the politics of the period since grand endowments promoted the status of the individual amongst the population.</p><p>Wealthy provincial individuals hoping to join the political process in Rome first had to prove their mettle at home. <ref type="bibr">710</ref> A brief look at the actions of the men of the early ordo decurionum serves to highlight their role in the early colony and further explains why figures such as Loreius and Cuspius chose specifically to rebuild the fortifications. The two most prominent men of the ordo, Marcus Porcius and Quinctius Valgus, were fedelissimi of Sulla and both profited handsomely from his proscriptions. Their personal advancement was directly related to Sulla's cause and their building activity reflected both their personal ambition and that of the Roman dictator. They were responsible for the completion of the teatrum tectum and the amphitheater, two of the most imposing buildings of the new colony.</p><p>Valgus in particular was very familiar with the importance of architecture as a means to define a city and therefore its use to advance such claims. Originally from Hirpinia, he served as patronus municipii, or city patron, in Aeclanum, where he paid for the <ref type="bibr">709</ref> Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society, 24. <ref type="bibr">710 Castrén,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ordo Populusque Pompeianus,</ref><ref type="bibr">[87]</ref><ref type="bibr">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr">[92]</ref> construction of the city walls including the towers and gates. <ref type="bibr">711</ref> He is also mentioned as a duumvir quinquennalis for an unidentified settlement near Abellinum where he built the city walls and gates, the Forum, the Curia, and a cistern. <ref type="bibr">712</ref> His sponsorship of city walls attests to the role these structures played in the establishment of urban identities, and the ideals of the new elite of Pompeii. These elements suggest that the reconstruction of the fortifications was a reflection of the city's colonial status and part of the euergetism expected from its leaders. <ref type="bibr">713</ref> It was in the interest of the local elite, therefore, to achieve a complete civic image as part of their own political claims. Interestingly, Pompeii by this stage had already built many of the buildings that could define it as a Roman city. In fact, it included a Forum and a Basilica; spaces which were inherently part of what constituted a Roman colony. <ref type="bibr">714</ref> Pompeii likely adopted them as part of its alliance with Rome.</p><p>Nevertheless, the buildings erected and modified in the early colony period reveal a distinct effort to further claim the city as Roman. For example, the modifications to the Temple of Apollo, one of the oldest cults in the city, were a clear act of appropriation.</p><p>Similarly, the transformation of the Temple of Jupiter into a capitolium was a reference to Rome. Furthermore, its placement facing the open forum followed a blue print stretching back to the earliest Roman colonial foundations such as Ostia.

Recent reevaluations, however, suggest a more complicated reasoning tying the building in to the status of Pompeii as a colony. To a certain extent the traditional views still hold true; engineers likely chose the agger as a convenient terrace to shore up the building.

To build the amphitheater the duoviri needed to conduct costly expropriations, demolitions, and perhaps even receive special dispensation from the city council to build on the city walls. <ref type="bibr">719</ref> Tybout has even gone as far as relating the choice of placing the building directly on the fortifications to a political statement of conquest and subjugation rather than just a simple matter of convenience.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_138">foot_138</ref> </p><p>More importantly, the amphitheater also carried a relationship to the army, and its veterans, and the colonial identity of the city. A recent theory sees the amphitheater as part of a wider military entertainment complex that included an early version of the neighboring Palestra. <ref type="bibr">721</ref> Although an early version of the Palestra remains uncertain, the notion of an entertainment complex initially designed specifically for veterans seems plausible. A building this large carried intrinsic meanings beyond its connections to gladiatorial fighting and included a strong relationship between the army and the Roman colonies of the late Republic. By the first century BCE soldiers trained in gladiatorial techniques and watched spectacles to introduce them to the brutal realities of battle. <ref type="bibr">722</ref> Army camps often included amphitheaters and its appearance at Pompeii with a contingent of veterans is a clear result of these associations. In this context the connection between the amphitheater and army camps included visual similarities between the stairways of the arena and the ramps flanking camp gates, giving its façade a reference lost on the modern viewer. <ref type="bibr">723</ref> The new amphitheater also acted on a regional level as a spectacular landmark the Catiline conspiracy. The orator praised Sulla as an exemplary citizen and pointed to his role as an arbiter quelling dissension and tensions between the two populations in the colony. The exact connotations of these disputes are the matter of an extensive scholarly debate that we need not revisit here but, as a recent theory prudently points out, the tensions most likely also divided along the pro-Roman and pro-Italian lines of the Social War.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_141">foot_141</ref> Given Pompeii's previous allegiance, the intensity of the conflict, and its lingering effects, authorities probably isolated the towers as a security measure. Similarly the revolt of Spartacus, quelled only after a long and bloody conflict that directly involved Campania and the environs of Pompeii, had exposed the dangers related to the gathering of large numbers of gladiators. In both cases the inaccessibility of the towers prevented their hostile takeover during an uprising or riot, and provided a powerful reminder of civic order especially if they were visibly manned during gladiatorial contests.</p><p>If we follow the traditional dating sequence, the addition of the so-called Palestra radically changed the district with the advent of the empire. The building became part of an organic unit with the amphitheater and its presence altered the meaning of the walls in the district. <ref type="bibr">729</ref> The Palestra, in essence a large three-sided portico with an internal pool, is still massive and of equal size to the amphitheater occupying some six regular insulae of the city. Its exact function remains somewhat obscure, but it seems to have worked as a physical and moral courage needed to command units in combat. <ref type="bibr">733</ref> Considering the associations between the nearby amphitheater, the fortifications, and their embellishments, a wider symbolism seems at work in the area. Together they projected virtus, the Augustan renewed emphasis on social mores accompanying the image of the proper colony. This was the strongest beliefs connected to military life and, along with the notion of pietas, fundamental to the Augustan ideals accompanying the program of civic renewal and construction of city walls on the Italian peninsula. <ref type="bibr">734</ref> The district and <ref type="bibr">730</ref> Welch, The Roman Amphitheatre: From its Origins to the Colosseum, 95-100. <ref type="bibr">731</ref> Ling, "Development of Pompeii's Public Landscape in the Roman Period," 123. <ref type="bibr">732 Zanker,</ref><ref type="bibr">Pompeii.

They feature a high base supporting an aedicula or cella usually displaying statues of the deceased. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">737</ref> The type lost popularity in the Julio-Claudian period when new more elaborate forms appeared in conjunction with the rise of wealthy freedmen who replaced some of the established elite. The new forms included the schola, circular superstructure, chamber, and altar-type tombs that expressly mimicked civic honorific architecture in an effort to connect the deceased with the image of the city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">738</ref> The dialogue between civic and funerary structures continued with the use of the First Style on the exterior of tombs where it symbolized the notions of citizenship and the city. The aedicula tombs in particular alluded more directly to the city walls. The surviving decoration suggests that they lacked the orthostate-ashlar sequence otherwise characteristic of the First-Style. Instead they only displayed stucco imitative ashlars as a reflection of the masonry that made up the city walls and the embellishments on the towers and gates. The correlation between the two is likely an explicit reference to the role of the newly refurbished fortifications as markers of the city, or as the functional dividers between the realm of the living and the dead, or both. <ref type="bibr">739</ref> A further connection perhaps lies in the shape of the aedicula tombs and the nearby towers. Most known examples of the type lie on the western side of the Porta Nocera necropolis at the foot of Tower II. As described previously, the tower stood on a high isolated podium, as did its nearby neighbor to the east. Along with their construction technique of brick quoined opus incertum, the architectural similarity between towers and tombs is striking. The large opening on the façade of Tower II may reflect its later transformation into an aedicula similar to the tombs, or for that matter, some of the other funerary structures featuring high podia nearby (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_132">99</ref>). Excavation notebooks report the discovery of an epitaph in the main chamber of the tower during the excavations of the 1950s. The report describes its recovery in a layer of backfill deposited inside the building sometime after its first excavation in the 1800s. <ref type="bibr">740</ref> Although this is a secondary context, the epitaph presumably came from the near vicinity-perhaps even from the building itself (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_150">100</ref>). The notebook tells us its dimensions, 42x28x4</p><p>.5 centimeters, and the literal transcription reads: P. TIN. TIRIVS. P. T. ADIVTOR. ET TIN. TIRIAE. ESTAE ILIAE. SVAE. V. ANNVII ET. SIBI ET.

Assuming continuity in excavation nomenclature, this associates it with Tower II since Maiuri later describes it as 1. See Maiuri, Pompei ed Ercolano: Fra case e abitanti, 82-83. RI. SVAE. ET SVIS Unfortunately no other information exists regarding the epitaph and the transcription in the excavation diary seems to contain a few errors.

Tintirius Rufus, who served as an aedile in the year 2 BCE. This was a comparatively low office amongst those available in the governance of the city, but it attests that, for a time at least, the Tintirii were part of the Pompeian elite and perhaps competed for prominence in the funerary landscape. <ref type="bibr">742</ref> Considering the inherent height and dominant position of the tower, its re-use as a tomb is not inconceivable in a period when individuals increasingly appropriated the terrain belt associated with the fortifications. In addition, the competition for space in the Porta Nocera necropolis rapidly increased as it expanded first toward the Porta Stabia and later toward the amphitheater in the Julio-Claudian period. <ref type="bibr">743</ref> In these circumstances, the 741 I wish to thank Prof. A.

Its transition into private hands may also explain its derelict state, if the expropriations conducted by Suedius Clemens led to the partial demolition of the building. Although we cannot prove that the expropriations led to the demolition of tombs, a nearby schola tomb strikingly displays the signs of a similar fate (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_134">101</ref>). <ref type="bibr">744</ref> Admittedly, the evidence for a complete transformation of the tower into a tomb is somewhat circumstantial, but it does help explain the curious remains.</p><p>In any event, the correlation between fortifications and funerary architecture continued more tangibly in the walls that increasingly fenced off tombs starting in the first century BCE. <ref type="bibr">745</ref> Outside of Pompeii, a series of unique late-Republican miniature funerary reliefs found mostly in Campania and central Italy, further elucidate the connection between the enclosures and city walls. <ref type="bibr">746</ref> The reliefs separately depict the typical monumental cavaedium (court) gates, and towers similar to those of Torino and Spello that appeared in Italy during the Augustan program of civic renewal (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_116">83</ref>). <ref type="bibr">747</ref> Although most examples are now without context, they probably appeared in tomb enclosures to mimic the city walls that were often located nearby (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_151">102</ref>).

Amongst the surviving examples many have doorways offering access to the tombs, whereas others featured small jogs to secure a ladder, or included rough lava boulders set as steps in the concrete to climb over the wall. <ref type="bibr">749</ref> The most prominent enclosures, located primarily in the Porta Ercolano necropolis, featured further decorations. For example, the Tomb of N. Festius Ampliatus prominently displayed gladiatorial reliefs on the exterior. Another pair of gladiators is painted on one of the interior walls of the Tomb of Caius Vestorius Priscus at the Porta Vesuvio. These scenes are particularly apt to the funerary realm given the funerary origin of the combats. <ref type="bibr">750</ref> Another common theme is the presence of small merlons marking the enclosures. <ref type="bibr">751</ref> On occasion the merlons also featured small detailed scenes related to the funerary realm including scenes of offering, or depictions of the Oedipus and the sphinx (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_136">103</ref>). The two merlons facing the road on the cenotaph of the augustales C.</p><p>Calventius Quietus featured Victoria carrying a Celtic horn, a motif borrowed from triumphal art. <ref type="bibr">752</ref> As is the case with the Palestra, these merlons referenced the ideal of <ref type="bibr">748</ref> See F.

In the Etruscan figurative tradition gates often represented the separation between the dead and the living, and were sometimes represented as city gates. See G. Camporeale, "La città murata d'Etruria nella tradizione letteraria e figurativa." In La città murata in Etruria (Pisa 2008): 22. 749 Typical examples are: the Tomb of M. Obellius Firmus outside of Porta Nola, tomb ES7 at the Porta Nocera, and South tomb G at the Fondo Pacifico. 750 Kockel, Die Gräbbauten vor dem Herkulaner Tor in Pompeji, 75, 84. 751 The most marked examples are tomb ES5 at the Porta Nocera, the tombs of Marcus Veius Marcellus and Caius Vestorius Priscus outside the Porta Vesuvio, Tomb of Naevoleia Tyche (süd 22), Tomb of Numerius Istacidius Helenus (süd 21), Tomb of C. Calventius Quietus (süd 20) Caius Fabius Secundus (süd 18), and Aulus Umbricius Scaurus (süd 17). 752 Many disappeared soon after excavation but Mazois recorded four surviving examples. One merlon featured Victoria carrying a Celtic horn, a motif borrowed from triumphal art. A second depicted Oedipus probably served to foster erudite conversations during elaborate meals (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_139">106</ref>). It is a simultaneous narrative of the story from the moment the son of Daedalus plunges to his death after nearing the sun to the recovery of his body. <ref type="bibr">758</ref> Notably the artist depicted Crete, or Knossos, in the background as a heavily fortified city showing its walls surrounding a mass of unidentifiable buildings. The towers and the gates prominently face the viewer and stand out as the most obvious markers of the city. The artist displays the fortifications as robust ramparts built in regular ashlar isodomic masonry that may reflect the opus quadratum of the walls of Pompeii. More importantly, it is not the collection of buildings that symbolize the city, but rather their placement behind the protection of fortified defenses that complete its image and status.</p><p>The House of the Lararium of Achilles (I.6.4) contains a similar but more simplistic example in the stucco frieze depicting the Homeric cycle in a sacellum dedicated to the familial cult. In three separate instances the artist, although clearly constrained by the limited space of the frieze, chose to render Troy as a simple large city gate flanked by two large towers (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_140">107</ref>). Each scene depicts the departure from or the arrival to Troy, whether it is Hector in the act of leaving to confront Achilles, the dragging of his body around the city, or Priam recovering his remains. <ref type="bibr">759</ref> The gate vault is overly large to accommodate the figures. The gate itself is reminiscent of the large tower-flanked gates built in the Augustan period throughout the Roman west. In both cases, and these are certainly not isolated examples, the visual and imaginative concept of 758 See V. Sampaolo, "I 7,7: Casa del Sacredos Amandus." In Pompei: Pitture e mosaici 1(Rome, 1990), 594-596. 759 N. Blanc, "L'Égnimatique Sacello Iliaco: Contribution à l'ètude des cultes domestiques." In I temi figurativi nella pittura parietale antica (IV Sec. a.C.-IV Sec. d.C.): Atti del VI convegno internazionale sulla pittura parietale antica, edited by D. Scagliarini Corlàita (Bologna, 1997): 37-38. the city translated to the fortifications enclosing it more than any other architectural element. 760 Images of fortifications also gained popularity as framing bands in black-andwhite mosaics during the first century BCE. They originate from the imitative carpet fringes bordering Hellenistic mosaics. 761 Although lost to us, the most elaborate carpets were probably a status symbol, and the translation of their borders into city walls may reflect similar connotations of elite ostentation and perhaps even citizenship. The earliest examples of fortified bands date to the late third and mid-second century BCE and were found in opulent houses in the Roman colonies of Atri and Suasa in Italy (fig.108). 762 They likely referred to the notions of securitas, dignitas, and the projection of Roman power associated with the fortifications of colonies exposed in enemy territory. In the late Republic and early Principate they became particularly popular in Italy and the Roman west as explicit emblems of romanitas reflecting the real fortifications built in new 760 Simple representations of city walls appear in the early third century BCE Esquiline tomb of Fabius or Fannius. Here at least one scene shows a simple monolithic wall with merlons representing a city. Later more complicated renditions of city walls coincide with broader urban images such as the fresco depicting a city in a cryptoporticus beneath the Baths of Trajan in Rome. The fresco illustrates an ideal Roman city complete with characteristic monuments, such as temples and theaters, and the city walls feature prominently as part of the urban ideal.

The panel here fits into a wider patterned repertoire of crenellated-tower patterns, discussed further below, and its isolated context suggests its primary function as a decorative motif. <ref type="bibr">770</ref> The examples contained in the villas of Diomedes, and P. Fannius Synistor are either completely lost or in such a fragmentary state as not to merit extensive discussion (fig.110). 771 Suffice it to say that, like the panel in the House of the Menander, they functioned in Second-Style ensembles in luxury dwellings associated with the new colonists. They may therefore have carried further symbolic references with the refurbished fortifications of Pompeii such as romanitas. With these issues in mind, Pompeii also preserves examples that are specific commissions diverging from the typical representations. They have induced 769 See Becatti, Mosaici e pavimenti marmorei, 297-299 and also Lavagne, "Un embléme de Romanitas: Le motif des tours et ramparts en mosaïque," 138-139. 770 The Second-Style panel is heavily damaged but still displays the corner of a city gate and a wall curtain rendered in opus quadratum and capped with an oversized T-shaped merlon. It leads to a tower with a small window. Ling describes it as a single gate flanked by two towers, whereas Iorio rightly identifies a continuation of the enceinte on each side of the tower. This continuation suggests that it derived from band mosaics. Ling et.al The Insula of the Menander at Pompeii: The Decorations 58; Iorio, "La presenza della cinta muraria nei mosaici di Pompei," 290. Scholars have consistently described the Poppaei as the gens owning the house. They eventually produced Poppea, the wife of Nero. Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 122. 771 The example in the Villa of Diomedes is preserved only in an early nineteenth century drawing. See L.Barré, Ercolano e Pompei: Raccolta generale de pitture, bronzi, mosaici, vol. 5 (Venice, 1862) fig. 6.4. The drawing shows an elaborate enceinte surrounding a labyrinth with no entry or exit. It dates to anywhere between 80 and 60 BCE. See Kern, Labirinti 25-26, 115 for the date. The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor once contained an early example of a complete band mosaic depicting a fortification running around the entirety of the small peristyle. Today only a fragment survives dated variously to the early Second-Style and the Imperial period. See F.Barnabei, La villa pompeiana di P.

Excavators originally found them re-used in a threshold and the peristyle floor of the house. <ref type="bibr">780</ref> Damaged in the earthquake of 62 CE, the theory proposes that the fragments found their way into the house because one of the two duumvirs was an ancestor of its last owner. <ref type="bibr">781</ref> The evidence is again somewhat circumstantial, especially if we consider that the inscription ended up in the floors rather than a more prominent position referencing the ancestry of the owner.</p><p>Yet, if we assume a continuity of ownership, the fauces mosaic may represent a direct commission by one of the duumvirs to further celebrate his euergetism. In any event, all we can really say is that the fauces mosaic reflects the owner's strong identification with the symbols of Pompeii. In this context the fortifications in the threshold likely reference to the newly refurbished city walls as a conceptual expression of the colony and its romanitas. Such an expression is all the more compelling if we accept the Loreii, Cuspii, or Caesii as owners of the house, since all three were strong pro-Sullan gentes supplying duumvirs early in the colony.</p><p>The House of the Wild Boar (VIII.3.8) preserves a spectacular example of a mosaic with city walls in its atrium (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_145">112</ref>).

Scholars first identified it as a Second-Style mosaic due largely to its erroneous attribution to the House of the Silver Wedding. A new evaluation identified it as a rare Third-Style composition dating to the early Augustan era. See also, V. Sampaolo, "IX 8, 3.7: Casa del Centenario." In Pompei: Pitture e mosaici, 9 pt.2 (Rome, 1990), 978-980. The gorgon and fortified scene, both facing the rear of the room, acted as an apotropaic device safeguarding the individuals inside. However, the fortified circuit and its inclusion in the emblema is a motif without known parallels that was probably uniquely associated with the owner. The composition fits into a wider marine decorative theme of the house linking perhaps to the merchant profession of the owner, or as a port metaphor for the safety and refuge offered by the home. <ref type="bibr">789</ref> The two panels in the cubiculum likely composed a single scene, and a recent theory suggests that the mosaic might even depict a city particularly dear to the owner, perhaps Alexandria, due to the presence of the lighthouse and the palm tree. <ref type="bibr">790</ref> If it indeed represents the Egyptian city, the rendition of the walls and the lighthouse are a remarkable short hand for the large and complex metropolis.</p><p>Less complex city wall renditions, typical of the Second-Style, involve seriated towers joined with low curtain walls placed in thresholds.

The polychrome mosaic features an ingenious reversible design where the merlons of each tower form the crenellations of the opposite low curtain walls and vice-versa, resulting in a line of fortifications on either side. The overall result depicts two lines of walls that clearly announced the limits of the room on each side. <ref type="bibr">791</ref> The space was a tablinum of sorts that still contains a prestigious emblema in opus scutulatum, a rarity for this period in Pompeii. Its presence, along with a general refurbishment of the dwelling in the early colony, has led to a recent conclusion this was an ordo-decurionum house, belonging perhaps to one of the founders of the colony. 792</p><p>A slightly simpler band runs around the impluvium of the House of Cornelius Rufus (VIII.4.15). Now almost completely destroyed, a few old photographs capture its original layout composed of black and white towers alternating to form two lines; one facing the impluvium and the other the atrium (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_148">115</ref>). <ref type="bibr">793</ref> On the southern side the band jutted out to envelop the well-head and a large marble table with prominent back to back griffins as leg supports.

Scholars have otherwise, rather precariously, identified L. Calpurnius Diogenes or the Cisonii as the owners of the house. See Della Corte, Case ed abitanti di Pompei, 220. 793 I.

The mosaic is undated due to the loss of the decorative schemes in the house, although much of the atrium receives new Fourth-Style paintings.</p><p>client rituals however, and the prominence of the families, the mosaics likely also carried associations of romanitas and probably referenced the newly refurbished walls of the city.</p><p>This brief survey highlights the preponderance of city wall mosaics dating to the late Republican and early Imperial period of the colony. To a certain extent they undoubtedly were part of decorative motifs available to artists; their significance sometimes did not go beyond that. Nevertheless, their boundary defining and protective roles translate naturally from the real enceintes defending the community. The period of their highest popularity broadly coincides with the refurbishment of the fortifications.</p><p>The connection between the two occurred on multiple levels with the examples in the Pompeian pavements working as apotropaic devices and distinct emblems of the new colony. Furthermore, the mosaics provided a powerful reminder of the relationship between the city walls, the Pompeian elite, and even the political messages of the new empire. The ideals associated with city walls, their status as boundary markers, and their apotropaic and religious values, clearly connected in the domestic and political sphere to help foster the identity of the new city.</p><p>Moving beyond the mosaics, we return to the amphitheater district and the city walls framing it. The fresco depicting the riot between Pompeian and Nucerian factions offers an impression of the quarter in the years leading up to the earthquake (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_149">116</ref>). It is a vivid depiction of Tacitus's narration of the events of 59 CE which left many spectators dead, and ensured an imperial ban on games in the city for a period of ten years. <ref type="bibr">795</ref> These events are a testament to the continued importance of the district in the history of the Pompeii. The fresco is an unusual historical document responding directly <ref type="bibr">795</ref> Tacitus, Annals XIV.17.</p><p>to very specific demands of the commissioner. It therefore offers a glimpse of the buildings and the fortifications in the public imagination. The owner was likely involved in the happenings of that day and chose to immortalize and display the event in his peristyle where only selected guests could admire it. 796 However, we should remember that the fresco survives because excavators detached it from the wall and that parts of the composition may be lost and unknown.</p><p>The fresco displays the arena quarter from a bird's eye perspective, allowing the best view of the action occurring in and around the amphitheater. The artist stressed the recognizable aspects of the building including its prominent stair ramps that even today The reliefs have drawn much scholarly discussion concerning their placement, ownership, and depicted buildings. 800 A similar complex discussion involves the motive for their commission identified as commemorative, votive, or apotropaic. <ref type="bibr">801</ref> The reliefs are a clear historical document and as such differ significantly from other more generalized civic images. Their importance lies in the very conceptualization of the disaster with the Temple of Jupiter, and the Porta Vesuvio as monuments defining the city. To a certain extent this should be hardly surprising since the gate was an important landmark in the city and lies within sight of the entrance to the house. In fact, if we follow the theory outlined previously associating the gate with the ancient Porta Campana, we may even speculate that its presence on the lararium is the result of the Caecilii identifying with the campanienses electoral college. <ref type="bibr">802</ref> We have no concrete evidence of that, but the house belonged to L. Caecilius Jucundus. He was a wealthy banker and son of L. Caecilius Felix, a freedman of the Caecilii, a family tracing its roots to colonial settlers. <ref type="bibr">803</ref> As freedmen they had little direct Roman ancestry, and Lauren</p><p>Petersen recently points out how the lararium, and the main atrium where it stood, were part of a deliberate decorative design expressly creating an ancestor house to dignify the gens. Here Jucundus attempted to portray himself as more Roman than he actually was and the lararium exalted him further as an exemplary citizen of Pompeii. 804 Jucundus belonged to the wealthy freedmen, a class that often exhibited a strong identification with the status quo that had enabled their social mobility. <ref type="bibr">805</ref> Perhaps Aineias the Tactician best 801 Maiuri, L'ultima fase edilizia di Pompei, 17-21 argues for commemorative, I.

In Studi in onore di Riccardo Filangieri (Napoli, 1959),16-19 sees them in an apotropaic function. 802 Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society, 34-45 describes the strength of neighborhood identity in Pompeii and discusses a reformation of the vici under Augustus as part of the new policy of empire.

They would exhibit the most loyalty to the existing status quo since they had the most to lose if the city fell. <ref type="bibr">806</ref> The choice of associating the disaster with a collapsing Porta Vesuvio and making it the object of daily prayers in a private lararium speaks volumes about the role fortifications, and more specifically gates, still played in the concept of the city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FORTIFICATIONS AND RELIGION: APPROPRIATION, CONTINUITY, AND CHANGE</head><p>One of the common themes throughout the history of Pompeii is the religious symbolism associated with its city walls. As discussed in the previous chapters, the topic closely relates to the identity of the inhabitants and how they perceived the fortifications protecting them. In most basic terms the gods protected the city and the citizens protected them by placing their sanctuaries behind the safety of the fortifications. The direct visual association between the fortifications and the gods of the city was a recurrent theme at</p><p>Pompeii that focused on the Temple of Mefitis Fisica on the southwestern tip of the plateau, and the Temple of Minerva in the Triangular Forum. In this position they fulfilled the Vitruvian prescriptions that the temples of the protective gods should be in eminent places with commanding views of the city. <ref type="bibr">807</ref> The Roman period of Pompeii preserves important evidence revealing the depth of the connection between the gods, the city walls, and the image of the city. They suggest a complex relationship that mirrors the delicate balance of appropriation and preservation of the fortifications.</p><p>Perhaps the most recognizable and direct symbolic connection between the image of Pompeii and its city walls was the manifestation of the Venus Fisica Pompeiana. <ref type="bibr">806</ref> Aeneas Tacticus 1.6, 1.7, and 5.1. <ref type="bibr">807</ref> Vitruvius 1.7.1</p><p>Scholarship has traditionally identified her cult as an overt stamp of the dictator's conquest on the city and the construction of her temple directly onto the city walls as an indelible mark of subjugation and loss of independence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">808</ref> As evidenced previously, recent discoveries provide a less dramatic view. Cultic traces stretch to the Archaic period and downdate construction of the main sanctuary to the last quarter of the second century BCE, well before the foundation of the colony. The sanctuary featured a central temple enclosed by porticoes on three sides that afforded a visitor spacious views of the countryside and the Bay of Naples (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_96">62</ref>). This design resembled the larger sanctuaries in Italy such as Fortuna Primigenia in Palestrina, Hercules in Tivoli, and Jupiter Anxur in Terracina, reflecting Pompeii's will to join the architectural developments of the peninsula. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">809</ref> Recent scholarship also revises the cult of Venus Fisica Pompeiana as an appropriation of the Samnite Mefitis Fisica. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">810</ref> Her main sanctuary was in the territory of the Hirpini near the sources of the Sarno River in the Asanto Valley. Mefitis was the personification of bad sulfurous air and the appellative Fisica indicates her primary role as an intercessor between the underworld and the heavens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">811</ref> She also presided over fertility, initiation rites into adulthood, natural cycles, and agreements (fides), and was associated with grain, water, and the goddess Ceres. The Mamii were her principal known champions inside the city. They were an old and powerful Samnite family who later also included a prominent priestess to the cult of Venus.</p><p>The transformation of Mefitis occurred with the arrival of the colonists. Her temple received modifications that included a new decorative program and the reduction of the double terrace supporting it into a single platform (fig.118). Although less dramatic than building an entirely new temple, this modification, or completion depending on the point of view, still provided a powerful example of Roman appropriation of both the cult and the city. 812 Venus was also a personal protectress of Augustus and a subsequent refurbishment of the temple in the late Augustan period provided a similar political statement. This phase marked a grand expansion of the sanctuary leading to the further narrowing of the via Marina, and the extensive use of marble to replace the previous tufa. This move is reminiscent of the grand aurea templa, or golden temples such as the Temple of Apollo, built by the emperor to emphasize his pietas in Rome. 813 Venus Pompeiana usually carries a standard set of attributes: a mural crown or diadem, a scepter, an olive or myrtle branch, and an overturned ship's rudder. She is often heavily bejeweled and wears a blue mantle covering a purple chiton, occasionally decorated with stars (fig. 119). 814 Her attributes are similar to those of Cybele and Fortuna, sometimes leading to debates concerning her identification. Her overall iconography is close to that of the Greek Tychai personifying cities, and the rudder 812 Lepone, "Venus Fisica Pompeiana," 163-167. See also Bernabei, Contributi di archeologia vesuviana. Raccolta critica della documentazione III, i culti di Pompei, 46. And see Curti, "Venere Fisica trionfante ed il porto di Pompeii, 72. M.

On the first façade she stands opposite to a procession honoring Cybele and their combined occurrence stresses the role of both goddesses as protectress of the city.</p><p>Their presence reflects the piety of the store owner who sought their protection for his business. On the Shop of Verecundus, Venus stands in a quadriga pulled by elephants. In a separate register below her stands Verecundus, a cloth maker and owner of the store she protected. <ref type="bibr">817</ref> Along with her presence in many public and private shrines, these images attest to her widespread popularity as protectress of the city and its population.</p><p>The preservation and transformation of the cult poses some interesting questions regarding the social development of the city from the Samnite to the Roman period. The evidence from the walls and gates suggests a similar continuity but not a direct appropriation. We have already proposed that the Porta Stabia, Ercolano, Marina, Nola, and Vesuvio likely carried religious references to Minerva. However, unlike Venus Pompeiana, the references to Minerva are less evident. For example, besides the graffito mentioning PATRVA, the statuette recovered in the fill of the sidewalk at the Porta Stabia remains unidentified (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_62">28</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">818</ref> A secure identification also is lacking for the fragments Maiuri found near the Porta Ercolano. The scholar associated them with a shrine that was completely demolished along with the Samnite gate, and struggled to securely identify the pieces pointing to Venus and Minerva as possible candidates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">819</ref> In addition, the frescos of the lararium at the Porta Vesuvio were faded beyond recognition at the time of excavation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">820</ref> Only the Porta Marina and Nola have provided more secure identifications. The bust above the Porta Nola, albeit heavily damaged, still displays a few long curly locks extending from the base of her helmet that have provided its link to Minerva (fig. 41 and 50). The Porta Marina still includes an overt religious reference in the form of a large niche in its right forward bastion as one enters the city. Apart from a small podium and a rectangular frame, the niche is now largely devoid of embellishments, but white stucco completely covered it at the time of its excavation (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_54">120</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">821</ref> The reports describe the recovery of three large terracotta statue fragments and two smaller pieces of a hand associated with the shrine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">822</ref> Hermann von Rohden reunited the fragments in a drawing published in 1880, but they subsequently vanished into obscurity and were considered lost. <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">823</ref> As a result of these circumstances, scholars have largely ignored Minerva's connection to the fortifications and any wider associations she might have had with the protection of the city.</p><p>In the summer of 2010 the insight of the archives director at Pompeii, Dott.ssa Grete Stefani, led to the rediscovery of the Porta Marina Minerva. Although somewhat battered, the pieces unmistakably join into Von Rohden's reconstruction (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_55">121</ref>). The figure stands on her left leg in a gentle contrapposto pose with her right hand resting on her hip. She wears a sleeveless chiton, and a chlamys draped over her right shoulder and arm. The head is gone as is almost the entirety of her left side above the knee. Her left foot peeks through the drapery next to a stylized rock. It preserves an attachment that may be the remnant of a shield that once stood next to her leg. The trace of the shield is the only defining attribute that led to her identification with Minerva in her role as protectress of the fortifications. Von Rohden pointed out the exquisite workmanship of the piece and its Hellenistic character. Yet he was unable to date the statue on stylistic grounds because of its heavy damage. Instead, he dated it more broadly to a refurbishment of the gate based on the fact that the niche is an integral part of the masonry and was not cut into it at a later date. <ref type="bibr">824</ref> Scholars now consider this part of the gate to be part of a post-colonial refurbishment, but the statue may be a relic of an earlier phase. The statue is badly damaged, but its recovery context suggests that it broke and was put back into place sometime before the eruption. Despite her battered state she continued to stand vigil over the gate, suggesting a strong continuity with her role as protectress of the fortifications.</p><p>August Mau originally suggested that Minerva protecting the city gates in Pompeii was part of an overt Greek influence on the city and her role as Athena Polias.</p><p>824 Von Rohden, Die Terracotten von Pompeji, 44.</p><p>Phrygian Minerva as a pro-Roman cult originating in Tarentum in the fourth century BCE. <ref type="bibr">829</ref> A series of nearby sanctuaries at Stabia, Punta della Campanella and the site known as Località Bottaro, along with regional temples further south at Fratte, Tarentum, and Paestum, signal the importance of the cult. <ref type="bibr">830</ref> More importantly, the Athena and</p><p>Hercules antefixes recovered at Pompeii, Stabia, and Punta della Campanella were fashioned from the same molds, suggesting that the cult was part of an orchestrated political introduction in the region.</p><p>Scholars have identified the Nucerian league or a renascent Neapolis as financing the sanctuaries outside of Pompeii, motivated either by their new alliance with Rome, or a final assertion of local identity during the Samnite wars. <ref type="bibr">831</ref> For the Punta della Campanella Sanctuary, the most important in the bay, this effort may represent a distinct act of appropriation of a previous cult and, therefore, the region.

In a brief article, J.P. Morel even goes as far as connecting its foundation, and that of the Temple of Athena at</p><p>Pompeii, to a Neapolitan attempt to culturally appropriate the southern Bay of Naples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">833</ref> This early connection between the sanctuaries is difficult to trace with any further certainty. Nevertheless, the votive terracotta statuettes recovered in the sanctuaries associated with the Phrygian Minerva, including the temple at Pompeii, display remarkable similarities (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">123</ref>). The most common example shows a standing Athena wearing a Phrygian helmet; she braces a shield against her left leg, and in her right hand she holds a patera resting on a colonnette. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">834</ref> The popularity of the type has led some scholars to identify it as a copy of the cult statue at Punta della Campanella. The other recovered types need not concern us with the exception of a variant recovered at Paestum and Stabia where Minerva rests her right arm on her hip and holds a shield on her left side in a similar fashion to the Porta Marina example (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_58">124</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">835</ref> Although removed and in the Naples museum, a similar variant also appears in a fresco on the façade of the Shop of the Carpenters' procession (VI.7.8-11). The fresco shows carpenters carrying an effigy of Minerva on a bier in honor of her role as protectress of their trade. Only a fragment of the statue is visible, but enough remains to identify the goddess holding a patera in her right hand and a shield resting against her left leg (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_59">125</ref>). Scholars hypothesize that these depictions represent actual cult statues. The image on the bier may well reflect the Punta della Campanella or the Temple of Minerva statues, especially if the lowered patera on the statuettes is artistic shorthand for her extended arm. <ref type="bibr">836</ref> If anything, these close associations suggest that the Porta Marina statue was part of the wider regional Minerva cult that also protected Pompeii. Rather aptly this Minerva, amongst her traditional roles promoting fertility and artisanship, also protected navigation, a crucial activity for a port city like Pompeii. <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">837</ref> The placement of her sanctuary as a visual beacon in the bay and its strong association with the fortifications seems hardly accidental, and perhaps also explains a decline of the cult once the colonists appropriated Venus Pompeiana.</p><p>Nevertheless, the evidence suggests a distinct continuity of her cult at the gates and walls of the city perhaps due to her wider role as protectress of fortifications.</p><p>Elsewhere in the Roman world, the colony of Tarragona in modern Spain preserves a relief of Minerva on a defensive tower known as the Torre de San Magín, or Torre de Minerva, dating to the foundation of the colony in the early second century BCE. The material, a local lime-sandstone, and the style suggest that a local artist carved the relief. <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">838</ref> Only the bottom half survives, but it is enough to identify the figure as Minerva holding a lance and leaning on a shield decorated with a wolf's head (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">126</ref>). Its placement on the tower is a clear indication of Minerva's role as protectress of fortifications, but it also acted as a projection of romanitas upon the countryside and the city. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">839</ref> Another example comes from the Porta Romana at Ostia Antica where a life-size monumental marble sculpture of Minerva still survives. The statue includes her familiar attributes; she holds a shield decorated with a gorgon with her right hand, wears a helmet on her head, and two prominent wings spring from her back (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_61">127</ref>). The sculpture functioned as a type of caryatid in a monumental version of the gate built under Domitian, but it perhaps originally belonged to an earlier version built allegedly built by Cicero in the 63 BCE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">840</ref> In both phases she performed in her guise as protectress of the city gate. Incidentally, Cicero himself describes Minerva as custos urbis, or the protectress of the city of Rome, and Plutarch recounts how the orator dedicated a statue of her from his own home at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">841</ref> The evidence, scant as it may be, points to a strong continuous presence of Minerva protecting the walls at Pompeii. To some extent the cult is also traceable to the start of the Roman influence in Campania and Pompeii's alliance with Rome. The ruined state of the temple after the earthquake points to a reduced importance of the cult, and the city walls, in addition to some of the gates, were similarly in disrepair and used as a quarry. <ref type="bibr">842</ref> Much of the evidence is debatable and perhaps accidental as Athena/Minerva traditionally plays an important role as protectress of city walls. Nevertheless, her vigilance over the city and its gates provided a powerful reference point for Pompeii's inhabitants and the region. The pro-Roman inception of the Phrygian Minerva, however, led to the continuity and the strong association between Minerva and city walls. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Looking back, the conclusions we may gather from the evidence show a few consistent factors in the role of fortifications. Chief amongst these is that they played a central role in the determination of the city's identity throughout its history. Their sheer size, scale, and investment made them the largest public monument and a solid marker of the city. As a result, the population actively engaged in shaping and appropriating the structure as a reflection of their own social make-up and political status. In most basic terms the fortifications consistently provided an area of refuge setting a lowest common denominator of security to the population. This factor is most evident in early Pompeii when the fortifications responded to clear basic needs protecting the community: its people, magistrates, religious idols, and sources of sustenance. The placement of the settlement on a high strategic ridge controlling communication routes and overlooking the Sarno valley also projected and legitimized its power. The city walls essentially acted as a monument to territorial claims. The use of local construction materials in particular further strengthened the notion, connecting the fortifications directly to the landscape supporting the community. In addition, the physical proximity between the fortifications and the sanctuaries of the city symbolically strengthened the bond between the religious and martial elements protecting the community. These factors also further legitimized the power of the commissioners of the structures. The use of similar construction materials in both monument types visually stressed these statements: the walls acted as proud markers of independence to the population and those approaching by land or sea. These powerful elements also resonated throughout the settlement finding a direct correlation between the enceinte, the buildings it enclosed, the landscape, and the people it protected. These were critical elements to basic survival and translated into a distinct symbolic role for the defenses that helped define the image of the city throughout its history.</p><p>The degree to which the enceinte could forge a sense of security relates to its real and perceived effectiveness to neutralize the threat of war and the dangers of the The basic notions of protection, achievement, and independence were powerful concepts that translated into the enceinte as a stage for the community they enclosed.</p><p>They were a monument to the social structure that built them. The figures behind their construction manipulated and appropriated these messages as a legitimization of their own power and ambition. As a result their resonance with the urban framework is far from coincidental. From their earliest inception they established an architectural dialogue with the city clearly indicated in the aesthetic considerations at play beyond their purely military design. The most emphatic statements reside in the rusticated masonry socle and the use of limestone and tufa throughout the defenses. These are not subtle embellishments but massive statements of power, all the more evident in the implicit correlation between the appearance of elite housing, manicured avenues such as the via dell'Abbondanza, public buildings, and the city walls. Although the periodization remains somewhat unclear, the employment of such materials echoed the wealth and ambitions of the community. As a result, the fortifications mirrored the status quo and their role to preserve it from both internal and external threats. These factors also explain the acts of private euergetism on the city walls as a direct reflection of the elite's status as the patrons of civic order.

The excavations sought to understand the pappamonte wall found near Tower III and answer questions concerning the dating and phases of the fortifications. Ceramics recovered from the excavations dated the pappamonte wall to the first half of the sixth century BCE, and its destruction to the early decades of the fifth. De Caro also revisited Maiuri's 1929 results and excavated a small trench near the Porta Ercolano. By examining the stratigraphic relationships, De Caro proved that the pappamonte wall preceded the course of later enceintes. The results also allowed him to date the orthostate wall to a period spanning the late sixth and early fourth century BCE. This rather long time frame for the orthostate wall stems from a lack of datable materials, forcing a relative date hovering between the construction of the pappamonte and the Limestone enceintes. 110 Later in the decade Cristina Chiaramonte Trerè led another dig that exposed the curtain wall between Porta Nola and Tower VIII. Her results mirrored Maiuri's findings further west identifying post-62 CE earthquake debris dumps, and evidence of repairs.

In the early 1900s a new branch and station of the Circumvesuviana light rail built north of the city led to the development of the now abandoned entrance facility at the Porta Nola. It remained the main access point into the ruins until a new station, the current Pompeii/Villa dei Misteri stop on the Circumvesuviana line to Sorrento, opened in the 1930s. Only in 1948 did the new entrance near the amphitheater artificially bridge the city walls as a barrier into the city. 124 Since then the modern urban sprawl of the Bay of Naples has engulfed much of the surrounding territory. Throughout this process the fortifications continued to act as the conceptual marker of the city.

Ample evidence, further discussed in the next chapter, exists for the reconstruction of the fortifications after the foundation of the colony. The most prominent is the inscription celebrating the duumviri Cuspius T.F. and Loreius M.F. as restoring the walls and towers ofPompeii. 388  Both men were Roman settlers and served in office in the early years of the colony; their intervention probably relates to repairs needed on areas damaged during the Sullan siege of 89 BCE, but the full extent of the work is difficult to ascertain.389  Recent investigations point to the extensive use of opus incertum on the city walls after the Social War. The Japanese excavations conducted at Tower IX point to a large post-Social War reconstruction effort, including the full reconstruction of the building and twenty meters of adjacent western curtain wall.390    </figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_9"><figDesc>Clearly,Vibius valued both projects as worthy enough for his euergetism, as each equally contributed to the image of the city. Such euergetism on single towers or gates was common practice in the late second and first centuries BCE throughout Italy, and potentially complicates what scholars see as a single upgrade of the city walls at Pompeii into a multitude of events.408  Without further excavations however, we cannot venture further into this discussion as much of it would be speculative. Many of the gates are heavily damaged and a reconstruction of their original appearance and decorative ensembles runs into obstacles. With the exception of a few slivers of stucco on the inside of the vaults, any further decoration has almost completely vanished. Several clues reside in the various monographs dedicated to Pompeii, but they supply little information on the scheme of the vaults, and even less on any potential colors employed. The first scholar to describe the decorative stucco in any detail is Bechi, writing in 1851, shortly after the excavation of the Porta Stabia. He describes the vault as collapsed but decorated in the same white First-Style stucco as the current Porta Ercolano. 409 Unfortunately his description ends there. Predictably, considering his instrumental role in defining the four Roman painting Styles, the only author who actually mentions any color on the structures is August Mau. In the case of the Porta 407 Guzzo, Pompei.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_10"><figDesc>clue to the dynamic aspect of the gates comes from their function as surfaces upon which to paint notices during the Roman colony. The Porta Ercolano, Nola, and Marina once preserved painted election notices and announcements of gladiatorial games. Over time authorities covered the notices with thin layers of paint to keep the gates presentable and, to a certain extent; the structures functioned as dynamic billboards for those entering the city.414    Perhaps less conspicuous but equally important to civic décor is the proper drainage of sewage and rainwater from the streets of Pompeii. Even today the characteristic sudden downpours of the region can turn the streets into small torrents draining water from much of the city. All the gates on the down-slope side of Pompeii featured a drain through the agger that Maiuri dated to the establishment of the Roman colony. He based his observations on the fact that the drains at the Porta Stabia and Nola hindered access to the wall-walk and were therefore built in a period of peace when the walls fell into disuse.415  Although recent investigations confirm that the current version414  See CIL IV 1193 and CIL IV 1194.

The inlet is inconspicuous built in opus incertum to the left of the steps leading up to the wall-walk. The outlet on the opposite end, however, is actually rather grand sitting on a high base of limestone masonry built to match the lower courses of the curtain (fig.52). This striking aesthetic detail again highlights the desire to maintain the limestone/tufa framework present throughout the fortifications. The resulting petite bastion guided rainwater in a small cascade onto the road below, emphasizing the drainage of the via di Nola every time substantial rain hit the city. Although slightly less in the public eye, a similar water cascade drained beneath the engaged colonnade along the via dei Soprastanti and fell into the garden of the House of Maius Castricius (VII.16.17).417    Other drains through the gates are less clear in their physical remains and construction events. The Porta Nocera preserves a drain on its western flank that due to its relative height clearly predates the lowering of the road passing through it. It uses the inner wall of the gate court to define the course of the channel. Limestone blocks placed diagonally against the fortification create a triangular capping. The Porta Sarno also preserves a drain that channeled water from the via dell'Abbondanza through its northern flank. Not much of it remains but its position suggests that it similarly abutted the inner reinforcement of the gate court. A drain opening at the Porta Marina sits in a similar position just south of the gate and ceased to function when it disappeared behind the masonry of the Villa Imperiale.</figDesc></figure>

In Italy the Roman town of Falerii Novi and the Etruscan cities of Volterra and Perugia display the first known apotropaic deities on the voussoirs and keystones of gates.426  Dating mostly to the period of Roman conquest, scholars have also identified a distinct political motivation to the choice of the depicted deities. The Porta Marzia in Perugia, dating to the late third century BCE, is a clear example. Today only the upper façade remains of an arch that once spanned the via Amerina and honored the city's alliance with Rome signed around 241 BCE.427  The decoration features protective busts and an elaborate balustrade displaying the foundational twins of Perugia, Oncus and Aulestes, flanking Jupiter with their horses.

The first, described in detail by various authors due to their visibility throughout the history of the excavations, includes Towers X, XI, and XII (fig.56). They feature an entrance on the rear right side of the building opening up on two sets of stairs, one heading down to the first floor and the other ascending to the second floor on the left. This setup allows for arrow slits at the corner of the staircases further protecting the front and sides of the towers. The first floor is a wideopen barrel-vaulted chamber with an opening toward a corridor in the rear heading to the postern on the right side of the building. On the second floor two doors opened onto the wall-walk and a staircase in the back heads up toward the third floor.Group two includes Towers II, III, IV and VIII, where the right side entrance opens directly on the second floor and a staircase heads down to the first floor on the left (fig.59). This second group features a faux corridor in the rear of the first floor, mirroring the functional one accessing the postern in group one. The posterns of group two, present in Towers II, IV, and VIII, open directly onto the main first-floor chamber and the staircase layout precludes a flanking arrow slit set directly above the postern. Tower II features a high floating postern, suggesting a later lowering of the ground level around the building. Tower III, perhaps because of its height and inaccessibility, lacks a postern entirely, while Tower IV uniquely features a postern opening on the left flank. The position of this last postern is counterintuitive since all others offer sortieing infantry the and Porta Nola. The CTP 5 however contains its own errors, confusing the tower depicted in Reinicke, which is actually VII, with number VIII.Van der Poel, Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, 5, 88-90.  </figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_13"><figDesc>A short list of the public buildings involved easily highlights the dramatic shift of the urban layout. The Forum, the center of public life, sees the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo, and the addition of the sanctuary to Jupiter, the Basilica, the Comitium, a new two-story portico, and an opus caementicium pavement framed with tufa slabs. Further south and east the large theatre goes up along with the colonnades and tufa pavement of the Triangular Forum, the Samnite Palaestra, and the Stabian baths.464  Strikingly the colonnade in the Triangular Forum features limestone foundations and tufa columns in a construction technique similar to the city walls.The southwestern tip of the plateau sees the re-development of the sanctuary to Mefitis Fisica. As mentioned previously, Mefitis was a local Samnite goddess, and in the case of Pompeii, later appropriated and transformed into Venus Fisica Pompeiana after the installation of the colony.465  Recent excavations at the temple suggest two phases in the Samnite period: the first coinciding roughly to the limestone walls and the second to the late second century BCE. The results suggest that a tufa wall built during the first refurbishment acted as a terracing structure for both phases. This choice of material is probably related to the prestige of the sanctuary. The second temple was a grand concept imitating the great terraced sanctuaries of Praeneste, Tivoli, and Terracina, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale (fig.62). It signals the ambition of the Pompeian elite financing the building to join the architectural developments occurring on the Italian peninsula. A double terrace supported three porticoes surrounding a central temple with an open view</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_14"><figDesc>469  A stucco veneer, often arranged in the First-Style, or Incrustation Style, covered it in this period.The decorative style is best known for its popularity as brightly painted imitative marble panels in the homes of wealthy Pompeians between 200 and 80 BCE. Its application was often formulaic featuring a lower socle with a surmounting middle zone of drafted imitative orthostate blocks. An additional third zone with imitation ashlars ended with elaborate cornices near the roof. It was widely popular throughout the Greek world and spread to Italy in the third century BCE perhaps as part of trading contacts with the emporium on the island of Delos.470  The plainer white version often found a place on the façades of houses and tombs, and also featured prominently on many public buildings including the Basilica, and the Temples of Apollo and Jupiter in the Forum to name a few.471  In this context, the Style remained in use up to the eruption and became particularly popular during the Roman colony, where, as Laidlaw suggests, it perhaps also symbolized the notion of pietas, or the idea of duty toward the city and the state.472    The development of the Style is a matter of much debate, but it is clear that it originated in the eastern Mediterranean, more specifically Greece. Many scholars equate the imitative panels on the interior of buildings as part of a distinct desire of the house's patron to emulate the expensive marble paneling in the great palaces of the east. In this context the style carried aulic associations reflective of civic institutions and the eastern kings, essentially also expressing the connotations of power and the state. The First-Style on the exterior of buildings also imitated the marble and stone masonry of monumental civic buildings in ancient Greece. Vincent Bruno highlights the particular similarities between the Style and the masonry of Doric and Ionic temples. He points to the walls of the grand buildings on the Athenian Acropolis, such as the propylaia of Mnesicles and the Parthenon, as clear antecedents of the Style. Here the First-Style connected directly to the proper representation of public space, the state, civic duty, and carried religious associations.473  The widespread use of the First-Style throughout the Samnite period and the colony reflects similar ideals correlating to the proper representation of the city and its institutions. During the Augustan period in particular, it also reflected a wider symbolic return to the values and social mores of the Republic after the chaos of the first century BCE.474    </figDesc></figure>

Scholars have always seen the town as heading the Nucerian League, a loose federation of cities, including Pompeii, Herculaneum, Nola, and Stabia, brought together under the umbrella of the Samnite alfaterni tribes. The volume of scholarship that the notion of this league has generated is again impressive. Briefly summarized, much of it concerns the identification of the league's political structure and leadership, including the role of the meddices or magistrates. Scholars have identified the meddix tuticus as the head magistrate of the federal league, with the individual cities represented by local meddices, e.g. the meddix</figDesc></figure>

The first type, dating to the early second century BCE, features a coarser opus incertum and a solid base.531  The second is more intricate and almost identical to the towers in Pompeii (fig.66). The buildings had three floors with two doors opening on each side of the wall-walk and a rear access from the agger. The ground floor featured a vaulted chamber with an exit postern, while the elevation differed slightly with five and four windows on the second and third floors, as opposed to the four of Pompeian types. Excavations have confirmed a gabled roof aligned on the curtain embellished with acroteria matching those of the basilica at Pompeii. First-Style decorative stucco covered the masonry with identical measurements in the size of the imitative ashlars, and the triglyphs and metopes of the Doric frieze.532    </figDesc></figure>

If anything it poses some serious doubts to the notion suggesting a purely Italic origin of the agger design. A similar study on the Pompeian fortifications is still lacking.Scholars have largely neglected the extensive quarry marks on the masonry of the city walls and a detailed study would certainly shed more light on their construction.538    Common concepts of siege warfare influencing basic designs throughout the Hellenistic world compound the problem. For example, the L-shaped merlons of the Pompeian battlements find parallels at Chalcis and the attic fortress of Phyle in the Greek world, and at Wiesbaden, Wimpen, Altenstadt, Trier, and Avenches in the Roman west.539  Similarly, the gabled roofs of the towers at Pompeii and Nocera probably derive from Greek designs with the best surviving examples at sites such as Aigosthena and</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_19"><figDesc>missiles. Most authors point to the towers at Paestum as predecessors of the Pompeian and Nucerian designs. Their first phase dates probably to the foundation of the colony in the late fourth century BCE.543  The towers on the north side of the city stand on a solid base, and have similar openings on the wall-walk with a second floor above.Furthermore, recovered decorative elements, including fragments of a Doric frieze, and Corinthian pilaster capitals with unidentified central busts, attest to highly ornamented towers (fig.67). A recent theory suggests that these decorations are part of a refurbishment occurring in the early decades of the first century BCE pointing to further connections betweenPompeii, Nocera, and Paestum. 544    The evidence raises questions of design transmission which largely fall outside of the scope of our analysis. A few observations, however, are warranted. In the first century BCE many cities on the Italian peninsula engaged in fervent building activity. In the first decades, inscriptions attest that local magistrates of some twenty cities built or refurbished urban fortifications with the number rising to thirty-five at the close of the century.545  The inscription above Porta Nola confirms a similar local euergetism at work in Pompeii and it is clear that the towers of the city, along with the examples in Nocera, applied the latest in military architecture. Their design and construction required the technical expertise of highly skilled architects educated in the tactics of siege warfare. In my opinion, with both cities in close alliance with Rome, and the existence of the Nucerian league questionable, Roman engineers were probably involved in the designs.The wars in the east had exposed the Roman army to the sophistication of Hellenistic 543 I.

Similarly, beyond defensive necessities responding to the insecurity of the time, the drive to build towers probably responded to Hellenistic notions of a turreted city where fortifications completed its image.546  These aspects are all the more compelling if we consider the application of the First Style on the towers as symptomatic of the local Samnite community trying to legitimize its status along the lines of the ideal Hellenistic city.The extensive building program of the second century BCE attests to the desire to establish Pompeii as a city; its defenses certainly played no lesser part in constituting its image. This development occurred with a local Samnite elite exposed to Roman and Hellenistic traditions the extent of which remain difficult to quantify without further research on the golden age. Nevertheless, throughout the period the city walls, although monolithic and primarily military, connected with the city through the use of similar materials and subtle decorative additions. Their protective character translated naturally into the urban matrix by further highlighting the architectural landscape they enclosed. In this manner they very much acted as a crown, creating a constant visual reminder to those inside and outside their boundary of the city within. The walls also interacted socially, acquiring nicknames and acting as landmarks for navigation through the city. Politically they emphasized the piety of the elite and independence of the city, but also allowed for a measure of control on the local population. Their design and continuous upgrades stressed the awareness of the latest military precepts, projecting the power and 546 Also Gabba, "Urbanizzazione e rinnovamenti urbanistici nell'Italia centro-meridionale del I sec. a.C.," 96, 108.

They also carried a religious element emphasizing their role as the protectors of the community. In many ways, the evidence examined in this chapter points out that, like any other major monument, fortifications carried social, political, and religious meaning. These elements become clearer in the Roman period, when new kinds of evidence further highlight the deep connections between fortifications and the city.Chapter 5 The Roman Colony: Continuity and Appropriation of the Civic ImageThe previous chapters highlighted the multivalent meanings of the fortifications, but the nature of the evidence limited much of the analysis to the architectural comparison between the design and masonry of the walls with the city. These limits are less of a concern for the Roman colony since other types of evidence, such as surviving visual representations and a clear picture of the city's society, help to further contextualize the role of the walls. This chapter is therefore slightly different, focusing also on the wider social changes affecting the image of the city. The historical division afforded by the foundation of the colony is a very convenient one, but many notions related to the defenses, including civic pride and independence, remained true for the colony. The new colonial realities led to their negotiation and transformation in a process that continued up to the eruption of Vesuvius. Within this context the fortifications incorporated the essential Roman values of virtus, securitas, and dignitas which varied in importance as social and political changes affected the city. To some extent these notions undoubtedly carried over from the Samnite period, but like any other monument the meaning of the Pompeian fortifications changed with the developing realities. The history of colonial Pompeii traditionally divides into the late Republic, the early Empire, and the post-earthquake period from 62 CE to the eruption of Vesuvius. The changing roles of the fortifications consequently align with these events, but perceptions change gradually and it is precisely their continuous presence in the subsequent history of the city that made me treat them in a single chapter. During the Social War Pompeii joined the ranks of the cities revolting against Rome. Sullan forces besieged the city, capturing it either in 89-88 BCE or 82 BCE depending on the scholarly points of view. As a testament to the importance of the battle, Sulla himself led the siege after mutinous troops strangled the first Roman commander, Aulus Postumius Sabinus. 547 Powerful reminders of the battle still mark the city. Pockmarks in the masonry near the Porta Vesuvio and Ercolano attest to the violent bombardment of ballistae and catapult missiles. The eituns inscriptions still point the way</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_20"><figDesc>scholars have extensively discussed the original appearance and function of the Porta Ercolano. The current remains frame a large central roadway open to cart traffic with two smaller flanking pedestrian passageways on either side (fig.80). Barrel vaults covered the side passages, whereas the central bay, closed with a portcullis on the field side and double-doored gate on the city side, was open to the sky. The result was a typical open court gate. The ruined piers standing today still preserve parts of the First-Style embellishments that once covered the gate, but the elements have taken a heavy toll on the remains. Illustrations in Mazois and Rossini point out how much decorative detail has disappeared including a black socle emphasizing the passageways and two lost pilasters applied in low relief on the far corners of the building (fig.81). 629 Only Mau actually mentions the socle in print, describing it as a typical Augustan Third-Style variant of the 628 Until recently scholars believed that this version dated to the Augustan period, but a new convincing argument now puts its construction in the post-earthquake period.

Further developments, as we have seen, included the refurbishment of the Temple of Venus, and her transformation from the Samnite Mefitis Fisica into Venus Fisica Pompeiana.<ref type="bibr" target="#b130">700</ref> More subtle, but similarly symbolic works included the adaptation of the Temple of Jupiter in the Forum to accommodate the Capitoline triad, and the dedication of a new altar and staircase at the Temple of Apollo.<ref type="bibr" target="#b131">701</ref> These were public temples and the First-Style decoration applied on their exterior further highlights its role in the definition of the new colony. As opposed to the brightly painted private sanctuaries, the more somber white decorations were part of their official status. As we have seen, this aspect of the style finds its origin in the Greek Ionic and Doric architectural orders. Its continued application likely reflects the same notions associated with proper civic image that began in the Samnite period. Eric Moorman argues that the use of the First Style on temples relates to their role as houses of the gods and connects this context to its application on the exterior of private dwellings. The Temple of Jupiter therefore acquired a representative element befitting the image of the city as a new Roman colony. The same concept applies to the Temple of Apollo, where further repairs conducted in the late Julio-Claudian period included the reapplication of First-Style embellishments, attesting to the official status of the style well into the first century CE. The changes in the urban landscape, most notably in the buildings, transformed Pompeii into a late Republican colony and the First-Style exterior embellishments reflected its status.702    The houses seem to follow the same trend with some, but not all, of the distinctive tufa masonry façades disappearing beneath a thin coat of white stucco, in essence creating what the First-Style plaster was trying to achieve. Other wall faces in the city included smooth stucco on a brightly painted socle, similar to the internal vaults of the gates, or the full-fledged imitation of ashlar masonry (fig.94).703  These facades grew increasingly elaborate, and perhaps reflected the social prominence of the owner, with ornamental First-Style schemes including a low socle, surmounting ashlar zone, and door pilasters featuring tufa capitals either carved or stuccoed in the Corinthian order.704  It is unclear when exactly this type of decoration began in Pompeii, but it is likely a continuation from the previous Samnite period. In any event, the First Style as applied to house facades clearly was in dialogue with the exterior of public buildings, persisting throughout the colony to create a unified civic image.

It is important to our discussion because its placement created a direct architectural dialogue with the walls for the remainder ofPompeii's history (fig. 95). Dating roughly to 70 BCE, the dedicatory inscription tells us that the duoviri quinquennales C. Quinticius</figDesc></figure>

The fortifications formed an architectural backdrop carrying implicit messages to those attending the games. For visitors, especially those arriving from the Sarno plain to the south and east, the towers and walls set the stage for the amphitheater and city behind them. The spectators arrived through the Porta Sarno and the Porta Nocera, which symbolically marked the entrance into the colony and funneled them toward the new entertainment district (fig.96). The influx of crowds probably led to the lowering of the Porta Nocera since the road going through it connected directly to bridges over the Sarno River toward Stabia and Nocera. The works related to this lowering included cutting back the scarp in front of the walls, thereby exposing their foundations. Although the result effectively weakened the fortifications from a military perspective, the lowering added to their height and created a further impression of strength and impenetrability.724  Once one was inside Pompeii, Towers IV, V, and VI entirely framed the arena acting almost as an architectural crown as visitors approached the building. The upper platform of the amphitheater afforded spacious views of the region visually punctuated with tall towers defining the city and projecting its power onto the countryside. Inside the building spectators of the early colony likely sat according to military rank, which transitioned into an arrangement by class in the723  Welch, The Roman Amphitheatre: From its Origins to the Colosseum, 88-100. 724 Conticello de' Spagnolis, Il pons sarni di scafati e la via Nuceria-Pompeios 19-25.

The organization specialized in training young men to become ideal citizen soldiers who would demonstrate their skills in annual open drills known as the juvenalia. This festival perhaps took place inside the amphitheater, further strengthening the military connection and symbolism of the two buildings.730  The building probably also functioned as a porticus open for citizens and spectators to enjoy similar to those built by the new emperor in Rome.731  Although the benefactor of the building remains unknown, its role expressing the realities of the new empire is apparent.The western precinct wall displays diminutive merlons implicitly mirroring those of the city walls nearby (fig.97). They imparted the image of a fortress and acted as backdrop to the basic military training expected of young Romans. They symbolized the concept of virtus, or excellence and bravery of the individual, to those training within its grounds.732  This was a central Augustan ideal promoting the physical fitness and moral character of Roman citizens. Virtus, of course, was a much older concept and an essential quality in the character of the Roman aristocrat. It encompassed the characteristics of martial prowess including the individual skill at arms, the broader tactical insight, and the</figDesc></figure>

Although the towers display some repair work, the powerful messages the fortifications previously projected on the area lay in ruins. Starting in the early colonial period the amphitheater district changed symbolic roles from an explicit imposition reflecting the ideals of the new colony to an encompassing reflection of Roman order in the Augustan period. Throughout this period the city walls remained a constant presence translating their protective roles as reflections of civic institutions on the colonial and imperial city. From the original strong symbol of Samnite independence to the Roman appropriation and projection of the new social order, the meaning of the fortifications transformed along with the changing architectural landscape.</figDesc></figure>

In their wider meaning they acted as a small fortress alluding to the real fortifications nearby, protecting the tomb and the deceased within. Together with the stucco embellishments we again encounter the twin notions of virtus and citizenship permeating the funerary and military architecture of the city.CITY WALLS INTHE DOMESTIC SPHERE: REFLECTIONS OF URBAN AND SOCIAL IDEALS Beyond the correlations with civic architecture, Pompeii preserves evidence for the social performance of the city walls in the form of artistic expressions. These are important since they give us a glimpse into the visual conceptualization of city walls, and how select individuals perceived the fortifications in the wider context of the city where they lived. Images of city walls in Roman art are a well-known phenomenon and the object of much discussion. Broadly speaking, they follow a general trend from the late Republican and through the Imperial period where they become inextricably linked to the image of the ideal city and the establishment of Roman order. Paul Zanker describes the changing environment including the installation of colonies, roads, sanctuaries, tombs, and monuments as a reflection of a new ideal establishing order on the landscape. The Avezzano relief in particular, showing a city and its walls dominating the newly developed landscape, highlights its formation (fig. 104). 753 Such civic representations fall within a wider trend of establishing an urban model and the with the sphinx and Theban dead who failed its riddle lying below. A third relief depicted a reposing Theseus holding a club as trophy for the slaying of Corynetes. A fourth displayed a female figure holding a torch horizontally, probably representing a female mourner. See also the Tomb of Caius Fabius Secundus (süd 18).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_29"><figDesc>scholars to associate them with particular individuals. These associations are often rather doubtful. Nevertheless, they merit further discussion as evidence of how their owners engaged with the fortifications and recognized their symbolic roles.The House of M. Caesius Blandus preserves a prominent Second-Style example in the threshold between the fauces and the atrium. It is a fairly straightforward symmetrical rendition centered on a city gate flanked with curtain walls ending in a tower on either side (fig.111). The gate is vaulted and closed with a simple two-leafed door further fortified by a jagged crown and three exaggerated T-shaped merlons. The curtain sections are orthostate walls topped with smaller merlons. The towers each feature two large vaulted windows with surmounting crenellations. Shields above each curtain further stress the martial character of the panel. The threshold is part of a wider mosaic that spans the fauces. It includes a central rudder set before a trident and framed with dolphins. A sea dragon and a small bird perched on the rudder in the top right corner fill in the scene. The vertical composition of the mosaic acted as a guide leading spectators into the house, whereas the threshold, further highlighted by the closed gate, invited spectators to stop and appreciate the view of the atrium and the tablinum beyond.772  The combination of the two motifs is atypical for mosaics displaying fortifications and likely reflects an explicit commission connecting personally to the owner of the house. The rudder and trident clearly reference the sea and navigation, and they seem particularly apt for a port town like Pompeii. Both carried further associations; the trident was a symbol of Neptune, and the rudder was a prominent attribute of Venus Pompeiana. The bird on the trident may also represent a woodpecker that alluded to Mars in keeping with the martial character of the city walls and the shields.773  This mix of clues does not present a clear identification of the owner beyond his strong association with Pompeii and its maritime character. Yet, at the time of the mosaic's commission, Neptune was a god more popular in Rome than in Campania and his attribute suggests a pro-Roman affiliation of the owner of the house.<ref type="bibr" target="#b146">774</ref> Originally named the House of Mars and Venus because of the Fourth-Style medallions representing the two divinities throughout the house, the complex now receives its name from the graffiti scratched in the peristyle.

The artist used smaller ashlar masonry to denote the towers, perhaps in an effort to mimic the similar contrast between tower and wall curtain present in the Pompeian circuit. The representation of ashlar masonry, in particular, began in the late Republic and perhaps reflects the application of the First-Style used on the exterior of buildings.783    The towers have two stories with two windows on the first floor and three on the second.Two of them, each centrally placed before the tablinum and fauces, further highlight the entry axis into the house. The artist stressed their functional importance by subtly changing their aspect; the tablinum tower features only a second floor and no ashlar masonry, whereas the fauces tower includes a large vaulted opening. This open gateway further complements the role of the fauces where a scene detailing two dogs attacking a wild boar acted as an invitation for visitors to stop before entering the house.784    The mosaic and the electoral slogans on the façade enabled Matteo Della Corte to link the house to L. Coelius Caldus. He was a member of the Coelii whom he allegedly joined as a way to gain access to the local elite. The Coelii traced their ancestry to a Roman consul in 94 BCE, a quaestor in 50 BCE, and the general C. Coelius Caldus, who served as praetor in Hispania Citerior in 99 BCE where he participated in the siege of Clunia. According to Della Corte the mosaics of the atrium explicitly referenced the gens; the wild boar was a symbol of the Hispania Citerior, and the fortified enclosure</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_31"><figDesc>dell'Abbondanza axis near the Forum. As mentioned previously, these houses belonged to prominent early colonists, most likely high-ranking officers of the Roman army, who acquired them specifically for their visibility and proximity to the Forum as the political heart of the city. Interestingly, the new owner built an exedra in the back of the peristyle similar to one containing the Alexander Mosaic in the House of the Faun, suggesting his ambition to emulate the grand Samnite houses ofPompeii. 786    Although the commissioner of the atrium and fauces mosaics remains unknown, he probably belonged to an influential Pompeian family. Beyond their functional address and the apotropaic symbolism associated with the bands depicting city walls, the mosaics probably expressed the Roman identity and political affiliation of the owner. Their early Imperial date coincides with the period when city walls mosaics expressing romanitas reached the apex of their popularity in the Augustan colonial establishments of the Roman west.787  In this context the mosaic dialogued with the real fortifications of Pompeii as part of the Augustan political message. Its presence in the atrium further reinforced this statement since this was the space where the patron of the house met his clients on a daily basis.</figDesc></figure>

The central emblema depicts a gorgon head set between panels; one depicting a nautical scene and the other an image of a fortified circuit. The nautical panel displays a merchant ship and small support vessel moored onto a lighthouse. The opposing fortified circuit includes ten towers and is a semi-octagonal shape with a square protrusion reminiscent of the wider geometric pattern of the mosaic. An unidentified structure, perhaps a crude version of the tower gate found in the House of the Wild Boar, surmounts the walls to the right. It points toward a palm tree and two smaller subsidiary buildings identified as a possible sacellum outside of the circuit.</figDesc></figure>

As the focus of the riot, the amphitheater stands out as the largest structure, whereas the Palestra to the right is much smaller despite their almost equal size in real life. The artist deliberately represented only part of the velum and the masts holding it up to allow a full view of the action inside the arena.797  Further back the city walls frame the riot standing at roughly the same scale as the amphitheater to highlight their importance. A comparison to the actual appearance of the walls reveals a few glaring differences serving to emphasize their importance and stature. In an effort to suggest their length the artist dramatically curved the wall curtains and included two small posterns which, due to their position, might represent schematic depictions of the Porta Nocera and Sarno. The absence of the agger serves to visually isolate the arena and emphasize the ashlar masonry present on the exterior of the fortifications as their most recognizable aspect. As we have seen, the exterior curtain at the time was a medley of construction techniques and this representation emphasizes the796  See J.R. Clarke, Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans: Visual Representation and Non-Elite Viewers in Italy,100 B.C.-A.D. 315 (Berkeley, 2003), 154-156. The author also reconstructs the fresco within a wider composition that included flanking pairs of gladiators fighting on either side.797  On the masts holding up the velum see R. Graefe, Vela erunt: Die Zeltdächer der Römischen Theater und ähnlicher Anlagen (Mainz amRhein, 1979), 66-70.  wider visual conceptualization of the fortifications. Similarly, the towers stand frontally in the most directly recognizable view. Their appearance, with large open backdoors and four windows, is quite different from the real multistoried buildings.798  The First-Style embellishments are conspicuously absent, and the towers instead appear as plain white buildings. This element has the effect of differentiating them from the wall curtain in an effort perhaps to highlight their role in the area. The result is a wider recognizable external conceptualized view of the walls, emphasizing their architectural and symbolic roles, not only as a frame to the district, but also to the city and its citizens.Pompeii preserves one further representation of its fortifications on one of the reliefs from the lararium of Caecilius Jucundus (fig.117). The relief shows the effects of the 62 CE earthquake on the Porta Vesuvio with the open gate toppling over to one side, the intact castellum to its left, and the fortifications to the right. In the foreground panicked mules or bulls dart off to the right, and an altar next to a tree probably represents a sacellum outside the walls. Although found out of context, scholars have associated the relief to a lararium in the House of Caecilius Jucundus (V.1.26) where a second depiction in the same style portrays the effect of the earthquake on the Temple of Jupiter and an adjacent arch in the Forum.799    </figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_35"><figDesc>This continuity is in stark contrast to the development of Venus Pompeiana. Her specific Samnite origin probably motivated her appropriation. The placement of her temple carried a similar inherent symbolism to the Minerva and Hercules cult further along the ridge. Its refurbishment at the inception of the colony provided a powerful reminder and testament of allegiance to the new social order dominating the city. Her popularity and attributes attest to her continued intimate relationship with the populace and explains the refurbishment carried out under Augustus as a legitimization of his own power. This event is more compelling if we consider the rebellious history of the city and its Sullan colonial foundation as factors that imply the city's backing of Pompey against Caesar. Furthermore, the elaborate reconstruction of the temple underway at the time of the eruption attests to her continued symbolic importance. At any rate, two of Pompeii's most important deities find resonance in its city walls, serving as proud displays of its identity, and creating a strong sense of devotion, pride, security, and community amongst the populace for most of its history.The role of the city walls after the inception of the colony was as rich and full of symbolism as any other existing monument in Pompeii, and their significance changed in unison with the political and social landscape. The tensions of appropriation and continuity inherent with the establishment of the colony are evident in the religious landscape with the development of Venus Pompeiana and the preservation of Minerva's cult in the gates of the city. The Roman conquest immediately appropriated the fortifications, a strong symbol of independence in the Samnite period, and ushered in the new social order of the city. A continued emphasis on defense and their general association to the securitas and dignitas of the colony were factors that led to their reconstruction. In the Augustan period clear connections appeared with of the notion of virtus, although we cannot discount its previous presence in the symbolism of the walls.These concepts found further architectural resonance in the city as a reflection of the new order of the empire. Similar trends are present in the preserved art of the city where we catch a glimpse of the importance of the walls as a projection of romanitas right up to the eruption including in the views of a freedman such as Caecilius Jucundus. After the earthquake the fortifications acquired a new role, helping as massive quarries with the reconstruction of the city. However, they continued to function as a boundary marker and the imperial message found its voice in the reconstruction of the gates. The Porta Ercolano in particular was a new crown jewel of the city scape announcing the rebirth and reconstruction of Pompeii. Together these elements testify to a dynamic significance of the city walls throughout the colony, a role far more complex than their monolithic appearance tends to suggest.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_36"><figDesc>unknown "other." The community continuously upgraded the defenses to meet everchanging tactical and military developments. The use and adaptation of these technologies reflected the wealth and status of the community. It also symbolized its willingness to invest in the walls and Pompeii's connections at the forefront of the wider trends in martial architecture on the Italian peninsula and the Mediterranean. This consideration is especially important if an outside party aided in the design and financing of their construction. It inevitably stressed the strong relationship and bond between patron and client.The fortifications were therefore dynamic and up to date buildings despite their intrinsic massive monolithic character. As a result, their image transformed in unison with social and political changes affecting the community. In this context construction, reconstructions, and overhauls were acts of appropriation, but also efforts to preserve in memory the history of Pompeii. The interventions were symbolic markers on the inherent time capsule that the massive fortifications inevitably created as indicators of the antiquity and identity of Pompeii. This aspect is a natural translation of the continuous role the fortifications performed as territorial markers and their projection of power, domination, and security upon the population and the landscape. They were, in essence, the proud markers of what the population and their leaders claimed, built, and achieved.</figDesc></figure>

He particularly singles out the House of the Surgeon. Interestingly, his excavations in the house uncovered a rough stucco coating on the blocks set in the foundation trench of the two interior rooms. Maiuri uses this as further proof that the blocks clearly originated from another building. He does not elaborate further, but the discovery indirectly implies that the original orthostate wall included a stucco decoration. However, the blocks may also come from other buildings.</p></note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Similar connotations extend to a single Augustan phase to the castellum, although at this much later date associating it to a symbolic loss of independence is probably a lesser implication. Nevertheless, the partial burial of the fortifications carried similar symbolic mark upon the city, especially if we consider that that Temple of Venus also received a refurbishment in this phase. <ref type="bibr">619</ref> Perhaps the memory of the symbolism of the limestone and tufa juxtaposition had faded by this stage. However, the construction of the castellum, the piazza and the modification of the Porta Vesuvio, ties in with a more general emphasis on the city gates that falls in line, as we shall see, with the broader trends on the Italian peninsula. The new emphasis to the Porta Vesuvio, transformed it into an important landmark for the city. It would maintain this role through the rest of Pompeian history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Porta Stabia</head><p>On the opposite end of the city, the Porta Stabia received an opus incertum arch in the early colony and finally achieved the same appearance as the other gates in the city (fig. <ref type="figure">79</ref>). <ref type="bibr">620</ref> Until the recent excavations scholars commonly associated the vault with the construction of the towers, and we should keep in mind that future investigations may reveal more variations in construction events. If anything, the evidence of the Porta Nocera highlighted previously suggest a similar more complicated construction sequence.</p><p>The completion of the Porta Stabia vault at this late date is perhaps related to the construction of the nearby small theater. This building is commonly associated with the <ref type="bibr">619</ref> See below <ref type="bibr">620</ref> On the date see Devore and Ellis, "The Third Season of Excavations at VIII.7.1-15 and the Porta Stabia at Pompeii," 14. They essentially revive Bechi and Minervini's first belief that the vault represents a post-Sullan construction event. They, however, push it to postdating the earthquake of 62 CE. See Bechi, "Sommario degli scavamenti di Pompei eseguiti nel corso del mese di agosto 1851," 42.</p><p>Rome since the expenditures that accompanied the reconstruction effort likely came from the imperial coffers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">640</ref> It is unclear who financed the reconstruction; both Nero and Vespasian had further connections to the city. Nero was personally connected through his wife Poppaea, whose gens came from the Pompeii. He even dedicated a golden lamp to Venus Pompeiana as a symbol of his sponsorship to reconstruct her temple. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">641</ref> Vespasian's involvement in the post-earthquake period included the addition of a temple in his honor on the east side of the Forum. In fact, a recent re-evaluation points to his heavy involvement in the reconstruction of the city, to the extent that most of the public buildings were re-built by the time of the eruption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">642</ref> As discussed further below, he also ordered the restitution of all illegally occupied public land to the city including its walls.</p><p>The donation of the gates may therefore eminently express the completion of this process.</p><p>The lack of epigraphic evidence keeps us guessing whether Nero, Vespasian, or even Titus supplied funds for the reconstruction of the two gates. But we may draw a parallel to the specific choice of reconstructing these two gates with the commemorative arch of Augustus that simultaneously functioned as a gate in the enceinte of Rimini. The arch was one of a pair voted by the Senate in 27 BCE and it celebrated the completion of the Augustan renovations of the via Flaminia. Its twin marked the same event on the Milvian Bridge just outside of Rome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">643</ref> The monument also honored the massive renewal of the city's infrastructure after the emperor granted it colonial status as the pietas. Furthermore, the Hellenistic notions that included city walls in the definition of the ideal city, so influential in the previous Samnite period, probably also played a part in the decision to reconstruct the fortifications. Nevertheless, city walls were also intrinsic to Roman colonial identity. Early colonies often functioned as bridgeheads in dangerous enemy territory and were usually fortified as a result of their exposed position. <ref type="bibr">678</ref> Their strict Hippodamic layout reflected the plans of army camps and the walls projected an inward sense of security to citizens, and dominance upon local populations. <ref type="bibr">679</ref> Colonies also symbolically shared their plan with early Rome, also known as Roma Quadrata, or square <ref type="bibr">Rome. 680</ref> The elaborate sulcus primigenius ritual associated with the foundation of Rome also delineated the new colonies and created a symbolic connection to the legendary inception of the city. The crossing of the decumanus and cardo maximus, the main axial roads dominating colonial plans, usually accommodated the Forum and capitolium. From here surveyors laid out the city and the streets that extended into the regional road network connecting the heart of the colony to the outside world and to <ref type="bibr">Rome. 681</ref> It is within this framework that we must conceptualize the role of city gates and walls as a projection of Roman securitas and dignitas. These two concepts translate loosely to the security and dignity of the state and the walls, in essence, marked the differentiation between civilized and uncivilized, the urbs and ager. <ref type="bibr">682</ref> Although these ideas generally apply to city walls, they were particularly significant as part of the <ref type="bibr">678</ref> Cornell, "Warfare and Urbanization in Roman Italy," 126. <ref type="bibr">679</ref> Salomon, Roman Colonization under the Republic, 17 680 P. Gros, L'Architecture Romaine (Paris 1996), 33. 681 J. Rykwert, The Idea of a Town (Cambridge 1988), 137. Also P. Zanker, "The City as Symbol: Rome and the Creation of an Urban Image," 25-41. He explains that Roman roads allowed the urban image to incorporate the surrounding landscape since burial monuments, centuriation, villas and sanctuaries lined approach routes to the city and established dramatic backdrops to anyone approaching the urbs. <ref type="bibr">682</ref> Salomon, Roman Colonization under the Republic, 17 often lived beyond the confines of the cities and were identified as uncontrollable elements posing a danger to order. They were not subject to class distinction and took many forms in the Roman world including regular robbers, bandit and noble rebels, rivals, and avengers. 689 Spartacus forms a prime example of these elements, and, as we have seen, his presence in the region of Pompeii may have stimulated the initial reconstruction of the walls.</p><p>On a similar note, political adversaries, not necessarily bandits per se, posed serious threats to the established order especially when they concerned noble peers such as Catiline. His example points out how city walls functioned to symbolically protect the order of Roman society from the dangers of the 'other'. Thomas Habinek recently   discussed how Cicero's speeches condemned and exposed Catiline as a traitor conspiring against the state, essentially framing him as a dangerous outsider. His escape from Rome to join his army in the countryside near Fiesole further highlights the challenge to the established order of the city. Symbolically, the orator referred to city walls as forming the last line of defense protecting the civilized urbs, whereas the wild countryside harbored the improbabilities and dangers of disorder. 690 Such unpredictable forces were amongst the chief reasons communities first chose to defend themselves beyond immediate military concerns. <ref type="bibr">691</ref> Certainly the charged climate and multitude of political adversaries in the decades of the dying Republic emphasized the role of city walls as the guarantors of order and stability. The fortifications of Pompeii were still formidable enough to repel <ref type="bibr">689</ref> For a definition see T. Grünewald, Bandits in the Roman Empire: Myth and Reality (London; New York, 2004), 161-165. <ref type="bibr">690</ref> See T. Habinek, The Politics of Latin Literature Writing, Identity, and Empire in Ancient Rome (Princeton, 1998), 71-74. <ref type="bibr">691</ref> Rowlands, "Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements," 453.</p><p>Augustan age, thereby creating a microcosm of the Roman social order. <ref type="bibr">725</ref> In fact amphitheaters and their gladiatorial games in general would become venues of encased ritualized violence reflecting the brutality life and empire, and acting as agents of Romanization. <ref type="bibr">726</ref> In this role the fortifications surrounded the gladiatorial spectacles, in essence fights among animals and criminals, representing the very irrational forces the walls were also meant to keep out. The walls therefore further expressed the Roman character, or romanitas, of the city beyond their immediate associations with the proper image of the colony.</p><p>The amphitheater physically weakened the fortifications by demolishing the internal parapet and lowering the agger thereby isolating the towers. Nevertheless, they continued to play an important role in the defense of the city and its status quo. As evidenced above, engineers rebuilt the towers in conjunction with the amphitheater or soon thereafter as part of the general refurbishing of the walls. In this new context the walls continued to perform their usual outward defensive function, but also gained more complex practical and symbolic roles, including fulfilling a measure of crowd control.</p><p>The riot of 59 CE between the Nucerians and Pompeians at the amphitheater provides a powerful reminder of the dangers of large crowd gatherings. In the early colony the arrival of the veterans and their families created considerable social tensions.</p><p>Cicero's pro-Sulla speech clearly refers to a degree of mutual distrust between the local inhabitants and the new arrivals. <ref type="bibr">727</ref> In it Cicero defended Sulla's nephew Publius Cornelius Sulla, one of the founders of the colony, against the accusation of siding with <ref type="bibr">725 Zanker,</ref><ref type="bibr">Pompeii.

Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 120.</p><p>prominence of city walls underscores their association with the image of the ideal city in Roman art. The Augustan fresco recovered from the Tomb of the Statilii in Rome further exemplifies the concept. The pictorial sequence depicts the mythological foundation of Rome. In it soldiers build a city wall in two separate scenes symbolizing the mythical foundation of Lavinium and Alba Longa (fig. <ref type="figure">105</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">754</ref> In each image a goddess personifying the city looks upon workers toiling to build her wall. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">755</ref> Strikingly, despite the well-attested rituals associated with urban foundations, including that of Rome itself, the artist chose to depict the foundational act with the construction of defenses rather than any other symbolic moment. <ref type="bibr">756</ref> If anything, the scenes are a vivid representation of the mutual relationship between the deities protecting the walls and vice versa, expressing the same concept described earlier between the walls and temples of Pompeii.</p><p>In the Bay of Naples city walls appear prominently in harbor motifs where they serve as metaphors for refuge and security as a reflection of new man-made harbors often serving the new villas developing in the area. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">757</ref> Artists also used fortifications to depict the concept of the city, as opposed to the personified Tychai representing cities present in the eastern Mediterranean. Without analyzing every known depiction in Pompeii, two   examples in particular serve to highlight the point. The fresco of the Fall of Icarus in the House of the Sacerdos Amandus (I.7.7) still decorates the wall of a triclinium where it He argued that Juno would have been a more apt Roman cult since the Aeneid describes her role as the protectress of city gates. <ref type="bibr">825</ref> However, the picture is slightly more complicated, and the cult of Minerva, along with that of Apollo, was one of the oldest in the city. The Triangular Forum, where she had her temple, remained important up to the final days of the city and included a mundus and a heroon dedicated to the mythical but unknown founder of the city. The area saw some refurbishments in the Augustan and post-earthquake periods, but the Temple of Minerva lay in a symbolic ruin by the time of the eruption, reduced to a small cella housing the goddess. <ref type="bibr">826</ref> We have already noted the spectacular placement of the temple, its relationship with the neighboring fortification walls, and the consistent refurbishment of both occurring almost simultaneously (fig. <ref type="figure">122</ref>). The ruinous state of the temple may therefore be the result of a new emphasis on Venus Pompeiana after the foundation of the colony. <ref type="bibr">827</ref> The correlation perhaps extended further and new evidence suggests that the Minerva in the gate shrines linked to the Doric Temple. We have already noted the strong association of the Doric order with Minerva, since the masculinity of style was particularly apt to the valor of the goddess. <ref type="bibr">828</ref> In this context, the presence of the Doric friezes on the towers likely referenced Minerva in a similar way. If we assume a continuity of cult, the lower niche of the Porta Stabia gate court suggests a further direct connection between the temple and the fortifications. Little remains of the fourth-century Doric Temple, with the exception of a metope and a series of antefixes depicting Hercules and Minerva wearing a prominent Phrygian helmet.

		<title level="m" type="main">In addition, details such as the postern for Tower XII were not fully visible until Maiuri excavated the building in 1929. 582 Henry Wilkins, a contemporary of Gell, also renders stucco on the masonry west of Tower XII. He clearly delineates the opus quadratum near Porta Ercolano, but omits the current drainage spouts (fig. 75). 583 Publishing soon thereafter in 1825, Paul Fumagalli shows the masonry between Towers XI and XII completely covered in stucco. However, the rendition is again inaccurate since the stretch included naked opus quadratum masonry that the author describes in the associated text. 584 Le Riche similarly depicts completely smooth stucco on the opus incertum running west from Tower XII, but omits the stucco ashlars on the tower (fig. 75). 585 A vignette published by Breton in 1855 shows the area almost completely free of plaster; with a few remaining slivers suggesting it imitated ashlar masonry. 586 By the mid-nineteenth century, therefore, any stucco veneer in this stretch of the fortifications had likely disintegrated. The other section of opus incertum masonry frequently depicted in early illustrations is the eastern bastion of the Porta Nola</title>
