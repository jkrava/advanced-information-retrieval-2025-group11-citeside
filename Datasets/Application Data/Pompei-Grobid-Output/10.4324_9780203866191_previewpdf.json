Andrew Wallace-Hadrill is the Director of the British School at Rome and Professor of Classics at the University of Reading. Among his numerous publications on the Roman world, his 1994 book Houses and Society in Pompeii and Herculaneum won the James R. Wiseman award. He co-directs with Prof. Michael Fulford a project on Pompeii Regio I Insula 9. He is also director of the Herculaneum Conservation Project. Katherine E. Welch is Associate Professor of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, with her Ph.D. from the same institution. A specialist in Roman architecture, sculpture and painting, she is the winner of a Rome Prize and has been a Fellow of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Her publications range from studies of the Roman amphitheater to those of the art and architecture of Italy (particularly Rome), Greece and Asia Minor. Carroll William Westfall came to Notre Dame in 1998 as Frank Montana Professor and Chairman of the School of Architecture, serving as chairman until 2002. Earlier he taught at Amherst College, the University of Illinois in Chicago, and, after 1982, at the University of Virginia. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University. His initial work led to numerous articles and a book, In This Most Perfect Paradise (1974), a study of Early Renaissance Rome. His more recent studies of the relationship between the history, theory and practice of architecture are found in his contribution to the 1991 book Architectural Principles in the Age of Historicism written with Robert Jan van Pelt. His current focus is on tradition and classicism in architecture and the American city and the architect's capacity to nourish the Christian faith. -C o n t r i b u t o r sxxv P R E FA C E á‡¹á‡ºá‡¹ John J.

Our audience is the same as that of Mau and Kelsey, or at least the same as the Mau-Kelsey audience that we have observed during the last thirty years: scholars (especially Pompeii scholars); college and university teachers; students of archaeology; students in general enrolled in the ubiquitous courses on Pompeii taught at colleges and universities around the world; and the general public interested in learning more about Pompeii. This does not mean, however, that we present this book as \"the new Mau:\" far from it. August Mau's Pompeji in Leben und Kunst (Pompeii: its life and art, as translated by Francis W. Kelsey) was a unique creation of a single pioneer scholar, and a product of the late nineteenth century, just as our The World of Pompeii is a unique assemblage of essays by numerous scholars working at Pompeii in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. In many ways, this volume is as much an introduction to Pompeian studies as a study of Pompeii.",

      "text": "August Mau was born in Kiel in 1840; he died in Rome in 1909. Working out of the Deutsches ArchÃ¤ologisches Institut in Rome, Mau was introduced to Pompeii at a time when research at the site was becoming internationalized. His first publication, concerned with wall painting, appeared in 1873, and his record began to flourish in 1874, breaking through with his work on Overbeck's fourth edition of Pompeji (1884). 2 That encyclopedic treatment inspired his own effort fifteen years later. It was commissioned, as his own preface states, first in English. The English translation was accomplished by Francis W. Kelsey, who was born in Ogden, New York, in 1858 xxvii and died in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1927. Kelsey had been Professor of Latin Language and Literature at the University of Michigan for ten years before Pompeii: its life and art came out. He went on to enjoy one of the most distinguished careers in classical archaeology. Kelsey was working on his own grand treatment of Pompeii at the time of his death; it may be apt in some small way that both editors began their careers as graduate students in the building that bears his name, the Kelsey Museum of Art and Archaeology at Michigan. 3 Mau's ability to synthesize the information available to him in a detailed and compelling manner has proved hard to match. In addition, given the advances made in the century since Mau's publication, it seems well-nigh impossible for one or even two individuals to comparably distill over 250 years of work in multiple languages, at the oldest continually excavated set of sites in the world, using about the same number of pages that Mau and Kelsey had. Our approach had to be different. We decided to invite scholars from around the world (Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States) to contribute chapters which, when compiled, might form the book we wished to have on our shelves as the \"first to consult.\"",

Meanwhile, we have tried to ensure that references are sufficiently detailed to allow readers to pick their way through that long tradition of scholarship and reach the sources of the evidence if they so choose.

Neal Abraham arranged for additional time to work on the project. Sean Lockwood of the University of Cincinnati and Elise Friedland of Rollins College provided valuable assistance as well. I thank them all. 7 Pedar and I (along with authors Clayton Fant and Ann Koloski-Ostrow, and translator Maureen B. Fant) were graduate students of John D'Arms at the University of Michigan. In his final years John was President of the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) and his limited and precious research time was spent at the American Academy in Rome. On our last encounter I was examining the ambiguities and potential implications of Cicero's brief comment on Pompeii in Pro Sulla 60-62. Knowing that John was working at a nearby desk, and realizing that for their whole lives professors are connected to their former students, I invaded his research time with questions about Pro Sulla. At the time I appreciated our brief exchanges on a Pompeii topic in the stacks of the American Academy, and now I cherish them all the more. Thank you for much, John D'Arms (John Dobbins, ed.). 8 Jos DeWaele visited the University of Virginia once to deliver a lecture and he and I overlapped once in our research in Pompeii. His personal charisma and professional generosity revealed themselves on both occasions. I regret that my encounters with him were so few (John Dobbins, ed.). I n 310 BC, during the second Samnite war, the Romans and their naval allies carried out a raid against Nuceria.

The southern necropolis outside Porta Nocera follows the orientation of the road to Nuceria, which, on the way, crossed the ancient course of the river Sarno at Scafati.

As D'Arms 2 has already pointed out, we do not in any case know the respective size or the relationship between buildings and fields; for Villa Regina, an area between three and eight iugera of vineyards has been calculated on the basis of the capacity of the dolia (Figures 1.1,28.4,28.5). Most of the buildings have rustic rooms, few with frescoed decorations, a sign that the presence of the owner was probably occasional. Sometimes the decoration is quite costly, as in the \"tablinum\" of the farm at Carmiano 1963, with a Third-Style Bacchic scene; or at Terzigno (Boccia al Mauro), with Second-Style megalographic paintings (1997 excavations). There are plenty of simple decorations that allude to the tutelary gods of the harvest, as in the farm of Villa Regina at Boscoreale; and signs of Egyptian cults, as in the Villa of Agrippa Postumus at Boscotrecase (Figure 28.1,no. 31).",

Farther from the city are the so-called villa of the Poppaei, at Oplontis (Figures 1.2,31.5), and that of San Marco at Stabiae, more recent than the destruction of that city by Sulla. Less well preserved, but of equal importance, is the villa at contrada Sora, Torre del Greco, from which come the relief with Orpheus and Eurydice, a replica of Praxiteles' Satyr Pouring, and a bronze of Hercules and the stag (the latter two in the Palermo museum). The villas situated inland, from that \"of the Mysteries\" to those attributed to P. Fannius Synistor, N. Popidius Florus (at Boscoreale), to Agrippa Postumus (at Boscotrecase), also include a rustica part, showing that they have combined two functions.

To make matters worse, the damage inflicted by the series of earthquakes preceding the eruption (of which at least that of AD 62 is known) will have brought about even more buying and selling. The fertility of the soils and the favorable opportunities for trade caused the Pompeian countryside to be densely populated: Pliny records how enormous crowds from the farms took refuge at Stabiae, seeking to escape in boats.",
