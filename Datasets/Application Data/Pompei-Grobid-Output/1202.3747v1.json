Experts have used this collection to study the structure of Roman households, exploring the distribution and variability of tasks in architectural spaces, but such approaches are necessarily affected by modern cultural assumptions. In this study we present a data-driven approach to household archeology, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem. This approach scales to large data sets and provides a more objective complement to human interpretation.",

      "text": "Over the past century the goal of archeology has shifted from finding objects of artistic value to reconstructing the details of day-to-day life in ancient cultures. Reconstructing daily life is difficult as the evidence that would be useful was generally considered commonplace and unworthy of preservation by people at the time. Objects are gradually moved or disposed of; structures are renovated, repurposed or recycled for building materials. These ongoing processes make it difficult to make statements about specific points in time based on material evidence. A remarkable exception to this pattern is the Roman city of Pompeii in southern Italy, which was was covered in volcanic ash during an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD. As a result of its sudden, violent destruction, many aspects of day-to-day life in first-century Roman Italy were preserved in place as they existed on a particular day.",

      "text": "The study of Pompeian households has until recently been dominated by analyses of architectural patterns and wall paintings, as these are easily available for study. Only in the past few years has a database of objects, which are removed for conservation immediately upon excavation, been compiled and made available by Allison [2]. This database, which is available online, 1 contains more than 6000 artifact records for finds in 30 architecturally similar \"atrium-style\" houses in Pompeii. For each artifact, the database specifies a type from 240 typological categories (coin, amphora, etc.) and a find location from 574 rooms. Allison has used data about artifacts in their original context to challenge many common assumptions about the function of particular types of object, the use of particular spaces, and the consistency of patterns of use across different houses. The relatively large amount of archeological information compiled in the Pompeian households database supports the application of statistical data mining tools. In this paper we apply one such tool, Bayesian mixed-membership modeling, in which rooms are modeled as having mixtures of functions, and functions are modeled as distributions over a \"vocabulary\" of object types. Mixed-membership models have previously been applied to a broad range of inference problems in applications such as population genetics [10], text mining [3] and social network analysis [1]. We show that mixed-membership models both address several theoretical problems with simpler clustering methods and also provide improved predictive ability. Compared with a trained archaeologist, such models are naive and simplistic, but they have the advantage that they do not bring preconceived notions about culture along with them. As a demonstration, after assessing the model's predictive ability we consider several issues raised by Allison, and attempt to provide a perspective that is, if not unbiased, at least mathematically concrete in its biases.",

Second, mixed membership models allow individual groups of observations to combine multiple \"components\" such as topics or activities, while simultaneously allowing any observed dimension, such as a word or artifact type, to be generated with non-zero probability by any component. Finally, using the multinomial event model rather than the binary event model allows us to take into account the number of times an artifact type occurs, rather than the simple fact that that type is present. For example, a single loom weight by itself might be absorbed into the functional group of other objects in the same room, while a group of 15 loom weights provides substantial evidence that a functional group with high probability of generating loom weights is active.",

Due to small sample sizes, it may be possible for two related items to never appear together in a room purely by chance. In order to reduce bias of both kinds, we explore the function of these artifact types using only cooccurrence data, without any reference to the actual typology of the objects. We use the functional group mixedmembership model to detect clusters of object cooccurrence that may indicate functions. Note that we are still dependent on experts to classify physical objects into appropriate categories, but given those classifications we make no further archeological assumptions in training the model. At the same time, we expect that if two artifact types a 1 and a 2 appear with artifacts a 3 , a 4 and a 5 , all five objects will tend to be placed in the same functional group, even if a 1 and a 2 never occur together.",

Much of the study of Pompeian households has involved identifying categories of rooms and assigning functions to them.

For example, the atrium is often described as a formal space, in which the pater familias received his clients and distributed gifts from a large metal chest. Allison argues that the atrium was more of a utilitarian, industrial space. Similarly, a closed room off the atrium is described as a cubiculum (\"bedroom\"), but there is little evidence that these rooms correspond to modern concepts of bedrooms.",
