The diachronic nature of the deposits are examined in order to study the exploitation of the natural resources as the city develops, while the analysis of two spatially disparate dwellings allows a house in the heart of the 'old city' to be compared to a house close to the city walls . The disposal of domestic waste is also studied and finally the use of food in the ritual lives of the inhabitants of these houses is analysed.",

The Anglo-American Project in Pompeii has been recording the standing remains and undertaking stratigraphic excavation here since 1995. Secondly, the House of the Wedding of Hercules (VII. 9.47) is close to the central forum area and is being excavated by the University of Rome. Both of these houses had developed into large and elaborate properties by the time of the AD 79 eruption and both were clearly the homes of wealthy Pompeian families (e.g. D. Robinson forthcoming; Jones and Robinson 1998). Environmental data from two distinct phases in the lives of the two properties were analysed (phases 2 and 3) (Carafa 1997). In the House of the Wedding of Hercules, phase 2 (from the 4th to the first half of the 2 nd century BC) relates to the early Hellenistic house, while phase 3 (from the second half of the 2 nd century BC) sees the development of the typical atrium house. The environmental data from the House of the Vestals mainly relate to this later phase, with the exception of an earlier (phase 2) ritual deposit.",

From here the majority of the faunal remains was retrieved. In addition, a sample of every uncontaminated context was screened using a modified Ankara-style flotation tank. This systematic flotation process was responsible for the recovery of the majority of fish bones and the carbonised and mineralized plant remains. Conversely the strategy of retrieval at the House of the Wedding of Hercules was somewhat less intensive. No systematic on-site screening was undertaken, but large-scale flotation was possible. The difference in retrieval strategies has affected the faunal assemblages in particular and the implications of this are considered in the following interpretations.",

At the House of the Wedding of Hercules a cesspit dates to phase 2 and 3, while at the House of the Vestals several drains have been assigned to phase 3. The plant remains recovered from both types of context are preserved as mineralized remains and this suggests that varying states of preservation should not be a factor. In addition, as both types of deposit resulted from the same depositional processes (essentially cess), it is hoped that the plant assemblages from both households are a true reflection of the food consumed by the occupants. A direct comparison of the species present in phase 2 and 3 deposits from the House of the Wedding of Hercules, with those from phase 3 deposits from the House of the Vestals, should stress changes in the use of plants over time, as well as variations between the two households.",

Quantitative data have not been considered as the relative importance of the various species between samples is strongly affected by preservation factors (Ciaraldi forthcoming;Green 1979). Instead the presence/absence of species allows an immediate comparison to be made. Clearly the assemblage from the House of the Vestals presents a greater range of spices and fruits than was recovered from the deposits at the House of the Wedding of Hercules. This indicates a wider availability of food resources at the House of the Vestals and may reflect the wealth of the occupants of this house (for archaeological evidence see Jones and Robinson 1998) or more generally an increase in the range of produce avai lable in the city by phase 3.",

      "text": "A predominance of millet (Panicum miliaceum) in the cereals present in a phase 2 cesspit from the House of the Wedding of Hercules was particularly noteworthy. This is in contrast to the almost complete absence of millet from phase 3 deposits from the House of the Vestals. The dearth of millet from the House of the Vestals may indicate a significant difference between the two assemblages, especially as in later periods millet was considered to be a food of the poor (Pliny NH xviii.!I7). The change in the frequency of millet between the two phases and the two houses, however, can be interpreted in various ways . It could either represent a shift in the economic significance of this species (with a decline in the importance of this crop), or alternatively a difference in the wealth of the occupants of the two households at two different stages in their history. Rubbish deposits found at the House of the Wedding of Hercules (phase 2) also indicate the presence of millet. This millet is always associated with barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (both free-threshing (Triticum sp.) and emmer (Triticum dicoccum) and another species of millet, Italian millet (Setaria italica). The plant assemblage recovered from these rubbish pits also reveals a common association between cereal grains and chaff, in particular emmer glume bases. In contrast, chaff is absent from later contexts and this is true for both houses. The presence of chaff generally indicates that part of the crop processing of cereals was occurring close by. Its subsequent absence from later deposits in Pompeii represents a shift in the location of crop processing away from these houses, probably to the many villae rusticae where cereals were produced or to the numerous bakeries of Pompeii. A similar interpretation has also been made for the plant assemblages recovered from the excavations of 1.9.11-12 (Robinson 1999).",

As retrieval at the House of the Vestals was 'near-total', fish bones and scales dominated this assemblage and indicated that this marine resource was commonly consumed (Richardson 1995:27). Conversely the recovery of fish remains from the House of the Wedding of Hercules was so poor that direct comparisons were extremely difficult. Instead the faunal analysis concentrates on the consumption of the four main domesticates, cattle, sheep(/goat), pig and chicken. The few dog and horse bones that were retrieved probably represent the remains of working animals and certainly no butchery marks were seen. The wall paintings and mosaics of Pompeii suggest that dogs were kept for hunting and guarding, while horses (mules and donkeys) were used for riding and to pull carts and turn mills (Richardson et al. 1997:94-96).",

These indicate a change in diet over time with a relative increase in the percentage of pig and a decline in cattle and chicken (figure 3). interestingly, the faunal data from phase 3 deposits from the House of the Vestals are very similar to phase 3 at the House of the Wedding of Hercules (cf. figure 3 and 4). The only difference is a higher proportion of chicken bones at the House of the Vestals and this probably reflects the more comprehensive retrieval strategy at this site. Perhaps by phase 3 there was no difference in ability of these two households to procure a wide range of plant and animal foodstuffs. Using the proportions of domestic animals to determine dietary status is extremely difficult, if not impossible. An indication of high status consumption, however, may be identified by the slaughter patterns calculated from epiphyseal fusion and dental eruption and wear data. The slaughter patterns identified for pigs and sheep are similar from both properties. Over 80% of the pigs from both households were slaughtered as juveniles or young adults. The age data for sheep also indicate a widespread slaughter of juveniles, with significant numbers killed in their first year and the majority of animals dead by the end of their second year. These juvenile pigs and sheep indicate that prime pork and lamb were the preferred meats and, in part, corroborate the literary references to suckling pig as a Roman delicacy (cf. Columella VII.9.4). They suggest that the inhabitants of both the House of the Vestals and the House of the Wedding of Hercules had no need to consume poor quality meat from old animals and instead enjoyed diets of some status.",

Instead the most cumbersome bones of the largest species, . in this case cattle, are absent. Although the paucity of cattle bones may reflect food preferences, the systematic collection and removal of these large bones may also have occurred. The few cattle bones that have been retrieved tend to be the smaller bones from the lower legs and feet. This is not a product of the ease of identification, however, as very few 'cattle-sized' long bone fragments have been recorded . As this phenomenon cannot be explained by taphonomic bias, human activity is indicated. Although the possibility of leather-working cannot be discounted entirely (the lower leg bones may have entered the house attached to hides), an efficient means of rubbish disposal within the city would explain this retrieval pattern .

Perhaps a more formalised system of rubbish removal was in operation, at least collecting waste from the elite houses of Pompeii. Literary references certainly indicate that a rubbish collection and street cleaning service was in operation in Rome, with carts being used to take away all kinds of refuse (Tacitus, Annates 11.32; Valerius Maximus 1.7).",

Votive plant remains from phase 2 and 3 contexts from both houses are recorded in table I and it is interesting that the later ritual deposits contain a significant number of new plant species, including date, carob and pine cones. A phase 3 deposit from the House of the Wedding of Hercules also included mineralized poppy seed cake and a carbonised ring-shaped biscuit. A similar change in the plant composition of earlier and later ritual deposits has been recognised from the excavations of the House of Amarantus (I.9.II-12) (Robinson 1999).",
