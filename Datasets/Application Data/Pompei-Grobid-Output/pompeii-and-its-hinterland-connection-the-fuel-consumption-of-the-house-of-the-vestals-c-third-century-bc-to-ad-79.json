        "text": "Bio-archaeological studies can contribute significantly to understanding the economic interactions between cities and their hinterland. In Pompeii, where research has often been intramurally focussed, analysis of biological remains is often confined to bones and macro-botanicals consumed as foodstuffs. Charcoal, if collected, often remains unexamined, and yet this material is key to understanding the fuel economy of a city. This study has two goals: first, to describe an efficient method for charcoal sampling and analysis in a dense urban environment using only dry-sieved charcoals above 5 mm; and, second, in doing so, to demonstrate the dependent relationship between Pompeii and its hinterland for the provision of fuel in a case study from the House of the Vestals. A pilot study of 25 contexts from six 'rooms' and 750 charcoal fragments was followed by an extended study of 62 contexts over 14 rooms (a total of 1579 charcoal fragments). The extended results identified only two further (minor) taxa (represented by only three fragments). The most important wood identified was beech ( Fagus sylvatica), which constituted 50-75 per cent of the fuel supply, depending on the time period. Beech grows preferentially above about 900 m in central and southern Italy. Pompeii lies at 30 m altitude with the nearest mountain areas at least 15 km away. The study suggests that a methodology that relies on collection of charcoal from routine dry sieving (5 mm grid), in soils where this is possible, can provide robust results in a cost effective manner in an urban setting.",

      "text": "The city of Pompeii, which lies 50 km south of the Italian city of Naples, was buried by ash during the Vesuvian eruption of AD 79. In the last twenty years, comprehensive multidisciplinary excavations have commenced below the AD 79 horizon. Some of these have included publication of bioarchaeological remains (Fulford & Wallace-Hadrill, 1999;Auricchio, 2001: 172-73;Ciarallo & De Carolis, 2001;Murphy et al., 2012). Of the limited archaeological studies of charcoal in Pompeii, Castelletti (1984) examined a small charcoal assemblage from one context in the archaic period. Jashemski (2002) found small quantities of charcoal in garden soils (but these were not identified). More recently, as part of a tomb study near Porta Nocera (van Andringa & Lepetz, 2007), macro plant remains associated with burial, cremation, and subsequent ritual have been reported (Matterne & Derreumaux, 2008), as well as the charcoals (Coubray, 2012). The Anglo-American Project in Pompeii (AAPP) (Universities of Bradford and Stanford, and later, the University of Oxford), completed excavation of an entire insula of the city (Regione VI insula 1) from 1995 to 2006. The excavation of the House of the Vestals was finalized in 2000. In the House, as in the rest of the insula, near complete recovery of all artefacts and ecofacts was carried out by a team of around 100 staff, students and specialists in twelve 5-week seasons. Excavation on this scale has produced a large amount of material, including charcoal remains.",

      "text": "Pompeii is located near the Tyrrhenian Sea on the mouth of the river Sarno, in the fertile Campanian plain (Figure 1). Trace remains of the early Iron Age Italic peoples have been found and evidence for both Greek and Etruscan influence exists for the period from the eighth to the sixth centuries BC, culminating in the construction of the city walls. In the fourth century, an Italic people identified as the 'Samnites' who originated from the Apennines, descended from the mountains, gradually dominating the cities of the plain, including Pompeii (Wallace-Hadrill, 1998: 21). Rome began her ascendancy over the next couple of centuries and gradually took over the Italian peninsula. The city of Pompeii was besieged by the Roman general Sulla in the first century BC, and became a Roman colony in 80 BC. The coast was considerably further inland than today (Mastroroberto, 1990: 10), and probably less than 1 km from the city of Pompeii (Pescatore et al., 2001). The Campanian plain is low-lying, with some parts below sea level, and thus areas around the Sarno were prone to flooding. Pompeii is set on the only landform of any height (at 30 m altitude), on a small, ancient lava plateau (Stefani, 1990: 11). Ecologically, the Mediterranean climate consists of hot dry summers and mild winters, although microclimate variation is considerable (Grove & Rackham, 2001: 24-25, 57). From pollen studies in areas a little distant, including Lake Avernus (GrÃ¼ger et al., 2002: 240-73), the Bay of Naples (Allevato et al., 2010), the Bay of Salerno (Ermolli & di Pasquale, 2002: 211-19;Di Donato et al., 2008), and a small local study (Dimbleby & GrÃ¼ger, 2002: 181-216), the historic arboreal and agricultural conditions may be reconstructed. Cold climate trees that typically exist at lower altitudes in northern Europe were restricted to the mountainous areas delineating the Campanian plain, i.e. Mt. Vesuvius (volcanic soil), the central Apennine range and the Lattari Mountains (both calcareous). Examples of such taxa include Abies alba (alpine fir, or silver fir), above 1000 m, and Fagus sylvatica (beech), from about 800 to 1000 m (Pignatti, 2003: 112). These three taxa are now reasonably rare in the mountain areas surrounding the plain due to anthropogenic pressures (Grove & Rackham, 2001: 159;Ciarallo, 2002: 174). European Larix sp. (larch) does not occur naturally in Southern Italy, and Picea sp. (spruce), while being present in much earlier time periods (c. 14,000 BC), had disappeared by the classical period. The mid-montane altitudes, 400-800 m, were thought to have been dominated by mixed deciduous forests of Quercus spp. (oak), Castanea sativa (chestnut), Fraxinus sp. (ash), Ulmus spp. (elms), Acer spp. (maples), and members of the closely related Corylaceae Family: Carpinus spp. (hornbeams), Ostrya carpinifolia (hop hornbeam) and Corylus avellana (hazel).",

Riverine species such as types of Alnus spp. (alder), and members of the Saliceae family-Salix spp. (willow) and Populus spp. (poplar)-in ancient times would have commonly spread along the river flats, wherever agriculture did not occupy the fertile soil of Campania Felix. On the lower montane areas, and woodland margins, more degraded forms of forest may also have occurred, i.e. macchia (Foss et al., 2002: 66). Taxa from this environment include Erica arborea (tree heather), Arbutus unedo (strawberry tree), Pistacia spp. (pistachio), and, close by on the coast, various types of Pinus spp. (pine) and Cupressus sempervirens (cypress). Some macchia species such as Pistacia spp. and Arbutus spp. were also grown for commercial and medicinal use (as attested in the ancient sources, in particular, Pliny the Elder's Natural History), and were likely cultivated to some extent in city gardens and orchards.",

Between the fourth and second centuries BC, a small house of a few rooms developed on the via Consolare side of the insula. A (primary) foundation deposit (c. 200 BC) was sealed around the time of the commencement of the later house in an area under the southeast edge of the atrium. (This charcoal is to be reported separately.) In the second century BC, the House of the Vestals was extended across the insula, and in the first century, after the Sullan siege and subsequent Roman political takeover in 80 BC, all buildings were combined to form one luxury dwelling with two peristyles and even a small swimming pool in the Augustan period. Following the eruption of Vesuvius and burial in pumice and ash, the area was left dormant. Bourbon excavations in the eighteenth century caused disturbance to some parts of VI.1, and trampling by tourists and excavators alike has also occurred.",

The charcoal data that were obtainable were mostly from undifferentiated secondary fills, especially from the kitchen areas, but none of these were true primary deposits. Individual deposits represent the average wood use of a limited area over the given time period each context represents (according to standard ceramic typologies and coins in this period). Secondary deposits provide the greatest likelihood of evidencing 'average' fuel use. It is a difficulty in some charcoal studies that primary contexts are privileged (which attest to the last, or last few, burn events), and that they conflate results for primary and secondary contexts, and/or employ several different recovery and sampling methods in one study.",

      "text": "In a dense urban environment such as Pompeii, archaeological priorities of defining standing remains, usually by 'room', and analysing ceramics and coins and other artefacts, dominate collection strategies for environmental remains. The associated archaeological practices differ somewhat from prehistoric site excavations, where flotation of standard soil samples forms the kernel of recovery of bio-archaeological remains (either on a randomized, systematic basis, or by way of selection of contexts of interestor, potentially, both). The AAPP recovery strategy aimed at near total recovery of all remains, in that all excavated soils were dry-sieved to recover artefacts and ecofacts above the sieve size (5-mm grid). Additionally, from all excavated contexts, an un-sieved sample of soil was processed by flotation (a 20-l sub-sample, i.e. two 'buckets,' or less, if the context was smaller). This meant that specialists had at their disposal the dry-sieved (above 5 mm) remains, and the floated (above 500 microns) remains for every single context (some 5000 contexts in total for the House of the Vestals). Far more material was recovered than could be analysed. For the purposes of this study, a small informal investigation was carried out comparing the results of the two recovery methods. Initial comparisons of taxon diversity from flotation and taxon diversity from excavation/dry sieving, for charcoal from the same contexts, showed a loss of diversity from flotation. Taxa recovered from flotation were invariably the major hardwoods (which better survive the mechanical stresses involved). This result is at odds with the most commonly accepted beliefs about recovery approaches for charcoal. In general, flotation is accepted, mostly unquestioningly, as being a superior collection method (Wagner, 1988: 19). Conditions for charcoal collection will depend substantially on the soil matrix. Dry sieving, while being the quickest and least costly method, is not suitable for wet soils or those containing much clay (like many UK depositional environments, for instance). Examination of the dry-sieved charcoals only is reported here. The approach aimed to optimize cost/benefit, while ensuring the adequacy of the subsampling strategy adopted.",

Keepax, 1988: 45 andAsouti, 2001: 96) who recommend a minimum of twenty-five to fifty contexts). Excavated contexts in a dense urban environment can vary in volume greatly, compared with the usual consistency of floated soils in pre-and proto-historic sites that are typically a fixed quantity of 20-50 l. However, this difference is not a drawback, provided a range of context types and volumes are examined. Flotation of a fixed volume of soil is less representative than sieving all excavated soils, although it does enable the collection of much smaller fragments. New research, however, suggests that bias (by way of over-representation, of oak in particular), is greatly observed in the 1-2 mm fraction, and even to a degree in the 2-4 mm fraction (Chrzavzez et al., 2011). Asouti and Austin (2005) (and others) recommend sampling, especially middens or other secondary refuse deposits, to obtain the most suitable data. In Pompeii, no true refuse dump was found at the House of the Vestals (or indeed in any of the other sites currently being examined within the city).",

Ranges of optimum fragment counts from a low of about 100 to a high of about 400 fragments are recommended per context (or period) (see, for example, Keepax, 1988: 120-24;Chabal et al., 1999: 66;Asouti, 2001: 96).

(wild and cultivated, cherry) in the earlier centuries, with P. dulcis, P. persica, and P. armenaica probably appearing more often in the late first century BC into the first century AD. The later appearance of a greater variety of cultivated Prunus spp. agrees with both the carpology and charcoal results from the Porta Nocera Tomb (Matterne & Derreumaux, 2008;Coubray, 2012), and broadly with the carpology results from the House of the Surgeon (Murphy, 2010;Murphy et al., 2012). The Maloideae subfamily includes fruits such as pear or apple, but also other taxa such as hawthorn and whitebeam or the service tree (sorb). Those identified only to the family level of Rosaceae are fragments with poor preservation characteristics, which could not be confidently resolved to a lower level. Small quantities of a range of woods that may also be considered food and/or medicinal plants (according to the ancient texts, in particular Pliny the Elder's Natural History) were observed. These include Vitis vinifera, and of the Pinus spp. (pine) possibly P. pinea (the stone pine that produces edible nuts), but some fragments are also one or more of the montane types, possibly P. nigra or P. mugo.

There is an increase in diversity through time, especially after the Sullan siege and subsequent colonization, which followed Pompeii's subjugation in 80 BC (during the Social Wars).

Equally, the extant Samnite population might have been responsible for this change, since acculturation meant adoption of cultural mores in both directions. The decrease in beech over time is interesting in that it may be interpreted in one of two ways. On the one hand, pressure on the beech supply caused a diminution of beech forest at more accessible levels, and perhaps the available beech at mid-montane levels was replaced by other deciduous types, such as the oaks, hornbeams, and maples (which increase in presence over time).

The climate of the Mediterranean region two thousand years ago is widely considered to have been similar in temperature to today, or perhaps even slightly warmer, although many conflicting data exist (Lamb, 1977(Lamb, , 1995;;Dragoni, 1998;Reale & Dirmeyer, 2000;Reale & Shukla, 2000).

While in this instance it is especially difficult to separate out anthropogenic changes from small climactic variations, it is very unlikely that beech grew in profusion on the plain since it prefers altitude and good drainage, and the Sarno plain was very boggy. Pollen evidence suggests the wood was plentiful in the classical period (Grove & Rackham, 2001), and, if this were the case, it can be inferred that growth conditions were good and beech-dominated forests may have been extensive at high altitudes.",

These were identified as beech, and further noted to be of large dimensions, and possibly 'collected nearby'. Castelletti interpreted this as being wood prepared as charcoal fuel. Subsequent interpretations of this report have extended his observations well past the reported results and led to the promulgation of the idea of a 'sacred beech grove' growing in the sixth-century city (e.g. Bonghi Jovino, 1984). This is an implausible interpretation given the ecological requirements of beech, whose optimal growth zone is above 900 m, compared to Pompeii's location at near sea level, and also because the cutting of larger branches or small trunks for making charcoal would seem at odds with a religious use.",

This is yet to be proven, however, and we cannot assume standard modern market forces existed in the ancient world. Beech prefers weakly acidic soils, so the calcareous Lattari Mountains (to the south) and the Apennines (to the east), could have supplied fuel to the city. These areas are respectively 15 and 25 km distant, the latter representing about a day's journey. Wood and/or wood charcoal fuel could have been transported by oxen and cart or mule train, down the mountain to the main road, or to the Sarno River. From there it could have been transported to the city, either along the riverside road, or perhaps on the river itself on a seasonal basis.",

The nature and volume of the fruit and nut woods suggest these were likely cuttings used as kindling, and they may have been locally available from gardens and orchards inside the city walls, or from more distant areas of the lower mountain areas where orchards grew. Being a wealthy household, the House of the Vestals may have owned land in the mountains, sending their own slaves to collect wood and/or make charcoal, and transport the fuel to the city. It is also possible that a more developed wood and charcoal market existed, as it did in Rome (Diosono, 2008a(Diosono, , 2008b)).",

      "text": "This study of urban fuel use in a wealthy household in Pompeii suggests a strong link between the city and its hinterland mountains, providing a more outward-looking view of one part of Pompeii's economy. It demonstrates that sampling of available charcoals, of 5 mm or more in length, from dry-sieved soils can be a cost-effective manner to view the wood fuel supply in a dense urban environment. It is acknowledged that dry sieving cannot be carried out at all sites. Excavators finding only a few fragments of charcoal per context often believe that they do not have much charcoal and thus do not collect it. However, even this small amount of data, synthesized over many contexts provides useful results. Charcoal may be collected like any other artefact, and not necessarily reserved for specialist collection by flotation. Combining data from individual contexts, into centuries for reporting purposes overcomes the difficulties of small data quantities from individual contexts. This is a valid strategy: firstly, because it is based on truly systematic and holistic data collection, and secondly because changes in the environment from which fuel is derived are unlikely to be able to be detected in much shorter periods. In the case of the House of the Vestals, a distinctive pattern of fuel consumption has been observed that correlates with the increasing complexity of social and economic activity that developed in Pompeii, especially after the Roman colonization in 80 BC. A vertical supply arrangement (by villa owners from their own forest supply areas) could have existed, and/or a more general market supply. In either case, wood and wood charcoal fuel were transported over considerable distances. Inferred labour and transport costs suggest the fuel economy was an important part of the overall economy of the city.",

Les Ã©tudes bioarchÃ©ologiques peuvent contribuer considÃ©rablement Ã la comprÃ©hension des interactions Ã©conomiques entre les villes et leur arriÃ¨re-pays. Ã€ PompÃ©i, oÃ¹ la recherche s'est surtout concentrÃ©e sur le site intra-muros, l'analyse des restes biologiques est souvent limitÃ©e aux denrÃ©es alimentaires consommÃ©es comme les os et les rÃ©sidus macrobotaniques. Dans la plupart des cas le charbon, s'il est ramassÃ©, n'est pas examinÃ©, bien que cette matiÃ¨re est la clÃ© pour comprendre comment une ville organise son approvisionnement en et sa consommation de combustible. Cette Ã©tude poursuit deux buts: d'abord, dÃ©crire une mÃ©thode efficace d'Ã©chantillonnage et d'analyse de charbon dans un environnement urbain dense en n'utilisant que du charbon de taille supÃ©rieure Ã 5 mm obtenu par tamisage par voie sÃ¨che, et ensuite, montrer de cette faÃ§on les relations de dÃ©pendance entre PompÃ©i et son arriÃ¨re-pays pour l'approvisionnement en combustible dans une Ã©tude de cas de la Maison des Vestales. Une Ã©tude-pilote de 25 contextes provenant de 6 'chambres' et de 750 morceaux de charbon fÃ»t suivi d'une Ã©tude approfondie de 62 contextes de 14 'chambres' (un total de 1579 morceaux de charbon). Les rÃ©sultats Ã©tendus n'identifiaient que 2 autres taxons (insignifiants) (reprÃ©sentÃ©s par seulement trois morceaux). Le plus important parmi le bois identifiÃ© Ã©tait le hÃªtre (Fagus sylvatica), qui reprÃ©sentait entre 50 Ã 75% de l'alimentation en combustible, selon la pÃ©riode considÃ©rÃ©e. Les hÃªtres poussent de prÃ©fÃ©rence au-dessus de 900 m dans le centre et le sud de l'Italie. PompÃ©i est situÃ© Ã 30 m d'altitude; les rÃ©gions montagneuses les plus proches se trouvent Ã une distance d'au moins 15 km. L'Ã©tude suggÃ¨re qu'une mÃ©thodologie qui se fonde sur la collection de charbon provenant de tamisage sec effectuÃ© couramment (tamis de 5 mm), dans des sols oÃ¹ ceci est possible, peut apporter des rÃ©sultats fiables Ã peu de frais, dans un milieu urbain.
