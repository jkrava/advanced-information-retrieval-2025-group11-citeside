        "text": "So interrupted the emperor Claudius when a heated debate erupted among the Senate regarding the virtues of butchers and barmen before, as Suetonius continued, the emperor \"rambled off into a speech about the abundance of city bars in his youth and how he often used to visit them himself'. Claudius' audience would have found his outburst absurd. The Ã©lite perspective on the role of food and drink outlets, or bars, in an urban society was clear: these were retailers in gluttony, and morally reprehensi ble haunts suited only to the lowest strata of society. But to what extent is this image of Roman food and drink outlets reflected in the archaeological remains, and how essential were they to an ancient society? Pompeii, buried by the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, pre serves the greatest collection of bars of the Roman period from which to ask these questions. Scattered about the city are 158 food and drink out lets, recognisable in the archaeological record by their distinctive display and sales counters. The vast majority of these counters were constructed of masonry, a number of which were faced with coloured fragments of re used marble; some wooden counters existed also. These service counters were patently constructed to facilitate the retail sale of food and drink: they were placed at the street front of the property for public display and access; were equipped with storage containers, some of which retained identifiable foodstuffs when excavated; and usually contained an in-built hearth for the heating and cooking of food and drink (fig. 1).",

      "text": "This paper will demonstrate the fundamental importance of food and drink outlets to the urban community of Pompeii. There is an imbalance of infor mation concerning the daily consumption of food and drink in the Roman world. The tendency for scholars to focus on the ancient literary record, itself concerned mainly with the dining habits of the patricians, has limit ed our understanding of this element of Roman quotidian life. When attempts have been made to understand the broader social spread of con sumption, scholars have tended to follow the perceptions of the past, choosing to imagine bars solely as places of impiety and limiting their dis cussions, and conclusions, as to where in the city such activities were accepted. A fuller appreciation of the intrinsic value of food and drink out lets is warranted. The available archaeological evidence can demonstrate not only their importance to the everyday operation of the city -social interaction, vocation, accommodation and, of course, the provision of food and drink -but as a consequence the value in examining these types of establishments.",

You will m eet virtue in the temple, the forum, the Senate house; standing in defence of the city walls, dusty and sunburnt, with calloused hands. Seneca, De vita benta 7.3 Send your Legate to Ostia, O Caesar, but search for him [Lateranus] in some big bar! There he will be, lying cheek-by-jowl beside a cut-throat, in the company of sailors, thieves, and runaway slaves, beside hangm en and coffinmakers, or by some eunuch priest passed out. H ere is Liberty Hall! One cup serves for everybody; no one has a bed to himself, nor a table apart from the rest. Juvenal, Satires 8. As a contrast to virtue, and all it encompassed -not merely a set of sought after values, but its embodiment in estimable institutions and their build ings -Seneca chose the brothel and the bar to symbolise pleasure -itself standing for vice, vulgarity and all that was wretched about the city. To complete the picture, Juvenal portrayed the quality of clientele one would most likely encounter among the dives. These were the scallywags and drunkards, the unsophisticated and unrefined, seeking neither respect nor dignity, but instead gluttony and loose companionship.",

      "text": "What is there to learn from the ancient sources about the retail sale of food and drink? Of the 174 references to bar-like activity found among the ancient texts, most overstated the moral turpitude of such establishments, and of those who hung about them.1 It was common to defame another's character by placing them among the bars and taverns, to all hours, with certain emperors not beyond reproach: Gaius Caligula (A.D. 37-41), Claudius , Vitellius (A.D. 69), Lucius Verus were all known to have loitered, at times in disguise, among the city bars.2 But apart from portraying the bars as dens of iniquity, as colourful and entertaining as the image may be, the sources offer but a lim ited scope for inquiry into the role of bars in an ancient and urban com munity. None consider the civic needs of the urban indigents, nor of how these were satisfied through the retail sale of staple foods, cooked meals and even boiled water. The lack of useful information offered by the texts is exacerbated by the fact that, since Tonnes Kleberg's seminal work of almost half a century ago, the study of Roman bars has been firmly rooted in the use of literary sources.3 This has limited the study to themes of ter minology and etymology, yet at the same time Pompeian scholarship remains without a clear understanding of how a food and drink business might be recognised in the archaeological record. The texts were also con cerned with the megalopolis of Rome, while Pompeii was a small South Italian city which, although under the administration of Rome after the Social Wars of the early first century B.C., developed under separate social and localised traditions. So how are we to identify, in a city such as Pompeii, these dens of iniquity, or develop any clearer understanding of their activities and social function?",

Instead, various Latin terms generally asso ciated with bar-like activities have been applied to an array of building types at various Roman cities.4 For Pompeii this translates into an urban network of buildings labelled tabernae, popinae, cauponae and thermopolia. Attached to these literary terms are a host of activities, in spite of the fact that these references never offer any suggestion of the specific functions or physical characteristics that might be recognisable in the archaeological record today. Moreover, these properties share few common characteristics: some have counters, others do not; some are equipped with hearths and ovens, others are without; and some are large complexes with many rooms, while others are small one-room joints. There is no pattern. Yet in spite of these problems, the traditional approach has been to accept such designa tions, along with their suggestion of specific activities, as though they were primary evidence. What is needed is a more clearly defined recognition that considers all of the available evidence, especially that which actively con tributed toward the operation of each establishment.",

Those that survive were simple masonrybuilt hearths with a tiled burning surface enclosed by a U-shaped small wall that supported a metal grill or tripod for the cooking vessel.11 That these in-built hearths were placed at the ends of the counters raises ques tions about the expulsion of smoke. Of all the hearths attached to counters, only one retained some sign of an attached chimney. A small terracotta tube was found protruding from the top of the in-built hearth of the count er at IX.11.2.12 However, it is possible that this terracotta tube was used as a means for smoking foods. In any case, this is an unusual example as none of the other hearths show any visible comparanda. Without the use of chimneys it would seem that these types of hearths, located generally two to three metres from the threshold, were reliant upon the spaciousness of the room and the relative proximity to the open facade for circulation.

Listed for sale on the wall of the bar at IX.7.24-25 were var ious commodities and their prices, but without quantities: cheese (1 -2 asses, though soft cheese was 4 asses); bread (8 asses, or 2 asses for 'slave' bread); oil (3 -7 asses); wine (2 -3 asses, but 'champion wine' was con siderably more expensive starting at 1 denarius); onions (5 asses); wheat (1 denarius); cucumbers (1 ass); dates (1 ass); and sausages (1 ass).21 One of the words listed, extremely odd as it is the only known instance in Latin, was H XERES\\ The term is believed to have originated from the Greek, meaning \"dried foods\".22 A well-known wall painting from Ostia, found in the bar on Via di Diana, I.2.5, illustrates further.23 It shows the various foods that would have been sold here: olives, turnips, hard-boiled eggs, and cheeses hanging from a nail in the wall. The painting was significant ly located above a set of display shelves on which some of these foods would have shared space with plates, bowls and cups. This setting is known from of a number of grave reliefs from the Roman world that illus trate bar counters with storage and display shelves stacked with plates and cups, foods and drinks (fig. 2).24",

In Pompeii this image is familiar among the countless grand homes and villas. Their value was measured in the expanse of private space they offered away from the din of city life, space being the great determinate of social class. But what of the poorer classes and those who were without dining couches and reception halls, areas for private social ising, kitchens or even the most basic cooking facilities? Their small and humble living spaces have not been preserved to any great degree; these were sheared off with all the upper floors of Pompeii during the final pyro clastic surge.25 Had they survived it is likely they would have displayed similar living arrangements, albeit less dense, to the lower class living blocks in Rome. The apartments in Rome were found without even the most basic cooking arrangements.26 That the many urban indigents of the various Roman cities relied on food and drink outlets for their daily sup ply of staple foods, cooked and prepared, along with seemingly simple services like boiling water -whether for diluting wine or for any other number of cooking needs -is patently recognisable in the archaeological record of Pompeii.27 What is more, the very amount of these establish ments about the city ought to have drawn a more balanced consideration of their role. The 158 Pompeian bars represent the highest proportion, about 27%, of the various shops in Pompeii, 577 in total.28",

Much has been said about the spatial arrangement of the ancient city, particularly the organization, or not as the case may be, of building types and activi ties, especially since Raper's pioneering paper published in 1977.29 In regards to Pompeian bars, it has been duly recognised that many were located along the main thoroughfares, and that the general picture was one of a jumbled arrangement.30 Indeed the primary routes were littered with food and drink outlets, the busiest sections being the access routes into and out of the city: no less than 94 (59% of the total) bars can be counted along these roads.31 It is not without significance that food and drink out lets occupied the commercially viable and high-rent street-fronts, a situa tion suggestive of the level of investment placed in them by their owners and tenants.32 That high-profit land was given over to the retail sale of food and drink is further attested by their regular incidence at intersections, the busiest confluence of people and traffic for any urban network. Of the 96 known intersections that connected the vast Pompeian street system, not less than 60 (about two thirds) were bordered by a bar.33 For almost every bar locat ed at one of these bustling intersections, the counter was placed on the optimum side of the facade to allow an unobstructed viewshed for those on the street (fig. 4).34 These were obvious and eye-catching facades designed to attract the attention of passers-by, and their regular occur rence about the city would have been a familiar sight to any Pompeian.",

Pompei, gennaio 1999-maggio 2000, Roma, 2001, pp. 1-27. 33 The 60 intersections had 79 of the 158 (50%) Pompeian bars. This represents a remark ably higher proportion than seen by Hermansen at Ostia where just 8 of the 38 bars were located at an intersection -see Gustav HERMANSEN,Ostia. Aspects o f Roman City L if e .,op. cit.,p. 185. He found this to be a high proportion for any single profession. It ought to be noted that the figures from Pompeii exclude, quite obviously, the approximate one-third of the city that is yet to be exhumed. 34 The few exceptions to this pattern seem to be those for which the free-placement of the counter was prohibited by the internal or structural arrangement of the front room. commentaries? On the distribution of bars there exists but a few snippets of information in the texts, all subtle in detail. The most revealing are the few that tell of the weary traveller arriving in town to find a bar nearby the city gate, a situation clearly consistent with the archaeology.35 Only a sin gle reference tells of a bar being hidden away from the main thoroughfares: Martial's Epigrammata has a drunken gambler being yanked out of a 'secluded' bar (popina).36 Yet in spite of the relative silence of the ancient sources on the distribution of bars, their united stance on the amoral role of the urban bar pervades this area of inquiry. In an attempt to identify the 'deviant zones' at Pompeii, Ray Laurence cited a number of ancient authors to demonstrate that the presence of bars could determine a zone of the city as unacceptable to the socially Ã©lite.37 This approach might at first seem reasonable given the weight of polemic aimed squarely at the urban bar. These were havens of abnormal behaviour, such as \"prostitu tion, 'excessive' alcoholic consumption and gambling\"; in general, any thing that \"contravene[d] the rules of [Pompeian] society.\"38 Persuaded by this premise, and erroneously following the custom of identifying property types by the labels attributed to them in the 19th century, Laurence found that Pompeian bars were located away from the largest houses so that the Ã©lites could \"shelter their wives and children from contact with deviants.\"39 In support of this theory, John De Felice insisted \"this was not the result of voluntary placement by business owners nor was it simply a result of businesses simply locating in the busier areas of town. It was a result of civic authority engaging in a type of moral zoning to exclude cer tain types of people and business from the parts of town more likely to [sic] the domain of Roman matrons and children.\"40",

But to reduce the study to a single means of inquiry, itself concerned with but a single aspect, denies the broader social function of food and drink outlets and the true value of their study. The archaeological evidence clearly demonstrates that these were essential features of the urban land scape. The retail sale of staple foods and drink, the provision of a cooked meal and/or cooking facilities, as well as a gathering place to facilitate social conviviality were essential needs of the ancient community.
