      "text": "Explosive volcanic eruptions typically show a huge column of ash and debris ejected into the stratosphere, crackling with lightning. Yet equally hazardous are the fast moving avalanches of hot gas and rock that can rush down the volcano's flanks at speeds approaching 280 kilometers per hour. Called pyroclastic flows, these surges can reach temperatures of 400ÂºC. Fast currents and hot temperatures can quickly overwhelm communities living in the shadow of volcanoes, such as what happened to Pompeii and Herculaneum after the 79 C.E. eruption of Italy's Mount Vesuvius or to Saint-Pierre after Martinique's Mount PelÃ©e erupted in 1902.",

      "text": "Increasingly, monitoring active explosive volcanoes involves studying infrasound. Infrasound is the low-frequency component of sound, ranging from 0.001 to about 20 hertz, below the human threshold of hearing. Many natural phenomena such as earthquakes, avalanches, landslides, tornadoes, and tsunamis are efficient sources of infrasound. Volcanoes are especially prolific infrasonic radiators: On active explosive volcanoes, volumetric sources rapidly expanding in the atmosphere produce infrasound, providing valuable insights into eruption dynamics. In particular, volcanoes characterized by lava dome growth exhibit infrasound generated by nonexplosive sources related to dome collapses, such as pyroclastic flows [Yamasato, 1997], rockfalls [Moran et al., 2008], and lahars. Such acoustic monitoring is fast becoming a standard technique on active volcanoes worldwide because of its potential to rapidly assess eruptive activity.",

      "desc": "Fig. 2. (a) Map showing the position of the array on Saint George's Hill and tracking of the pyroclastic flow on 29 July 2008 by real-time array location. The plot shows that the direction to the infrasonic source changed with time, shifting an angle of 14Âº from A (117Âº from north) to B (131Âº from north) with respect to the array as a result of the movement of the flow toward the south-southeast. Contour lines (0.9, 0.8, and 0.7) represent the distribution of the semblance indicating the direction from where sound is propagating ( back-azimuth). (b) Infrasonic signal, measured in pascals (Pa), associated with the flow propagation as recorded at sensor 2 of the array. (c) Distribution of multichannel semblance as a function of shifting direction ( back-azimuth) and time. The blue dashed line indicates the threshold used to localize the source. (d) Repeated variations of the changing angle (azimuth) of the infrasonic signals during the main flow phase, showing clear pulses in flow along the volcano's flanks. Locations A and B are marked for reference.",
