The manuals recognise quite correctly that the present form of the Porta Marina due, first to the rebuilding of the gate proper in the second century B. C., and then t addition of the inner rooms and the long arched passage probably in the early yea Sulla's colony; the remains of private structures immediately outside the gate nat date from the last period before the eruption. This leads to a consideration of the theory developed by A. Sogliano 3, that t originally no entrance at the Porta d'Ercolano, and none in fact at that point derstand his meaning -earlier than the present structure. The latter supposition is not tenable in view of the evidence afforded partly by the alignment of certa outside the gate, and still more by the manner in which the well-built stone str the wall is interrupted: the original gate lay a few feet further to the west than t 1 Rendiconti dei Lincei, Classe Scienze Mor., Stor. e Fil., Ser.

Besides, the presence of an extensive Samnite necropolis and left of the highway as one goes from the Porta d'Ercolano a strong presumption in the same sense. While we do not possess the elements for appraising the d this point, still the above-mentioned evidence for the presence times tends seriously to weaken the force of Sogliano's theory2 of the city: namely, that the cardo was the Strada Stabiana, an Nolana (for which he assumes a gate at the west end as we east) and the Strada dell'Abbondanza. When writing his article anist did not have access to my proposal 3 to recognise in the degli Augustali, and the southern part of the Strada Stabiana, t dating the Etruscan town-plan; I once more recommend this su of scholars, in the belief that it offers the solution of severa light on early conditions at this site. My suggestion that th Etruscan cardo had of course been advanced before, as the ide appears to have rejected it because the north end of this stre not a gate, in the city wall; and he might have added that th end either; but it should be remembered that both the tower t the south date from a period far later than that with which builders of the tower would have chosen the position as command</p><p>If there was originally a gate at each end of this cardo, topog have made it ceremonial or decorative rather than utilitarian would have been for it to fall into neglect and eventually to b in imagining this is certainly no greater than that involved i the western end of the Strada di Nola .</p><p>V. -THE APSE ARCH OF THE K OFFICES OF THE DUOVIRI ,.</p><p>The easternmost of the three public buildings at the south end of the Forum is no conspicuous for the high arch, in large part preserved 6, which separates its apse from Pompeii. Repeated and careful ocular observation from the ground, at intervals of six months or a year, has convinced me that it showed a normal form of semicircular arch, consisting of two concentric half-circles of tiles, the outer set of which however was not solid but merely faced the two surfaces of the wall. The inner series of tiles has been uniformly removed or destroyed, probably by the survivors of the catastrophe, who discovered that there lay here ready to their hand a quantity of large pieces of tile suitable for use in their own building operations. The photograph (P1. 59, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) shows that this operation has exposed the concrete body of the concavity of the arch, as distinguished from its facing of tiles; if we allow one foot or more for the tiles that were once in position, the result will be the original circle which took up the lines of the wall-ends on which the arch rests. The circle of tiles which is seen at present consists of the original second circle, which reinforced the circle now lost, but on the surfaces only of the walls; below the springing of the arch, the facing-tiles of the walls were hacked away to an amount of fifteen courses on the east wall and fourteen courses on the west wall.</p><p>The result has been to give the impression to the spectator that the curve of the arch was continued for more than 1800, that is to say, that we have here a ((horse-shoe arch )); and in fact this has been called the earliest known example of the type to be found in Italy'.</p><p>That this was not however the intention of the makers appears to be established by the observations summarised above. The peculiar plan of this structure is shown in the handbooks 2; there is a symm arrangement of the large curved niche and the two small rectangular ones on each the great door.

The small niches measure m. 1.15 in width, and their depth to the back wall is about m. 0.50. The peculiarity of their plan -a shallow base behind, and a tripartite arrangement in front-is probably due to the necessity of affixing the bronze inscriptions in the position now occupied by the cast of the elogium of Romulus, as shown in the picture, while at the same time a statue was to be placed upon the base.There are clear traces that the back walls of the niches were veneered with slabs of marble; hence we cannot think of reliefs in this position.

In fact, the inclusion of these two latter personages in the first place, no fragments of inscriptions in their hono cinity, and beside, the archetypes of the class of elogia to whi and Romulus belong, namely those erected by Augustus in Ro temple of Mars Ultor 4, did not include Caesar and August is there reason for supposing that these rulers were later inser of which was to commemorate the worthies of olden days and resentatives of the Julian house. Another arrangement seems appropriate and not improbable to right): (1) Roma, who required no inscription for identific the relative inscription commemorates as the founder of Rom scription states, led the Trojan survivors to Italy; and (4) Italia the identification of which no inscription was needed.

It is to be hoped that the government excavations now in progress about the temple of Mars Ultor will result in additions to our repertory of elogia. If the report is true that an elogium of Julius Caesar's father has already been discovered, this would bring the official series down to what in the Augustan age was a comparatively recent past but still beyond the memory of all but the very oldest among the living.

The amount of attention which various features in Pompeii have excited, both amo tourists and in the world of scholarship, is not always proportionate to their intrinsic s nificance. For some reason, a matter which the successive groups of scholars who have v ited the site under my guidance have felt to be one of the most impressive memorials the place's history has remained practically unnoticed3: namely, the numerous marks t be seen on the exterior of the town wall and apparently due to the operations of the tro of the Sullan party who, as appears from OROSIUS V, xviii, 22, laid siege to Pompei the year 89 B. C. The marks in question fall into three classes, large, intermediate and small, the ameter of the large ones being in general about m. 0.14; of the intermediate ones, m. 0 to 0.08; and of the small ones, m. 0.01 to 0.02. Some at least of these are due, in m opinion, to the impact respectively of balls from ballistae and shot from slings: the imp from these missiles would have pulverised a certain area of the surface of the stone the wall, which area may well have varied somewhat with the force of impact 4. These marks are found in large numbers along a stretch of the walls extending som 100 feet to the west of the Porta di Vesuvio (Plate 60, fig. 1), terminating at a port which was rebuilt in rubble in antiquity; and also for some 25 feet to the east of the Por 1 Livy, 1, xiii, 8, Inde non modo commune sed concors etiam regnum duobus regibus fuit; DIONYS.

I My good friend Dr. M. Della Corte of the Administration of the Excavations at Pompeii has been so kind as to contribute the following observations: the holes are curving, show no signs of chiselling or tool work, and are found on different parts of the face of the stones so that they are not to be interpreted as cramps or dowel holes. In his opinion they were caused by some instrument of percussion, probably an aries with a metallic head.
