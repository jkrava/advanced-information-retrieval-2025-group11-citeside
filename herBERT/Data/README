## A -> B 

### Sample 1: check citation from Paper 1 in Paper 2
2020.acl-main.398 -> P19-1459

**citation**: "We follow Niven and Kao (2019) and report the median for 5 independent runs, as BERT-based models can degenerate."

**argument**: "Since Bert based models can degenerate it is a practice to report the median of indepent runs. Niven and Kao (2019)" 

### Sample 2: check citation from Paper 1 in Paper 3
2020.acl-main.398 -> N19-1423

**citation**: Concretely, we set the supervision to be of cell selection if p a (op 0 ) ≥ S, where 0 < S < 1 is a threshold hyperparameter, and the scalar answer supervision otherwise. This follows hard EM (Min et al., 2019), as for spurious programs we pick the most probable one according to the current model.

**argument**: Hard EM commits to a models most probable program by switching supervision if the probability of a specific operation exceeds a certain threshold. (Min et al., 2019)

### Sample 3: check citation from Paper 4 in Paper 5
2020.emnlp-main.213 -> N19-1423

**citation**: In recent years, word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019) have emerged as a commonly used alternative to n-gram matching for capturing word semantics similarity.

**argument**: Word embeddings are commonly used for capturing word semantivs similarity. (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019)
