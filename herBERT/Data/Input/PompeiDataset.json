In addition to excavations in Britain and survey work in Turkey, he has directed a project in the Insula of the Menander at Pompeii, in course of publication as a five-volume monograph. He is also the author of general books on Pompeii, on ancient mosaics, and on Roman painting. Eric M. Moormann holds the Chair of Classical Archaeology at Radboud University, Nijmegen (The Netherlands) and also reads at Amsterdam University. His Ph.D., published in 1988, discussed the representation of sculpture in wall paintings. He has published extensively on mural painting from the Vesuvian area, Rome and Ostia. A catalogue of the classical sculptures in the Allard Pierson Museum at Amsterdam came out in 2000. A monograph on Nero's Golden House at Rome, written in collaboration with P. G. P. Meyboom, is due shortly. He currently co-directs a restoration and research project in the hierothesion of Kommagene at Nemrud Dagi (Eastern Turkey). Another topic of interest is the reception history of antiquity in Western culture, especially that of Pompeii. Salvatore Ciro Nappo is a classical archaeologist and a graduate of the Università Federico II di Napoli under Prof. A. De Franciscis in 1981. He subsequently attended the Scuola di Specializzazione in Archeologia Classica, and in 1986 completed an advanced degree in the integrated conservation of cultural patrimony. His scientific interests lie primarily in the areas of Roman architecture and painting. He has directed excavations at Napoli (Palazzo Corigliano), Irpinia (Aequum Tuticum), Stabiae (Villa Ariadne) and Pompei (insulae I.14, I.16, I.21, I.22, Murecine). He has also been responsible for the restoration of houses and wall decoration in Regions I and II at Pompeii. Among his publications are: Pompei-Guida alla città sepolta (1998), . . . Mitis Sarni Opes: gli scavi di Murecine (2000) and \"La decorazione parietale dell' Hospitium dei Sulpici in località Murecine a Pompei\" (MEFRA 113, 2001). Christopher Parslow is Professor of Classical Studies and Archaeology at Wesleyan University. He is interested in all aspects of the sites buried by the eruption of Vesuvius. His first book, Rediscovering Antiquity: Karl Weber and the Excavations of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabiae (Cambridge 1995) explored the life of Karl Weber, the Swiss military engineer who supervised the Bourbon-era excavations at those sites, and his contributions to the history of archaeology. He is currently completing a monographic study of the Praedia Iuliae Felicis (Regio II.4.1-12) in Pompeii. Kees Peterse is the Head of PANSA BV, a scientifically based company dedicated to the reconstruction of Roman architecture. His graduation from the Polytechnic at 's-Hertogenbosch was followed by Ph.D. research in Classical Archaeology at the Radboud University of Nijmegen, focussing on early masonry techniques and early domestic architecture in Pompeii. Anticipating his current position, he was director of Peterse Architectuur BV, founded by his father. During 1997-98 he was a visiting lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin. He currently works on the virtual reconstruction of Roman Nijmegen, both the buildings and their settings. The fruits of his efforts are on display in various museums. -C o n t r i b u t o r sxxiii Felix Pirson is currently Head of the Istanbul Department of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, after a term as a \"Wissenschaftlicher Assistent\" at the Institute of Classical Archaeology at Leipzig University. After degrees from Munich University and the Faculty of Classics at Cambridge (UK), he obtained his Ph.D. for a dissertation on rented apartments at Pompeii and Herculaneum. He has worked with Jens-Arne Dickmann on the publication of a jointly directed research project at Pompeii, which was conducted by the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut (DAI) and an international team of archaeologists, scientists and conservators between 1997-2002. His other fields of research include images of war in antiquity and the archaeology of Pergamum. Damian Robinson is the Director of the Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology and a William Golding Fellow at Brasenose College Oxford. Prior to this he was a Lecturer in Classical Archaeology at the University of Oxford and a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow in Roman Archaeology at the University of Bradford, where he carried out research into the social and economic development of Pompeii. His Ph.D. was also from the University of Bradford and involved a spatial analysis of the urban fabric of Pompeii. With Rick Jones, he directs the Anglo American Project in Pompeii. Haraldur Sigurdsson is a volcanologist of Icelandic origin, and Professor of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. He has conducted research on most of the major volcanic eruptions in historic time, with a particular emphasis on the impact of large explosive eruptions on human cultures, such as the eruptions of Tambora in 1815 and Krakatau in 1883. His current research focuses on the great Bronze Age eruption of Santorini in the Aegean Sea, and its impact on the Minoan culture. He began studies on the Vesuvius eruption of ad 79 in 1976. Alastair M. Small is an Honorary Fellow in Classics at the University of Edinburgh and Professor Emeritus of the University of Alberta. He has been working for more than forty years on the archaeology and history of South Italy in the Iron Age and Roman periods, on which he has numerous publications. He is currently directing a project of excavation, geophysics and field survey in a Roman imperial estate at Vagnari in Puglia. He has taught the archaeology of Pompeii for many years, and published a study of the imperial cult in the Macellum. Volker Michael Strocka is Ordinary Professor of Classical Archaeology at the Archäologisches Institut of the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität of Freiburg, Germany. He studied at Munich, Basel, Freiburg and Paris, and received his doctorate at Freiburg in 1965. From 1975 to 1981 he was First Director of the headquarters of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut at Berlin. He has directed long-term documentation and excavation projects at Ephesos (wall paintings and the re-erection of the Library of Celsus) and Pompeii (the \"Häuser in Pompeji\" series), and shorter ones in Thugga (Tunisia) and Nysa (Turkey). His interests and publications are manifold: ancient sculpture, Roman architecture and wall paintings, ancient libraries, and Greek and Roman art history. Rolf A. Tybout is the author of a monograph on first-century BC Roman architectural wall painting (\"Second Style\") based on his 1989 Leiden dissertation. His subsequent publications include studies on Vitruvius, the social significance of Roman wall -C o n t r i b u t o r sxxiv painting and Greek funerary inscriptions. He is also active in the field of musicology, publishing articles on the German composer Hans Pfitzner. He is currently working in the field of Greek epigraphy and is one of the editors of the Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum. Andrew Wallace-Hadrill is the Director of the British School at Rome and Professor of Classics at the University of Reading. Among his numerous publications on the Roman world, his 1994 book Houses and Society in Pompeii and Herculaneum won the James R. Wiseman award. He co-directs with Prof. Michael Fulford a project on Pompeii Regio I Insula 9. He is also director of the Herculaneum Conservation Project. Katherine E. Welch is Associate Professor of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, with her Ph.D. from the same institution. A specialist in Roman architecture, sculpture and painting, she is the winner of a Rome Prize and has been a Fellow of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Her publications range from studies of the Roman amphitheater to those of the art and architecture of Italy (particularly Rome), Greece and Asia Minor. Carroll William Westfall came to Notre Dame in 1998 as Frank Montana Professor and Chairman of the School of Architecture, serving as chairman until 2002. Earlier he taught at Amherst College, the University of Illinois in Chicago, and, after 1982, at the University of Virginia. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University. His initial work led to numerous articles and a book, In This Most Perfect Paradise (1974), a study of Early Renaissance Rome. His more recent studies of the relationship between the history, theory and practice of architecture are found in his contribution to the 1991 book Architectural Principles in the Age of Historicism written with Robert Jan van Pelt. His current focus is on tradition and classicism in architecture and the American city and the architect's capacity to nourish the Christian faith. -C o n t r i b u t o r sxxv P R E FA C E ᇹᇺᇹ John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss F or whom is this book intended? Our audience is the same as that of Mau and Kelsey, or at least the same as the Mau-Kelsey audience that we have observed during the last thirty years: scholars (especially Pompeii scholars); college and university teachers; students of archaeology; students in general enrolled in the ubiquitous courses on Pompeii taught at colleges and universities around the world; and the general public interested in learning more about Pompeii. This does not mean, however, that we present this book as \"the new Mau:\" far from it. August Mau's Pompeji in Leben und Kunst (Pompeii: its life and art, as translated by Francis W. Kelsey) was a unique creation of a single pioneer scholar, and a product of the late nineteenth century, just as our The World of Pompeii is a unique assemblage of essays by numerous scholars working at Pompeii in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. In many ways, this volume is as much an introduction to Pompeian studies as a study of Pompeii. It was very difficult to produce this book, and far more time-consuming than we had imagined during the planning stages. Many delays were due to the nature of the publication, but many were due to the editors. We regret the former, and apologize for the latter. In the end, we hope that authors and readers alike will appreciate the good qualities of this very special book, and not dwell on the delays. This project began in the late 1990s because a suitably comprehensive, topically oriented, historically organized, and up-to-date treatment of Pompeii, Herculaneum and the other sites buried by Vesuvius did not exist in English. At the time, a number of useful studies had just been published. 1 However, the second edition of (Anon, n.d.), was still being used in classrooms, which spoke to the quality of its panoptic vision. August Mau was born in Kiel in 1840; he died in Rome in 1909. Working out of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut in Rome, Mau was introduced to Pompeii at a time when research at the site was becoming internationalized. His first publication, concerned with wall painting, appeared in 1873, and his record began to flourish in 1874, breaking through with his work on Overbeck's fourth edition of Pompeji (1884). 2 That encyclopedic treatment inspired his own effort fifteen years later. It was commissioned, as his own preface states, first in English. The English translation was accomplished by Francis W. Kelsey, who was born in Ogden, New York, in 1858 xxvii and died in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1927. Kelsey had been Professor of Latin Language and Literature at the University of Michigan for ten years before Pompeii: its life and art came out. He went on to enjoy one of the most distinguished careers in classical archaeology. Kelsey was working on his own grand treatment of Pompeii at the time of his death; it may be apt in some small way that both editors began their careers as graduate students in the building that bears his name, the Kelsey Museum of Art and Archaeology at Michigan. 3 Mau's ability to synthesize the information available to him in a detailed and compelling manner has proved hard to match. In addition, given the advances made in the century since Mau's publication, it seems well-nigh impossible for one or even two individuals to comparably distill over 250 years of work in multiple languages, at the oldest continually excavated set of sites in the world, using about the same number of pages that Mau and Kelsey had. Our approach had to be different. We decided to invite scholars from around the world (Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States) to contribute chapters which, when compiled, might form the book we wished to have on our shelves as the \"first to consult.\" Multiple voices speak about these sites (sometimes in concert, at other times in contradiction), and we have attempted as best we can to knit them together coherently yet distinctively. Any disagreement that can be detected across chapters is not altogether undesirable; these sites are too large, too old and too complex for a simple and convenient picture to be drawn from them of life in ancient Italy. The reader is encouraged to consider the strengths and weaknesses of all the arguments in relation to each other. Meanwhile, we have tried to ensure that references are sufficiently detailed to allow readers to pick their way through that long tradition of scholarship and reach the sources of the evidence if they so choose. The labyrinthine problems of Pompeian scholarship are, in fact, addressed in the final chapter. The book is divided into four sections. John Dobbins edited \"Beginnings\" (Chapters 1-8) and \"The Community\" (Chapters 9-16), as well as Chapter 39. The sections on \"Housing\" (Chapters 17-28) and \"Society and Economy\" (Chapters 29-38) were overseen by Pedar Foss. While these chapters may be read in order, and are arranged thematically for easy consultation, there are plenty of issues and key pieces of evidence that appear in several different chapters across the sections we have created. In order to facilitate reading the relationships between chapters, we have inserted many crossreferences, which appear in this fashion: (cf. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Each chapter has its own set of bibliographical references in the endnotes, so that the sources most important to individual topics remain self-contained. As editors, we encouraged, but did not require, authors to provide bibliographies; many did provide them. As a result, each chapter is a self-contained unit, and we felt that a final comprehensive bibliography was unnecessary. Citations use the \"short title\" format, meaning that once a source has been cited in full within a chapter, its next mention is made in the form of an author and/or abbreviated title. In almost all cases we have followed the system of abbreviations for periodicals, series and books set by the American Journal of Archaeology. 4 We have abbreviated references to the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli collection as \"MNN,\" and abbreviations for ancient authors come from the Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd edn. \"Public\" inscriptions are capitalized; \"private\" graffiti/dipinti are italicized, although such distinctions can be difficult and seem arbitrary. -P r e f a c exxviii Major sites, buildings (in English), streets (in Italian) and city gates (in Italian) are labeled in Figures 12.1 and 28.1, and on the four maps following the Preface and on the CD. Because the sites are not oriented to cardinal points, directions can be confusing. For Pompeii, \"Map North\" is at the top. For Herculaneum (Map 4), it is at the left, although publications often use the top for \"Map North.\" This explains why the so-called cardines seem to run east-west, and the insulae orientales are at the south. Caveat lector. See Laidlaw, Ch. 39, Appendix 2, for map orientations in the early published sources. For all buildings cited in the chapters, a street address is given which correlates to the large city plans of Pompeii and Herculaneum (Maps 3 and 4). In the former case, addresses are tripartite, consisting of the Region (I-IX), insula (city-block), and entrance number(s) (commas indicate multiple entrances) for the building on the street (except when a structure takes up an entire insula, in which case the address is bipartite). Several names for the same structures have often appeared in the literature; for a concordance to Pompeii, one can refer to H. B. Van der Poel (ed.), Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, Pars II, Toponymy, Rome, 1983. The numbering scheme for spaces within buildings at Pompeii follows Carratelli and Baldassarre, Pitture e mosaici, unless otherwise noted. In the case of Herculaneum, there are no \"Regions,\" and so addresses have only an insula and address number. The editors wish to acknowledge first and foremost the excellent work of the authors and their patience over the long course of this volume's gestation. While it is a desideratum in such a book to summarize satisfactorily the state of knowledge in a particular area, there is much in these chapters that is new, and we thank the authors for working to find a balance between outline and originality. We are also grateful to the translators of the non-English contributions; they made possible our ability to edit those chapters confidently while preserving the style and approach of each author. 5 We are indebted to Pietro Giovanni Guzzo and the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Pompei for providing plans of Pompeii and Herculaneum and for permission to publish Soprintendenza photographs and photographs taken by the authors. Appreciation is also well deserved by Richard Stoneman and Routledge, for their willingness to see the project through. And finally, we gratefully acknowledge the dedication of Sue Leaper and Florence Production in producing this book. John Dobbins wishes to acknowledge the support given to the Pompeii Forum Project which, in turn, led to his collaboration with Pedar Foss on the present book: the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia; the National Endowment for the Humanities; the Ceres Foundation; and Gilbert and Judy Shelton. Scott Craver and Eric Field provided invaluable help with the maps. I am grateful to my wife, Kathy Dobbins, for her encouragement. Pedar Foss wishes to mention his appreciation for a Semple Fellowship Grant from the University of Cincinnati in 1997, which helped get the project started, as well as a John and Janice Fisher Time-Out from DePauw University in 2004, which helped to push the project to completion. 6 Finishing would not have been possible without the patient support of my wife, Rebecca Schindler, and the sublime distractions of my sons Simon and Jakob. Finally, we would like to include in the dedication, John H. D'Arms, who we had hoped could contribute a chapter on \"The public life of Pompeii,\" and whose untimely passing during the creation of this volume left us all to mourn a great scholar, mentor -P r e f a c exxix and friend. Benemerenti. From the beginning we had intended to dedicate this book to the memories of August Mau and Francis W. Kelsey. The inclusion of John D'Arms renders the dedication especially personal and poignant. 7 We remember, too, Jos A. K. E. DeWaele, Professor of Classical Archaeology at the University of Nijmegen, who was killed in a minibus accident while en route to Pompeii in 2001. 8 References to his work on the Doric temple in the Triangular Forum appear in several chapters.

I thank them all. 7 Pedar and I (along with authors Clayton Fant and Ann Koloski-Ostrow, and translator Maureen B. Fant) were graduate students of John D'Arms at the University of Michigan. In his final years John was President of the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) and his limited and precious research time was spent at the American Academy in Rome. On our last encounter I was examining the ambiguities and potential implications of Cicero's brief comment on Pompeii in Pro Sulla 60-62. Knowing that John was working at a nearby desk, and realizing that for their whole lives professors are connected to their former students, I invaded his research time with questions about Pro Sulla. At the time I appreciated our brief exchanges on a Pompeii topic in the stacks of the American Academy, and now I cherish them all the more. Thank you for much, John D'Arms (John Dobbins, ed.). 8 Jos DeWaele visited the University of Virginia once to deliver a lecture and he and I overlapped once in our research in Pompeii. His personal charisma and professional generosity revealed themselves on both occasions. I regret that my encounters with him were so few (John Dobbins, ed.). I n 310 BC, during the second Samnite war, the Romans and their naval allies carried out a raid against Nuceria. Livy (9.38.2-3) describes the territorial context as dominated by the fortified city of Pompeii, in which the families that cultivated the surrounding countryside took refuge. But Strabo (5.4.8) tells us that both Pompeii and Herculaneum had a more ancient history: thanks also to archaeological finds, modern historical criticism considers Pompeii to have already been fortified by the end of the sixth century BC. Parallel evidence is lacking for Herculaneum; it will be better to suspend judgment, but to keep in mind that Strabo records a closely parallel development for the two cities. For Pompeii's archaic period, except for the walls and the votive offerings at the Temple of Apollo, the evidence is scarce and uncertain; and in the surrounding countryside only unrecorded finds at Boscoreale can be mentioned. Near Castellammare di Stabia, at Santa Maria delle Grazie, however, a necropolis with trench tombs is known. Its grave goods consist of local and Etruscan products (some inscribed) in use from the end of the seventh until the fifth century BC. To complete our picture of the archaic Stabian settlement we have a small rural nucleus at Gesini di Casola, consisting of burials from the middle of the sixth to the first half of the fifth century BC, and the toponym Petra Herculis (Pliny the Elder, HN 32.17) for the islet of Rovigliano, located probably at the landing place. It is possible that Pompeii had gradually downgraded the archaic Stabian settlement's role as a port. Pompeii's predominance was facilitated by the control it could exercise on the mouth of the Sarno, located just south of the fortified hill of the city. On the right bank of the mouth of the Sarno is attested, at least from the fifth century BC, the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Bottaro (Figure 28.1, A). The approximate chronological coincidence between the end of the Stabian necropolis and the establishment of the cult at Bottaro seems significant. The trade on the Nola plateau used the river Sarno. The Samnites were establishing themselves in this area during the fifth century BC, replacing the Aurunci, who occupied it earlier. The Italic toponyms of both Nuceria and Nola contain the root Nou-, which indicates a \"new\" settlement. By the end of the fourth century BC, the city of Pompeii had elaborated a new urban layout that gradually filled up with buildings over its entire fortified area (c. 66 ha, or 165 acres). If we look at the main urban road axes (Maps 1-2), we can extend our examination to the surrounding countryside as well. The principal axis is the north-south road that links Porta Vesuvio and Porta di Stabia; east of it two streets head toward the towns of Nola and Sarno. The southern necropolis outside Porta Nocera follows the orientation of the road to Nuceria, which, on the way, crossed the ancient course of the river Sarno at Scafati. From Porta Ercolano, another very important road, to judge from the antiquity of its route, entered the city. It is, in fact, the only road that interrupted the regularity of the urban design by insulae, dividing insula 3 of Regio VI in two. From this layout we can infer that Pompeii was linked, from Porta Ercolano, to a coast road that passed the area later known as Oplontis (present-day Torre Annunziata), on its way to the coast, where it turned toward Neapolis and Cumae, via Herculaneum. From the archaic period, inside the fortified city, this coast road intersected with the north-south road that linked the southern slopes of Vesuvius with Stabiae. Furthermore, it was possible to travel up the valley of the Sarno from Pompeii along a number of river and land corridors. These routes intersected at the port at the mouth of the Sarno: it is therefore possible to infer that Pompeii developed profitably. It is, in fact, Pompeii's role as distribution point of the agricultural products of the district, whence they were sent on to external markets, that suggests that the countryside was farmed intensively-just as Livy describes it. But the archaeological evidence is practically nonexistent. To this phase can be ascribed a few tombs at Pozzano di Castellammare and a sanctuary in the same township, at Privati, with architectural terracottas made from moulds used in the decoration of the \"Doric temple\" of the Triangular Forum in Pompeii (Figure 6.2). It has been observed that the northern suburban villas of Pompeii show the same orientation as the roads that articulate Regio VI, one of the earliest of post-archaic Pompeii (Figure 28.2). 1 It has therefore been proposed that the countryside north of the city had been \"centuriated\" in continuation of the axes of the city streets, since there was originally a gate, later closed, also at the northern extremity of the Via di Mercurio (Figure 11.3). The farms and the suburban villas would have been built on this grid; some of these constituted the nucleus of the villas, oriented differently, whose Second-Style decoration tells us they were enlarged after the establishment of the Sullan colony (80 BC). Between the third and second centuries BC, the Samnite magistrates administrated the roads that ran south from Pompeii. There is epigraphic evidence for a \"Stabian bridge,\" which facilitated transit perhaps not only into town but also between the suburban sanctuaries of fondo Iozzino and S. Abbondio (dedicated to Bacchus), on opposite banks of the river Sarno (Figure 28.1, B-C). The location of the saltpans, documented by Oscan and Latin inscriptions, is uncertain. The replacement of the previous owners by the Roman colonists brought a period of internal turbulence, but the volcanic deposits from the eruption of AD 79 make it impossible to identify fully the successive centuriations of the ager. The toponym pagus (Augustus) Felix suburbanus (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), of uncertain location, suggests that the corresponding nucleus served as a base for the Sullan colonists. The electoral programmata and other inscriptions mention other pagi in the territory, which have not yet been identified. It is certain that the agricultural exploitation of the Pompeian, Nucerian and Stabian countryside continued over time until the fatal interruption. The number of the agricultural settlements is gradually increasing thanks to continuing excavations (Figure 28.1). As D'Arms 2 has already pointed out, we do not in any case know the respective size or the relationship between buildings and fields; for Villa Regina, an area between three and eight iugera of vineyards has been calculated on the basis of the capacity of the dolia (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Most of the buildings have rustic rooms, few with frescoed decorations, a sign that the presence of the owner was probably occasional. Sometimes the decoration is quite costly, as in the \"tablinum\" of the farm at Carmiano 1963, with a Third-Style Bacchic scene; or at Terzigno (Boccia al Mauro), with Second-Style megalographic paintings (1997 excavations). There are plenty of simple decorations that allude to the tutelary gods of the harvest, as in the farm of Villa Regina at Boscoreale; and signs of Egyptian cults, as in the Villa of Agrippa Postumus at Boscotrecase (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The principal crop was the vine; wine was traded in the western Mediterranean. Manpower was provided by slaves, as iron shackles attest, but it is possible that free peasants still survived. In addition to the farms, the territory was occupied by luxurious villas of otium: this typology expands from Cumae and Baiae southward along the coast of the Bay from some time in the first century BC, after the establishment of the Sullan colony. Villas of the kind can be suburban, as that attributed, without foundation, to the Pisones at Herculaneum, with its bronze and marble sculptures, in addition to some 1,800 papyrus scrolls mostly written upon in Greek. Farther from the city are the so-called villa of the Poppaei, at Oplontis (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), and that of San Marco at Stabiae, more recent than the destruction of that city by Sulla. Less well preserved, but of equal importance, is the villa at contrada Sora, Torre del Greco, from which come the relief with Orpheus and Eurydice, a replica of Praxiteles' Satyr Pouring, and a bronze of Hercules and the stag (the latter two in the Palermo museum). The villas situated inland, from that \"of the Mysteries\" to those attributed to P. Fannius Synistor, N. Popidius Florus (at Boscoreale), to Agrippa Postumus (at Boscotrecase), also include a rustica part, showing that they have combined two functions. The prevalent Second-Style decorations place the enlargement in the postcolonial phase. Both the precision and the size of the frescoed decorations and, when preserved, the artistic furnishings (from the villa \"of the Pisones\" to that of Oplontis) indicate the owners' high position. It should be recalled how landholdings were always being bought and sold for speculation, and for this reason it is difficult and probably useless to assign, as owners, names known from the sources (such as the matrona Rectina) to properties brought to light by archaeology. To make matters worse, the damage inflicted by the series of earthquakes preceding the eruption (of which at least that of AD 62 is known) will have brought about even more buying and selling. The fertility of the soils and the favorable opportunities for trade caused the Pompeian countryside to be densely populated: Pliny records how enormous crowds from the farms took refuge at Stabiae, seeking to escape in boats. After AD 79 came a period of total abandonment, not least because the volcanic debris impeded people's movement near the coast. Nocera equipped itself with an outlet at Vietri sul Mare, picking up again the archaic axis of communication on which Marcina was located. There is evidence of subsequent life in the territory of Pompeii, even in the immediate vicinity of the Porta Vesuvio. The roads from Nocera to the embarkation at Stabiae were reopened, and Stabiae continued to be occupied until late antiquity, as numerous burials and a Hadrianic mile post attest.",

I have been unable to convince myself of the correctness of Dickins's observation with regard to the Otricoli Zeus; in its present state it would not be possible to be sure of all details without a thorough cleaning of the surface and practically a microscopic examination; but my own observations are as follows: The whole back of the head, and the back part of the locks, except at the base, is modern, and of stucco. As to the locks above the upper, left part of the God's face, which are probably those meant by Dickins, it is not possible to affirm positively that they are not of stucco; I believe however that they are of marble, original, and broken off from the main block; there is a modern patch of marble at the left temple. Of marble and of one piece with the face is the inner part of the God's right group of curls, for the entire side of the face. The rest of the outer portion of the locks, on both sides of the face, is modern and I believe of marble; this includes the extreme left side of the face. All the beard is original, of marble, and of one piece with the face. The upper left eyelid and the tip of the nose are restored in marble, and the neck, bust, drapery, and the lower part of the locks, are also modern marble work. There has apparently also been considerable cleaning of the original surface, and I think some piecing out and smearing with stucco or other preparations on parts of the modern marble as well. Very noticeable is the difference in spirit between the ancient and the modern portions of the locks of hair. 3 Pages 70 f. 4 Page 71, note 3; I am credibly informed that this piece was formerly kept in the storerooms of the excavation, whence it was brought to its present place. 5 This is in accordance with the usual practice at the beginning of the Empire, as observed by AEM.

The manuals recognise quite correctly that the present form of the Porta Marina due, first to the rebuilding of the gate proper in the second century B. C., and then t addition of the inner rooms and the long arched passage probably in the early yea Sulla's colony; the remains of private structures immediately outside the gate nat date from the last period before the eruption. This leads to a consideration of the theory developed by A. Sogliano 3, that t originally no entrance at the Porta d'Ercolano, and none in fact at that point derstand his meaning -earlier than the present structure. The latter supposition is not tenable in view of the evidence afforded partly by the alignment of certa outside the gate, and still more by the manner in which the well-built stone str the wall is interrupted: the original gate lay a few feet further to the west than t 1 Rendiconti dei Lincei, Classe Scienze Mor., Stor. e Fil., Ser.

Besides, the presence of an extensive Samnite necropolis and left of the highway as one goes from the Porta d'Ercolano a strong presumption in the same sense. While we do not possess the elements for appraising the d this point, still the above-mentioned evidence for the presence times tends seriously to weaken the force of Sogliano's theory2 of the city: namely, that the cardo was the Strada Stabiana, an Nolana (for which he assumes a gate at the west end as we east) and the Strada dell'Abbondanza. When writing his article anist did not have access to my proposal 3 to recognise in the degli Augustali, and the southern part of the Strada Stabiana, t dating the Etruscan town-plan; I once more recommend this su of scholars, in the belief that it offers the solution of severa light on early conditions at this site. My suggestion that th Etruscan cardo had of course been advanced before, as the ide appears to have rejected it because the north end of this stre not a gate, in the city wall; and he might have added that th end either; but it should be remembered that both the tower t the south date from a period far later than that with which builders of the tower would have chosen the position as command If there was originally a gate at each end of this cardo, topog have made it ceremonial or decorative rather than utilitarian would have been for it to fall into neglect and eventually to b in imagining this is certainly no greater than that involved i the western end of the Strada di Nola . V. -THE APSE ARCH OF THE K OFFICES OF THE DUOVIRI ,. The easternmost of the three public buildings at the south end of the Forum is no conspicuous for the high arch, in large part preserved 6, which separates its apse from Pompeii. Repeated and careful ocular observation from the ground, at intervals of six months or a year, has convinced me that it showed a normal form of semicircular arch, consisting of two concentric half-circles of tiles, the outer set of which however was not solid but merely faced the two surfaces of the wall. The inner series of tiles has been uniformly removed or destroyed, probably by the survivors of the catastrophe, who discovered that there lay here ready to their hand a quantity of large pieces of tile suitable for use in their own building operations. The photograph (P1. 59, Fig. 1) shows that this operation has exposed the concrete body of the concavity of the arch, as distinguished from its facing of tiles; if we allow one foot or more for the tiles that were once in position, the result will be the original circle which took up the lines of the wall-ends on which the arch rests. The circle of tiles which is seen at present consists of the original second circle, which reinforced the circle now lost, but on the surfaces only of the walls; below the springing of the arch, the facing-tiles of the walls were hacked away to an amount of fifteen courses on the east wall and fourteen courses on the west wall. The result has been to give the impression to the spectator that the curve of the arch was continued for more than 1800, that is to say, that we have here a ((horse-shoe arch )); and in fact this has been called the earliest known example of the type to be found in Italy'. That this was not however the intention of the makers appears to be established by the observations summarised above. The peculiar plan of this structure is shown in the handbooks 2; there is a symm arrangement of the large curved niche and the two small rectangular ones on each the great door. Our Plate, 59, Fig. 2 uniform positions over the brick surface, as well as traces of marble wedges for attachment, show that the whole front sur with marble; at the bases in the niches, the bronze inscriptio to this marble surface.

The Villa of Diomed affords a splendid instance of several of the elements of Var aviary: a large rectangular area, surrounded by porticoes, in the axis of which there i pool and a pergula adapted for banquets: in this case the dining room was not on an is in the pool, but adjoining the latter.

    "full_text": "Explosive volcanic eruptions typically show a huge column of ash and debris ejected into the stratosphere, crackling with lightning. Yet equally hazardous are the fast moving avalanches of hot gas and rock that can rush down the volcano's flanks at speeds approaching 280 kilometers per hour. Called pyroclastic flows, these surges can reach temperatures of 400ºC. Fast currents and hot temperatures can quickly overwhelm communities living in the shadow of volcanoes, such as what happened to Pompeii and Herculaneum after the 79 C.E. eruption of Italy's Mount Vesuvius or to Saint-Pierre after Martinique's Mount Pelée erupted in 1902. The ability to detect volcanic explosions and track pyroclastic flows in a timely fashion is crucial to volcano monitoring operations and can positively affect risk management on many volcanoes, particularly those where collapsing lava domes tend to trigger pyroclastic flows. Increasingly, monitoring active explosive volcanoes involves studying infrasound. Infrasound is the low-frequency component of sound, ranging from 0.001 to about 20 hertz, below the human threshold of hearing. Many natural phenomena such as earthquakes, avalanches, landslides, tornadoes, and tsunamis are efficient sources of infrasound. Volcanoes are especially prolific infrasonic radiators: On active explosive volcanoes, volumetric sources rapidly expanding in the atmosphere produce infrasound, providing valuable insights into eruption dynamics. In particular, volcanoes characterized by lava dome growth exhibit infrasound generated by nonexplosive sources related to dome collapses, such as pyroclastic flows (Yamasato, 1997), rockfalls (Moran et al., 2008), and lahars. Such acoustic monitoring is fast becoming a standard technique on active volcanoes worldwide because of its potential to rapidly assess eruptive activity. The Soufrière Hills volcano (SHV), on the West Indies island of Montserrat, represents one of the best examples of a hazardous volcano that can be readily monitored through infrasonic studies. After several centuries of quiescence, SHV explosively erupted in 1995 and has since followed a characteristic cycle of dome growth and collapse activity accompanied by explosions and pyroclastic flows (Young et al., 1998). Large domes and kilometers-high explosive columns have collapsed multiple times, generating large and devastating pyroclastic density currents that thus far have killed 19 people, destroyed the capital city of Plymouth, overrun its airport, forced its total evacuation, and prompted more than half of the island's population to leave. At present, a lava dome with a volume of about 200 million cubic meters stands at the summit of SHV (Anon, n.d.). It is capable of collapsing and exploding at any time. To help provide adequate warning of volcanic hazards, the monitoring system at SHV was recently enhanced with the installation of a permanent small-aperture infrasonic array less than 3 kilometers away from the lava dome. This array has already proved its ability to detect explosive eruptions and track pyroclastic flows in real time, improving the efficiency of the response of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) during eruption crises and providing useful data that will help to constrain theoretical models aimed at unraveling the complex dynamics of pyroclastic flow propagation. Volcano acoustic studies, to date, have dealt mostly with analyzing different types of volcanic explosions, including those where ash jets high into the atmosphere (Plinian and sub-Plinian eruptions), those where lava and ash fountain to modest altitudes (Strombolian eruptions), and those where lava fragments are ejected in frequent cannon-like bursts due to the presence of water in the magma chamber (Vulcanian eruptions). Infrasonic arrays at regional distances have also been used to detect and track atmospheric injection of volcanic ash (Garcés et al., 2007). Little is known about the infrasonic wavefield associated with the emplacement of pyroclastic flows and other density currents (such as avalanches and landslides), all of which are characterized by nonstationary, extended infrasonic sources that introduce a high level of complexity in data processing schemes and theoretical modeling. The infrasonic array on Montserrat represents the first effort to tackle data processing issues by using state-of-the-art technology to monitor and track pyroclastic flows in real time. The infrasonic array was installed at a distance of about 3 kilometers from the active lava dome on SHV, at the Saint George's Hill site (Figure 1a). The full deployment of the array required 4 days of work by a team of five people. The array, with a total installation cost similar to that of two digital broadband seismic stations, has an aperture of 200 meters and a \"star\" geometry of three satellite sensors located 100 meters from a central station that includes two additional absolute pressure sensors along with the array receiver unit. Each of the satellite sensors is linked to the receiver unit by fiber-optic cables. The use of fiber-optic technology provides optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and ensures network integrity against atmospheric agents such as lightning. Strong winds, blowing mainly from east to west, introduce large noise contamination to signals. These were reduced by burying the sensors 1 meter underground. A gooseneck pipe, open at both ends, provides coupling of the infrasonic sensors to the atmosphere. Each satellite element of the array is equipped with a sensitive infrasonic microphone as well as temperature and voltage sensors. The high-resolution data acquired are sent, via radio modem, to the MVO offices where they are processed in real time and archived. The array works as a sonic antenna detecting small-amplitude pressure waves and providing the direction ( back-azimuth) from which the sound emanates (Figure 2a). The source position of infrasonic signals is resolved by use of a grid search algorithm that calculates the statistical correlation (semblance) between predicted and observed time delays across the array (Figure 2c). On other volcanoes characterized by explosive degassing (e.g., Italy's Stromboli and Etna, Vanuatu's Yasur, and Chile's Villarica), this location procedure has proved to be able to detect in real time up to several million infrasonic events per year (Ripepe et al., 2007). On Montserrat, this technique has been adapted to detect and track pyroclastic density currents in a realtime fashion. Beginning in May 2008, SHV has produced small to intermediate explosions accompanied by the emplacement of pyroclastic flows that descended the western flanks of the volcanic edifice (Figure 1d). The SHV infrasonic array recorded clear signals lasting about 400-1500 seconds (Figure 1b) associated with the explosions and the propagation of pyroclastic fronts. Coherent infrasound across the array (Figure 1e) generally started with an impulsive onset and reached peak amplitudes of 20-30 pascals during the most vigorous phase of the event. The infrasound recorded at SHV is relatively broadband (0.4-7 hertz); the frequency of the dominant spectral peak scaled inversely to the size of the flow (Figure 2c), reflecting variable propagation dynamics and grain composition of the density currents. One of the most remarkable events occurred at 0338:13 UTC on 29 July 2008, when a large Vulcanian eruption produced a 12-kilometer-high ash column and set off significant pyroclastic activity on the western flanks of the volcano. Tracing back the infrasonic signals identified an initial source located on the western sector of the summit lava dome (Figure 2a). The most energetic phase of the flow was characterized by several rapid changes in the direction of infrasound propagation (Figure 2d), indicating that the pyroclastic front was moving away from the dome, toward the south-southwest, in the direction of Plymouth (Figure 2a). Analysis of the changing source of infrasonic signals shows that the flow traveled 855 meters in 24 secondsa rate of roughly 35 meters per second. Variations to infrasound were observed multiple times (Figure 2d) during the high-amplitude infrasonic phase, reflecting distinct pulses in flow activity. The estimated speed of each flow ranged between 35 and 75 meters per second, in good agreement with previous measurements of pyroclastic flows calculated at Japan's Unzen volcano (Yamasato, 1997). For many years, real-time monitoring of the activity at SHV has been based solely With the motto \"Knowledge is the common wealth of humanity,\" the 2007-2008 Electronic Geophysical Year (eGY) advocated that scientists have the responsibility to create and implement strategies that utilize the full potential of digital capabilities in providing information for present and future generations. Although eGY has officially ended, the geomagnetic research community continues to support the goals of eGY through a global ground-based magnetometer initiative. This initiative, called SuperMAG, helps scientists have easy access to measurements of the Earth's magnetic field. SuperMAG is a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies that currently operate more than 200 ground-based magnetometers. It provides measurements of magnetic field perturbations from all available stations in the same coordinate system, with identical time resolution and a common baseline removal approach. SuperMAG utilizes vector measurements of the magnetic field, which represent a variety of file formats, temporal resolutions, units, and coordinate systems, and are provided with or without baseline subtracted. SuperMAG resamples the raw data to 1-minute temporal resolution and converts all units into nanoteslas (nT). Artifacts and errors are removed by automated as well as manual correction routines. Data are then rotated into a local geomagnetic coordinate system, and finally the baseline is subtracted by an automated technique. Before SuperMAG, global or even local studies required painstaking and laborintensive data handling, which effectively limited research. Analysts faced several inherent complications: confusing or even unknown coordinate systems, a multitude of data artifacts and errors, unknown baselines, and even difficulties obtaining data. These problems have resulted in a serious underutilization of data from magnetometers. Now the collected and processed high-quality ground-based magnetic field data provide an easier way to globally study magnetic data. SuperMAG offers the unique opportunity to address the global spatiotemporal behavior of the large-scale ionospheric electric current system and its coupling to the magnetosphere. Studies of the variations caused by electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere require a subtraction of the dominant and slowly varying Earth main field. Hence, both absolute and variometer data (data with unknown baselines) are included in SuperMAG. SuperMAG is intended to be a collaboration of all organizations operating groundbased magnetometer stations. Users must register with the SuperMAG site (http:// supermag . jhuapl . edu/) to have access to a variety of data plots and products. As an added and much needed benefit, the registration system incorporates a logging system that allows the usage statistics of individual users to be tracked, providing principal investigators with the feedback needed to justify future funding from their respective supporting agencies. Beyond the research community, Super-MAG targets the general public, in particular, teachers and students. This puts additional requirements on the site because these groups cannot be assumed to have extensive knowledge of either the data set or the underlying physics. Consequently, the SuperMAG's Web service is based on an intuitive interface with easily accessible tools and products. This is in line with the eGY declaration that states, \"providing ready and open access to the vast and growing collections of cross-disciplinary digital information is the key to understanding and responding to complex Earth system phenomena that influence human survival\" [see (Anon, n.d.). Although humankind is likely on the interpretation of seismic records and visual observations. Visual observations during the night are limited; the huge gas and ash columns towering above the edifice during large Vulcanian explosions and the hazardous pyroclastic flows running from the summit along the flanks of the volcano are not visible to the human eye. Thus, infrasonic monitoring at SHV has proven its great value, especially during severe weather conditions when visual observations were precluded and alternative means for identifying the onset of an eruption were limited, as during the 29 July 2008 eruption. The use of infrasound technology has positively influenced monitoring operations at MVO, allowing scientists to be able to make more informed decisions during eruptive crises. Thus far, flows have run in the direction of Plymouth, now a ghost town. But pyroclastic flows could run northeast toward inhabited villages-in such a case, quick detection and a precise monitoring system will allow MVO researchers to resolve some ambiguities in the assessment of the eruptive activity. Local infrasound monitoring exhibits a great potential for integration with other geophysical measurements, particularly seismic, and may assist with their interpretation by yielding information on the mechanisms of eruptions and the propagation of density currents (Moran et al., 2008). Its continued use can yield important dividends in the assessment of volcano-related hazards and the management of civil protection operations on Montserrat, as well as at other volcanoes worldwide.

    "full_text": "The eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD caused extensive destructions all over the Campanian area, engulfing the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplonti and Stabiae. The eruption followed a long quiescence period and the inhabitants of the area were surprised by the volcanic events. The first part of the eruption was characterized by a widespread dispersal of pumices from a high eruptive column. The second part of the eruption, characterized by pyroclastic flows emplacement, caused the major damages with extensive life losses in most of the towns surrounding the volcano. In Pompeii, the major casualties during the first phase resulted from roof collapses; during the second phase, people were killed either by physical trauma due to the kinetic energy of the flow or by suffucation because of the ash-rich atmosphere. Vesuvius is one of the most studied volcanoes in the world, because of its long time interval with historic eruptions (2000 years), its easy accessibility, and the first well-documented historic explosive eruption: that of 79 AD. The eruption destroyed Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplonti and Stabiae and caused the death of Pliny the Elder among many other people. Before the eruption, earthquakes occurred for some time, but were disregarded by local inhabitants because of their familiarity with the phenomenon. As the younger Pliny testified, \"for several days before (the eruption) the earth had been shaken, but this fact did not cause fear because this was a feature commonly observed in Campania\". The effects of these earthquakes are still visible in several buildings in Pompeii, and Villa Regina, where hastened repair works were underway in the days immediately preceeding the eruption. The main phases of the eruption have been described by Pliny the Younger, who observed the eruption from a distance of more than 25 km, basing also on contemporary testimonies and closer view accounts, especially for what regards the death of the uncle, Pliny the Elder, gone to the rescue of the inhabitants of the area. The beginning of the eruption is uncertain: the two Plinys observed the cloud at the seventh hour of the day (1 PM). We must presume that the eruption began sometime earlier to allow the arrival, at about the same hour, of a messenger sent from the Vesuvian area. The eruptive cloud was directly observed from Misenum at a distance of 21 km, so that they could fully appreciate its total extent and behavior. (\"It resembled a pine [Mediterranean pine] more than any other tree. Like a very high tree, the cloud went high and expanded in different branches. I believe, because it was first driven by a sudden gust of air then, with its diminution or because of the weight, the cloud expanded laterally, sometimes white, sometimes dark and stained by the sustained sand and ash\". During the night of the first day of the eruption, and for most of the morning of the next day, the houses of Misenum were shaken by earthquakes that caused much panic. In the morning of the second day of eruption, Pliny the Younger observed the development of pyroclastic flows descending down the flanks of Vesuvius and flowing on the sea. \"From the other side, black and horrible clouds, broken by sinuous shapes of flaming winds, were opening with long tongues of fire … . After a little while descended onto the land, opened the sea, covered Capri and prevented the sight of Misenum …\" The sequence of events described by the Younger Pliny fits well the geologic record of the eruption (Lirer et al., 1973)(Sigurdsson et al., 1985). We can summaryze the temporal evolution of the eruption into major phases which are typical of most large scale explosive eruptions. 1 The first phase, after minor phreatic explosions, is characterized by the development of an high, sustained column where the erupted mixture of juvenile gases and pyroclasts, mixing turbulently with atmospheric air, rises convectively into the stratosphere reaching an estimated maximum height of 32 km. 2 The second phase is characterized by the collapse of the eruptive column with the emplacement of pyroclastic flows and surges which destroyed every settlement within a radius of 10-15 km from the volcano. 3 Collapse of the magma chamber, ingression of water into the feeding system, magma water interaction and final phreato-magmatic activity. 4 Post-eruption remobilization of ashes and pumice by rain water during the following years. The four phases are identified by their typical deposits (Figure 1). • The first phase produced a fall deposits consisting of a lower part of well-sorted white pumice and an upper part of gray pumice dispersed to the southeast of the volcano and traced on land to a distance of more than 70 km (Lirer et al., 1973). • The deposits of the second phase consist of surge deposits made of layers of thin, poorly-sorted ash with cross bedding, and dune structures alternated with pyroclastic flow deposits made by thick and massive layers partly indurated and poorly sorted (Sigurdsson et al., 1985). • Silty sands beds with abundant accretionary lapilli form the deposit of the third phase. In proximal areas a debris flow deposit consisting of angular lava and carbonate blocks supported by an ash matrix with minor pumices is correlated with this phase (Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Sheridan et al., 1981). by Lisetta Giacomelli 1, Annamaria Perrotta 2 , Roberto Scandone 3 , and Claudio Scarpati 2 The eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD and its impact on human environment in Pompeii 1 Gruppo Nazionale di Vulcanologia, Via Nizza 128, 00193 Roma, Italy. 2 Dipartimento di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Largo San Marcellino 10, 80138, Napoli, Italy. 3 Dipartimento di Fisica, Università di Roma Tre, 00146, Roma, Italy. • The deposits of the fourth phase are a succession of lahars made up of a conglomerate composed of coarse pebbles with a matrix composed of small pebbles and coarse sand (Lirer et al., 2001). (Carey & Sigurdsson, 1987) estimated the height of the eruption column during the development of the Plinian phase basing on the isopleth distribution of maximum diameters of pumice and lithic fragments. They estimated that the eruption column rose from an height of 14 km to 26 km during the emission of white pumice and then to 32 km during the emission of grey pumice immediately before the deposition of pyroclastic flows. The estimates of the column heights permitted the evaluation of the corresponding magma discharge rates. Scandone and Giacomelli (2001) used the estimates of (Carey & Sigurdsson, 1987) to evaluate the temporal evolution of the eruption fed by a 7-12 km deep magma chamber. The progressive removal of magma in the course of the eruption caused a slow boiling of magma within the chamber because of decompression. This in turn produced a faster and faster emission rate until the final collapse of the wall surrounding the reservoir. Scandone and (Giacomelli & Scandone, 2001) evaluated the duration of the first phase at approximately 22 hours (several hours longer than previously estimated basing on average effusion rates). During this phase there was a steady increase in magma discharge rate. The second and most destructive phase with the massive emplacement of the major pyroclastic flows and surges lasted only about 5-6 hours. The city of Pompeii was destroyed and many of its inhabitants were killed during the 79 AD eruption. Several authors have reconstructed the succession of products emplaced during the eruption (e.g. (Lirer et al., 1973)(Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Carey & Sigurdsson, 1987) but the stratigraphic framework used here largely follows that of (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) which specifically studied the impact of this eruption on Pompeii. In the following paragraphs we summarise the damage suffered by population and buildings during the first two phases of the eruption and report the stratigraphic height at which were recovered human bodies and crumbled walls. The main sedimentological characteristics of the 79 AD deposit are reported in Figure 2. On the basis of these characteristics the deposit has been subdivided in 8 units named A to H from base upwards; a soil at the top of the sequence (unit I) is also reported. The state of the buildings all over the city is summarised in the following observations: a) the amount of destruction is not the same throughout the city, some buildings were more affected than others; b) the northern (relatively proximal) and southern (relatively distal) sectors in the city were generally affected in the same way; c) the ground floor is partly intact in most of the buildings, whereas the upper floor is almost completely demolished; d) the E-W oriented walls are by far more damaged than those striking N-S; e) in many cases, the northern vent-facing part of the buildings was more damaged than the southern one; f) most of the destruction is stratigraphically related to unit E. As shown in Table 1, 394 corpses were found in the pumice fall deposit and 650 in the pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) deposit. So a total of 1044 victims were recovered inside 2/3 of the city of Pompeii (the excavated part). Other 100 victims are estimated on the basis of many groups of scattered bones. Finally, considering the regions partially excavated (I, III, IV, V, IX) an estimate of 464 corpses still buried is obtained. Furthermore, it is meaningful to document the amount of victims with respect to their location (e.g. inside or outside the buildings). Most of the corpses within the pumice fall deposit were found inside buildings (80% as shown in Table 1), whereas of the 650 corpses recovered in the PDCs deposit 334 were found inside buildings and 316 outdoor (Table 1). (Anon, n.d.), on the basis of recent excavation, state that all human casts in the PDCs deposit lie over the well-recognisable lithic-rich unit D, enclosed within unit E (Figure 2). These corpses are mostly intact and only few corpses are partially or fully dismembered. In the still preserved outcrops of Pompeii and in the photographs of the Pompeii Archive, most of the casts lay prone in the attempt to shelter their face; it is noteworthy that in some places (e.g. garden of fugitives, Regio I, Insula 21; Stabian house, Regio I Insula 22) human casts show the head and the bust supported by arms, with this raised part of the body at higher stratigraphic level within E1. The process of Pompeii's destruction and burial started with the accumulation of a thick pumice lapilli deposit (layers A and B in Figure 1) resulting from the column fallout. The rate of deposition in the city ranged from 15 cm per hour in open areas to 25/30 cm per hour in places accumulating additional pyroclasts rolling from the steeper roofs. Within six hours from the beginning of the eruption the roofs and part of the walls of the buildings had collapsed under the pumice load. By the morning of 25 August most structures were seriously damaged; the pumice fall deposit, generally 3 m thick, totally buried the lower part of the buildings. The percentage of victims (38%) found in this deposit at Pompeii is anomalously high with respect to a mean of 4% of deaths caused by tephra fallout in the last four centuries during explosive eruptions (Anon, 1984)(Tanguy et al., 1999). This high percentage of deaths is possibly due to the attempt of some people to take shelter into buildings where roofs and walls collapsed under the load of the pyroclastic material. The small percentage of people found dead outdoor within the pumice fall deposit was probably killed by the crumbling roof tiles or by the largest lithic fragments following ballistic paths. The first PDC flowed through the city depositing the basal ash layer C and causing irrelevant damages. Based on the evidence that all of the human remains lie above this deposit, it can be deduced that people were not killed by the earlier PDC (units S4 and S5 of (Sigurdsson et al., 1985). The inhabitants survived also to the successive fallout phase that emplaced the lithic-rich layer D and some Table 1 Total of corpses found in the pumice fall deposit and in the stratified ash and pumice PDCs deposit (into buildings and outdoor places) at Pompeii.

In fact, we found the victims several centimetres above the base of this unit. Possibly, the parental pyroclastic current ran over the city with a low-temperature, dilute frontal part settling progressively few centimetres of ash. The rear part of the current had a non-uniform behaviour in terms of concentration, possibly due to the canalization of the basal part of the current along the longitudinal walls of the buildings. Inside these areas the current showed a greater destructive power, flattening most of the (especially transversal) walls, standing out of the pumice fallout deposit, in its north-south path. In the areas outside the channels the current had essentially a depositional behaviour engulfing the city and suffocating the inhabitants. These opposed behaviour of the PDC in very close areas testify to the different kinetic conditions undergone by the Pompeii inhabitants and hence the different physical integrity of their corpses. Observations on objects, cloths, frescoes and skeletons rule out the possibility that burn injuries contributed to kill Pompeii inhabitants, as recently proposed for Herculaneum inhabitants (Anon, n.d.)(Mastrolorenzo et al., 2001). Furthermore, the proposed non-uniform behaviour of PDCs, due to the interaction with the urban structures, justifies the described different state of destruction of the buildings throughout the city. A final phreatomagmatic phase, punctuated by two minor lithic fall episodes, emplaced the upper part of the succession (F to H units). Field features, such as the presence of accretionary lapilli in the upper part of the ash and pumice deposit and the lack of high temperature evidences in the buildings, support the idea of low emplacement temperature for the pyroclastic currents during the final phase of the eruption.",

    "full_text": "Towns and urban life have existed for a very long time, well before the Romans, and yet they came to represent a quintessential feature of the Roman world. Throughout Antiquity most of the population lived in the open countryside, but their settlements and lives almost invariably gravitated around -and indeed supported -a sprawling network of towns. Their relationship was very much symbiotic as urban sites 'were administrative centres, they were garrison towns, they were centres of exchange both as between towns and regions, and between townsmen and the surrounding countryside' (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The specific conditions brought about by the Roman political unification of a vast empire could not but enhance the role towns played in connecting peoples and cultures, easing the (re)distribution of resources whilst extending the reach of political control and effective administration. Even more than this, the Roman empire could not have existed the way it did without towns and urban life: to understand Roman urbanism is to understand a fundamental dimension of Roman civilization. Luckily for us, the sources at our disposal for the study of Roman urbanism are numerous, varied and -as this volume attests -ever-increasing. Towns not only occupied central stage in the lives of the literate elite whose accounts are preserved in ancient texts, but they left plenty of archaeological traces. The exploration of individual urban sites has undoubtedly added the most to our understanding of Roman urbanism, highlighting not only recurring features, but also the varied range of solutions adopted by different people in different places at different times. These individual studies, and the specific evidence they are based on, constitute the very foundation without which no synthesis of higher level could effectively exist (Anon, n.d.). The study of Roman urbanism -especially its early (Republican) phases -is indeed extensively rooted in the evidence provided by a series of key sites, several of them located in Italy. Some of these Italian towns have received a great deal of scholarly attention in the past and they are routinely referenced as 'textbook examples' in scholarly discussion, framing much of our understanding of the broad phenomenon of Roman urbanism (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). However, some discussions of these sites tend to fall back on well-established interpretations, with relatively little or no awareness of more recent developments. This is remarkable, since our understanding of these sites has evolved significantly thanks to new archaeological fieldwork, often characterised by the pursuit of new questions and the application of new approaches. Similarly, new evidence from other sites has prompted a reconsideration of time-honoured views about the nature, role and long-term trajectory of Roman towns in Italy. This awareness lies behind the decision to devote the 2022 Laurence Seminar to a conversation about Roman Urbanism in Italy: recent discoveries and new directions. This event, which took place at the Faculty of Classics of the University of Cambridge on 27-28 May 2022, aimed at bringing together scholars whose recent work at key sites is helping to expand, change or challenge our current knowledge and understanding of Roman urbanism in Italy. The selection of case-studies was also guided by the desire to offer as representative a picture as possible of Roman urbanism in Italy, in terms of variety of urban types, chronological range (Mid Republic to Late Antiquity -and beyond), and geographic coverage (North, Central and Southern Italy; both Tyrrhenian and Adriatic side of the Peninsula). The individual contributions were grouped thematically, and this structure is reflected in the parts in which this volume is divided. The body of available evidence for the study of Roman urbanism has been steadily increasing, thanks in no little part to the integrated application of new approaches (Part I). As several of the contributions in this volume make clear, remote sensing has played a crucial role in this. The case of Falerii Novi (Anon, n.d.) is especially notable: one of the earliest Roman towns to be subjected to full-scale geophysical prospection, it provides concrete illustration not only of what these methods can reveal about the layout of ancient cities, but also the range of questions such evidence can be used to answer. The systematic application of non-intrusive methodologies within an overbuilt environment and the integration of different datasets is what allowed the 'Rome Transformed Project' (Anon, n.d.) to reconstruct and visualise the development of a sector of Rome's periphery, the eastern Caelian, in the 1st-2nd centuries AD. It is indeed by combining and integrating a varied range of archaeological approaches, methods and techniques -and their resulting evidence -that best results can be obtained, as illustrated by ongoing fieldwork at Aquinum (Anon, n.d.). The availability of new evidence is naturally bound to affect existing interpretations, even in the case of those 'textbook sites' whose understanding is often taken as more or less established (Part II). Nowhere this is more evident than at Cosa (Anon, n.d.), a site which has much contributed to framing the study of Roman urbanism generally, and (Latin) colonies specifically: once again its interpretation is being enriched by new data, prompting a further reappraisal of its early phases. At Fregellae (Anon, n.d.), a unique site due to its being a 'closed context' from the Republican period, a review of the available evidence and associated documentation provides new insights about the development of key buildings and aspects of daily life in a period which is not particularly well known. New work around the forum of Alba Fucens (Anon, n.d.) has expanded our understanding of this other important site, providing new evidence of the monumental transformation undergone by the town at the end of the Republic and during the Principate. Recent work has further confirmed the varied range of urban solutions adopted across Roman Italy in response to local conditions (Part III). Not the only site known to have done so, Lucus Feroniae (Anon, n.d.) featured the bare essentials of a Roman town (i.e. a forum and a series of public buildings around it) even though it served a fundamentally rural population living dispersed in the countryside. As the case of Septempeda makes clear (Anon, n.d.), the process of town formation could vary significantly, and new towns could develop organically as a local initiative aimed at taking advantage of the territorial infrastructure promoted by the Romans. As conditions changed, so did towns. The long-term development of Roman urbanism therefore reflects -and may thus be used to illuminate -broader transformations taking place both locally and across Italy more generally (Part IV). Recent excavations at Lunae (Anon, n.d.) have revealed a series of distinctive phases of occupation that are quite indicative of the general development of the town. A combination of full-coverage geophysical prospection, systematic analysis of the ploughsoil assemblage and excavation has made it possible to outline the long-term trajectory of Interamna Lirenas (Anon, n.d.), with potential implications for our understanding of Italy in the 2nd century AD. Comparable patterns have been identified at Aeclanum (Anon, n.d.), another relatively small town whose place in relation to the communication network guaranteed its success, particularly from the 2nd century AD onwards. As several Roman towns continued to be occupied in the Late Antique and medieval periods, these changes became even more significant (Part V). However, patterns of both continuity and marked transformation are attested at Aquileia (Anon, n.d.), whose strategic position guaranteed its continued relevance in relation to trade and supply in the 4th-5th centuries AD. The crucial importance of Parma (Anon, n.d.) in relation to the communication network can be clearly appreciated when considering the long and articulated history of its bridge -or rather bridges -along the route of the via Aemilia. Notwithstanding the thematic organization adopted by this volume, the significance of each of these case studies is undoubtedly much broader. All these recent discoveries can indeed contribute to review and revise our understanding of the development of Italy in the Roman period (Anon, n.d.). In this sense, we hope that this volume will provide not only an accessible and up-to-date overview of current approaches to the study of Roman urbanism, but also a useful resource for those researching the archaeology and history of Roman Italy. It is widely acknowledged that cities are fundamental to any understanding of the Roman empire. They were central to Rome's mode of administration, which had adapted to a world of slow and imperfect communications and which came to rely on distributed systems of political control that often integrated local social leaders. Furthermore, as nodes in the network of communications that thereby developed, they grew as centres of social systems and as key foci for economic activity. Hence, cities are central to the debates about the mechanisms behind the development and working of the Roman world. It is equally obvious that, whilst the amounts of textual and epigraphic evidence available are unlikely to increase, evidence produced by archaeological work is constantly growing, so one might hope that it has the potential to increase historical knowledge and enhance understanding. Whilst I remain optimistic that this is possible, I also believe that this will only happen if we are aware that any such progress relies not on simply producing more information from fieldwork, but in rethinking our questions and approaches. Recent trends in the analysis of archaeological data on an empire-wide scale (especially the Oxford Roman Economy Project: https://www.romaneconomy.ox.ac.uk) clearly illustrate some potential, although with our present imperfect data there is a danger that such studies may simply confirm the presuppositions of the analyst. This problem is perhaps illustrated in recent studies of Roman cities which support maximalist economic models whilst also tacitly assuming that all urban centres across the empire were essentially similar (Anon, 2016). For myself, I see the character of Roman urbanism as highly regionally variable, with the differences potentially providing key evidence for the nature of the changing social and economic structures within the Empire (Hay et al., 2010). On this basis, I think that a more profitable approach is to map and analyse urban structures through space and time. The challenge in doing this is that our evidential base is actually rather limited. Although there has long been an interest in the archaeology of Roman cities, such work has been heavily constrained. With the exception of the few places where there has been large-scale clearance of cities, mostly in locations that are not overlain by modern towns, we rely on interventions that have only sampled a small proportion of these ancient sites. Sampling theory shows that even very small sample(s) can be useful if they are truly representative of the 'population' under study, but only if we know, or can hypothesise, the relationship between the samples and the target 'population' and can assume that the target 'population' is homogeneous. This raises two issues for those using archaeological evidence of Roman urban centres. First, except in unusual circumstances, small excavation sites (our samples) are neither carefully selected to provide a representative sample, nor are they truly random samples. Instead, they are most often either situated as a result of modern development pressures -i.e. excavating in advance of building work -or located where an archaeologist thinks there is something interesting to investigate. Second, and important in cases where the archaeologist is deciding where to dig, our models of Roman urban centres have too often assumed that all Roman towns were basically similar in layout. This has led to excavations focusing on what are assumed to be key building types (most often the public monuments) or targeting areas at the centre of a town as these are assumed to be the most significant. This brings us back to the dominance in the literature of a limited number of extensively excavated towns -Pompeii and Ostia in Italy, and examples like Leptis in North Africa or Silchester in England -which have naturally dominated past thinking. In an era when scholars assumed that the Roman world was broadly homogenous, it was entirely reasonable to extrapolate from such widely explored examples and use them as models for the understanding of other sites, implicitly assuming that small, excavated examples could be interpreted in relation to them. Given our current knowledge of the heterogeneity of the Roman world, this approach is no longer tenable. On this basis, I would contend that we need both new approaches and different ways of thinking if we are to better understand both Roman towns and the dynamics of the Roman world itself. Excavation -when well conducted -provides very high resolution and granular evidence about comparatively small areas (i.e. samples of cities). It has the potential to allow us to understand the development through time of such areas, and -with the analysis of finds -to make inferences about the lifeways of the inhabitants, their economy and society. It essentially provides detail that is very localised and context specific. There are exceptions, notably projects that have involved the large-scale clearance of extensive areas of ancient cities like Pompeii or Ostia. In the past, these campaigns, however, have generally resulted in a much poorer quality of evidence, with issues of lack of chronological detail which limits the research that can now be done on the finds assemblages (e.g. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In both these cities, the benefits of the broad view of the urban landscape provided 2. Approaches to Roman urbanism in Italy: the example of Falerii Novi by large-scale clearance have allowed the creation of low resolution, big pictures (e.g. Lawrence 1994; Lawrence & Newsome 2011). The desire to enhance detail has also of course stimulated projects that are producing higher-resolution evidence of smaller sample areas within the cleared sites (e.g. Insula I.9.11-12, Pompeii: Fulford & Wallace-Hadrill 1999; Porta Stabia, Pompeii: https://classics.uc.edu/pompeii). Such complementary work is enhancing our understanding of these sites by treating previously cleared areas in new ways, often involving the stratigraphic recording of the standing structures as well as stratigraphic excavation within previously cleared areas. Such excellent work means that we have an increasingly sound understanding of these iconic sites. Alongside this, there is also a different trend, especially associated with studies of Pompeii, which has taken advantage of the large-scale of these cleared sites to look at overall patterns within the urban landscape, thereby characterising the townscape as a whole (Lawrence 1994). Archaeological remote sensing has been increasingly widely used in archaeology in Italy and elsewhere over the last 25 years or so as several of the papers in this volume illustrate (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2012). Although aerial photography has a long history as a research tool in Italy, it has only recently been widely used, whilst at the same time access to both satellite imagery and cheap drones has widened the scope of aerial mapping very considerably. The use of various geophysical survey methods on a large scale is also a recent phenomenon (Anon, n.d.), although small-scale experimental geophysical survey has a longer history in Italy. Electrical resistance survey has not been used much on a large scale, largely because of the dry soil conditions and the fact that it is comparatively slow, although the development of mechanized systems of data collection, especially in France, suggests that it may become more common (Anon, n.d.). Fluxgate gradiometry, measuring variations in the earth's magnetic field (and commonly referred to as magnetometry) has been much more widely used as the equipment has become widely available and data can be collected rapidly and without much difficulty. After the spectacular success of the survey at Falerii Novi in the 1990s (Anon, n.d.), a significant number of major urban sites in Italy have been surveyed using this method, with varying degrees of success (e.g. (Anon, n.d.). In aggregate, they have provided a mass of new evidence, much of it of a very high quality. The resolution of data collection has gradually improved, as has the software for processing, so we are now familiar with the types of greyscale images that map buried structures. More recently the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been used on an increasingly large scale. The technology has been under development for several years, but the cost of the equipment and the computing requirements for processing meant that it was generally only used on a small scale until the last decade. It can now be deployed on a large scale and this has produced some excellent results (Anon, n.d.). All these methods have the potential to provide large-scale evidence at high resolution across past urban landscapes. All work well on agricultural land, unencumbered by buildings, so they have been most valuable in mapping now deserted Roman town sites. GPR does have the potential to map areas beneath hard surfaces, and so has the capacity to allow us to map features in towns that are still occupied, even if that potential is only now beginning to be fully realised (Piro et al., 2020); also (Anon, n.d.). In general, the results from any method of remote sensing are constrained by a variety of factors, both inherent to the method and by the environment within which they are used. Hence, although in certain circumstances any particular method can produce visually spectacular results, in practice the evidence is invariably somewhat patchy, with the reasons for gaps in the data not always obvious. We therefore need to be careful about interpretation, and there is a general view amongst practitioners that we should ideally cover the same survey area with a variety of techniques to optimise the information obtained (Anon, n.d.). Even in these circumstances and with the best of results, we should also bear in mind that evidence from remote sensing has basic limitations. First, all the methods are best at mapping solid structures, so more ephemeral evidence -e.g. timber buildings or secondary modifications to buildingsare not generally visible. Second, all are most effective in mapping relatively shallowly buried deposits. Whilst the depth penetration varies between different environments and with the scale of the buried structures, in most archaeological work mapping is limited to the upper 1-2 m, so understanding very deeply stratified sites is generally very difficult, if not impossible. Finally, although GPR differentiates features at different depths below the surface, thus making it possible to develop hypotheses about the chronology of buried structures, for the most part, remote sensing provides rather two-dimensional images which effectively show a palimpsest which requires careful analysis if different phases of activity are to be differentiated. Even where this is possible, the dating of the different phases is impossible from the remote sensing data alone -we rely either on sample excavation to provide stratigraphic dating or on drawing parallels with excavated structures to identify and thus infer a chronology. It is also notable that although many geophysical surveys have now been completed and images published, the number of sites where the results have been fully analysed and critically evaluated remains remarkably small. These constraints do not mean that the results of such remote sensing surveys lack value, but they do mean that we need to think very carefully about how they can best be used. In doing this, I think it is important to appreciate also that excavation is not a universal panacea: the commonly held idea that digging a trench to examine a geophysical anomaly may be seen as 'ground-truthing' is false as it implies that excavation reveals an 'objective truth'. This is based on a positivist fallacy which will 2. Approaches to Roman urbanism in Italy: the example of Falerii Novi be obvious to anyone who has seriously wrestled with the analysis of the complex stratigraphy of an excavation. All archaeological interpretation is subjective and requires the careful weighing of different forms on evidence. Interpreting remote sensing data is no different, no more or less reliable that interpreting the stratigraphy in an excavated trench. Recognising this and understanding that we need to draw on the whole range of evidence available and weigh it very carefully are fundamental to good archaeological practice. Returning to the points made above about the nature of excavated evidence from sites like Pompeii that have been the subject of large-scale clearance, we can see parallels with the nature of the data from remote sensing. Essentially, this also provides low-resolution, large-scale data in which relative chronology is difficult to assess, but where spatial patterns are laid bare. In that sense, these data sets are comparable and provide potentially valuable insights into characterising Roman urban landscapes. Our work at Falerii Novi (Anon, n.d.)(Hay et al., 2010)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) provides an illustration both of the application of methods of remote sensing and of the ways in which that evidence can enable us to approach the subject of Roman urbanism in different ways. The site of Falerii Novi, which is now largely covered by farmland, offers a good opportunity to evaluate geophysical survey. The Roman town was established after Rome's destruction of its predecessor, now known as Falerii Veteres (Civita Castellana), following the Faliscan revolt in 241 BC. The new town was constructed some way to the West, astride the line of the via Amerina which was constructed to link Rome with Ameria (Amelia, Umbria) and ultimately Perusia (Perugia). According to the Byzantine writer Zonaras (Anon, n.d.), the site of the new town was chosen to make it less defensible than its predecessor. In the absence of the relevant section of Livy's narrative, it is difficult to evaluate this statement, but it has generally assumed that the refoundation of Falerii was part of Rome's pacification strategy. Aside from its imposing circuit of walls that are generally assumed to date to the period of its foundation, there is little of the Roman period now visible on the site. Following a series of excavations in the 1820s (evaluated by Di Stefano Manzella 1979), the only major exploration of the site came with unpublished excavations in 1969-75. In 1997-98 our team completed a survey of the available area within the walls, combining a fluxgate gradiometer survey with a topographic survey that enabled us to produce a close-interval contour map (Anon, n.d.). The resolution of the magnetic survey was comparatively low by present-day standards, but the results were excellent and the publication stimulated considerable interest and encouraged others to undertake similar work elsewhere in Italy. On the basis of an interpretation of the geophysical anomalies, we published an interpretative plan that mapped the street layout and buildings (Fig. 2.1), alongside a commentary that discussed the different buildings identified. Further work in the area outside the walls to the north, completed in 2008, complemented the intramural study (Hay et al., 2010), and I published a discussion paper which developed ideas about the suggested phasing for the development of the town plan based on an analysis of its layout (Fig. 2.2) (Millett, 2007). Whether or not the conclusions of that analysis were correct, the study did show how it was possible to use magnetic survey evidence as the basis for a broader historical discussion, and indeed this stimulated a response which proposed a slightly different sequence (Anon, n.d.). Following on from the initial geophysical survey there was some further work surveying the town walls (Anon, n.d.), whilst the whole area was successfully mapped using LiDAR data (Anon, n.d.). This work was followed up in 2015-17 by a new project that collected high resolution GPR data across the walled area (Plate 2.1, Figs 2. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). This project, Beneath the surface of Roman Republican cities (funded by the AHRC), involved innovative geophysical work undertaken Dr Lieven Verdonck of Ghent University, with the survey of Falerii Novi completed in parallel with comparable work at Interamna Lirenas (Anon, n.d.). 2. Approaches to Roman urbanism in Italy: the example of Falerii Novi (Anon, 2023)(Anon, n.d.). It produced outstandingly good results which complement and extend knowledge of the town plan provided by the magnetic survey (Anon, n.d.). A complete analysis of the results of this survey is soon to be published (Anon, n.d.), so I do not want to discuss the detail or methodology here. Instead I would like to draw on the results to highlight how we can use remote sensing data to think about Roman town plans in new and comparative ways. In doing this, we should acknowledge that we are generally relying on the use of analogies with excavated data in the identification and classification of particular building forms. Hence, the interpretations offered should be seen as models or hypotheses that should be critically evaluated using other data sets and alternative ideas. Only by doing this will ideas be refined. Building on the idea first developed in discussion of the magnetic survey data, a sequence for the development of the street grid now seems to have been broadly (Anon, n.d.). confirmed with the GPR survey (Fig. 2.2). This reveals that the first phase of the new town involved the laying out of a grid centred on an east-west axis along ridge parallel with the stream to the south. This was laid out three blocks wide (north-south) by seven blocks long (east-west), with the central set divided into pairs of smaller insulae by the east-west street (conventionally the decumanus maximus, although we should note that this terminology is a modern invention: (Anon, n.d.). The east-west street intersected with the via Amerina (conventionally the cardo maximus), at the entrance to the forum with three rows of insulae to its West and five rows to its east. It now seems likely that the insulae occupied by the forum were reserved for this purpose from the outset as the street that runs through this area identified in the magnetic survey has been shown by the GPR survey to be post-Roman in date. The axial east-west street passes through the East Gate and the so-called 'Porta di Giove' at the western limit of the town. On the highest point within the walls, just inside this gate, there is evidence for a major temple, interpreted as the capitolium. This location on the edge of the settlement and outside the street grid perhaps indicates that the temple was established at the foundation of the town and before the grid was laid out. It seems clear that after the establishment of the primary grid a routeway was laid out around it. This connected to the valley of the Rio dell Purgatorio at the southeast via the so-called Porta Puteana, and a shallow side valley, then followed the eastern, northern and western sides of the grid before linking back to the valley floor at the southwest via a now lost side gate. This seems to have formed a processional way that linked Falerii Novi back to the sanctuaries at Falerii Veteres. It seems most likely that this routeway was conceived of as part of the original planning of the new town, with the town wall built after it had come in to use, although Andrew (Anon, n.d.) has argued that the Wall predates the grid and this routeway. The final stage in the development of the grid involved the addition of a series of slightly less regular, but basically square insulae along the south side of the primary grid. These include various public buildings including baths and the theatre. The form of the theatre would perhaps imply that this expansion of the grid dates to the early imperial period. Within the grid plan, we can identify different patterns of house plots (Plate 2.1). These are broadly legible because of the scale and high resolution of the GPR survey despite there being substantial evidence for the long history of modification to many individual houses. It is notable that there are several types of building plot which broadly correlate with the proposed phasing of the plan. In the core area of primary grid we can identify a series of east-west properties laid out across the insulae. These are most clearly visible in the areas flanking the forum to the north and south. The widths of the plots, many of which are occupied by identifiable atrium houses, 2. Approaches to Roman urbanism in Italy: the example of Falerii Novi shows some variation in width. This may suggest that the allocation of plots was less regimented that in colonies (contrast with Interamna Lirenas: (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Elsewhere in the primary grid insulae were subdivided with a north-south division running through them. This is most clearly seen in the two rows of insulae at the eastern end of the grid where the east-west strips subdivided in this way were occupied by smaller houses. The regularity of this pattern suggests that it was part of the initial planning and implies social differentiation in the initial land allotment. Finally, the square insulae in the later grid to the south were divided into quarters, with some of the quarters further split in two. In contrast to the insulae in the primary grid, in these the house plots were not all aligned east-west but instead show a range of orientations although they are of standard sizes. This provides strong evidence for the systems of town planning and land allotment within the town, but this is less systematic than shown in colonies (as noted above). It seems likely that these irregularities indicate a more gradual pattern of development, perhaps with housing lots initially defined but only gradually being built upon. Nevertheless, the regularity of layout and allocation of space surely indicates the operation of a central authority, but one that may have been subtly different from that seen in contemporary colonies. The evidence of plot layouts and house types also provides a sound basis for the estimation of the urban population. In contrast to methods that rely on multiplying a proposed figure for average population density by the walled area (e.g. (Anon, n.d.), we are able to count the actual number of houses of different sizes and provide estimates based on the size of the group occupying them (Millett, 2013)(Anon, n.d.). Although this still leaves some margin of error as not all houses will have had the same number of occupants it enables much more rigorous assessment of population to be made, especially given the high resolution of the GPR survey. Similarly, the number and distribution of houses of different sizes provides evidence for the analysis of the town's social structure, and also comparison with other extensively known towns. We have already noted the oddity of the peripheral street, interpreted as a processional route, that runs round the primary grid (par 2.3.2; also par. 2.3.7), but the GPR survey also provides other information about routes through the town. The main north-south route along the via Amerina seems to have been key and this is reflected in its unusual width (Fig. 2.3). There remains a question about the slightly offset position of the North Gate, the evidence for which has been made clearer by the GPR survey, although its interpretation remains difficult. By contrast the east-west route along the ridge is less strongly emphasized and, indeed it is interrupted by the forum. Nevertheless, its importance in the western part of the town is shown by the location of public buildings including the forum itself, a macellum and the capitolium, all of which open on to it. In the eastern part of the town, street widths suggest that a key east-west route that avoids the forum but follows the southern and eastern sides of primary grid. This wider street has properties set back from the frontage, but it is not clear why this east-west route has a kink in it towards its eastern end. As well as the evidence for key thoroughfares, the GPR survey also shows streets that were constricted in some ways. Some features obstructing streets are probably street fountains, but there are also routes that seem to have been cut, with some structures built across streets. This is especially the case to the West of the via Amerina in the southern part of town. These encroachments provide key evidence 2. Approaches to Roman urbanism in Italy: the example of Falerii Novi for understanding the changing use of space within the town and its transformations through to the later Empire. Survey evidence is especially important for seeing overall patterns in the use of space across the whole townscape, and with the results of the GPR survey we have been able to identify a wide range of public buildings, even though the interpretation of some remains uncertain (Fig. 2.4). The principal public building and facilities identified (in addition to the temples discussed below) are the forum and basilica, two suites of baths, the theatre, the amphitheatre, two macella, a nymphaeum and the aqueduct. The disposition of these is partly determined by chronological factors. In general, and with the exception of the forum, there are few public buildings in the area of the primary grid, perhaps because it was largely occupied by private buildings from an early stage. The exceptions are the two macella, both of which lie on key thoroughfares but are comparatively marginal in their location and may be relatively late in date. The theatre and associated porticus as well as the two suites of baths lie in the area of the later southern extension to the grid. This, together with aspects of their design, suggests that they are later in date. Other factors, including the physical topography, may also have influenced the location of these public monuments, with the theatre's porticus situated in a slight hollow. The location of the baths is also likely to be related to access to the water supply. The aqueduct enters the town at the northwest, with its pipe raised high on a series of piers that brought the water in at the level of the top of the wall. The surface here lies at about 208 m a.s.l., meaning that the pipe was at c. 212 m a.s.l. The present surface in the area where the baths are both located is at about c. 203 m a.s.l., providing a good head of water and a reasonable operating pressure. Only parts of the town lie at or below this level, where any baths perhaps would need to have been located to maintain water pressure. Furthermore, they were also situated not far from the South Gate, the main entrance to the town from Rome and therefore convenient for travellers arriving from Rome. Perhaps the most surprising feature of Falerii Novi, as we now understand it through survey, is the extraordinary number of temples as well as their locational pattern (Fig. 2.5). We have identified ten likely temples in the town plan. Three of these are located in not unexpected positions -the probable capitolium lies at the highest point within the town facing south just inside the West Gate (the 'Porta di Giove'), whilst there is a temple axially situated in the middle of the eastern end of the forum square, with a third adjacent to this. The other temples are mostly peripheral within the town and show overlapping patterns of regularity. Several are in the northern half of the town with four of them adjacent to the irregular processional route that surround the primary grid, three of these (in addition to the capitolium) are known to face south. In addition to the capitolium, three temples are situated close to the principal gates while the final one is positioned to the southwest of the street intersection at the front of the forum. This, together with the two temples beside the South and West Gates, all face east. The liturgical and religious implications of these patterns of temple location and orientation are not presently understood but do seem clear and must surely be of significance for understanding the character of the town, which seems to have an unusually prominent religious topography. The peripheral situation of many of the temples is notable and raises the question of whether Falerii is unique or, alternatively, if a failure to explore marginal areas of other towns means that this is a common pattern that has previously escaped notice. 2. Approaches to Roman urbanism in Italy: the example of Falerii Novi I trust that this brief account has illustrated both the benefits of large-scale and high-resolution survey and also the need to think about the kinds of question that such evidence now allows us to ask about whole town plans. It is my belief that such surveys do not provide the same types of evidence as comes from excavation, but they are of equal value. The information that comes from high resolution remote sensing is thus complementary, giving extensive views and across whole townscapes which can and should be used for comparative urban research, opening up new ways of seeing and assessing variation in Roman urbanism. As research of this type increases, it is my hope that we will be able to explore the dynamics that led to the heterogenous patterns of Roman urban forms much more effectively, moving away from the hegemony of sites like Pompeii and Ostia, and thus understanding society in the Roman world more fully. 3. The changing face of the eastern Caelian in the 1st-4th centuries AD political, economic, religious, and military changes that reshaped society in between the 4th and 8th centuries AD. We see Rome's transformation differently; Rome was repeatedly transforming itself from its earliest days. The form of the city thus understood, while intimately bound up with shifts of power and ideology, is reshaped in terms not only of buildings added and removed, of expansion and of contraction, it is also a transformation in depth: of earth, debris, and subsurface infrastructure, builtup and, sometimes, excavated away. The dynamic remodelling of the city has produced a depth of archaeological deposits which present both remarkable opportunity and profound challenge. Accessing the evidence is one part of the challenge, synthesising and integrating it is another. A key consideration is, therefore, the ongoing need to develop systems that facilitate analysis in three and four dimensions, visualising not only plans and structural elevations, but also subsurface infrastructure, and the interconnected nature of changes through time. As students of Rome, we are indeed fortunate to work with a rich body of topographical research (Anon, 1997)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), but such research is constrained by the imaging of spaces and structures in two dimensions. What is true of the historiography of Rome's topography in general is no less true of our area. The research synthesised in Colini's magistral study of the (Anon, n.d.) and its updates (Anon, 2006)(Anon, 2009), and further explored by (Liverani, 1999)(Anon, n.d.), has been augmented by excellent studies of individual monuments and locations (Anon, 1937)(Anon, 1955)(Anon, 1993)(Anon, 2003)(Guidobaldi, 2004)(Brandt & Guidobaldi, 2008)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2015), which have also proven essential in our work. The challenges confronting researchers in the Caelian, as throughout Rome, and indeed in many of the world's great cities, are all linked to the need to work in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Centuries of development mean that elements of earlier buildings have been destroyed or are so deeply buried that their recovery is largely impossible. The same forces have obscured the natural topography to a degree that even the very contours of the hills which shaped the antique city are only very partially known. Yet for those who drove those developments, the locations of pre-existing buildings, together with the underlying contours, will have been of fundamental concern. As with every great city, there are multiple instances in the history of Rome when dramatic programmes of demolition and earth moving changed both the built and natural landscapes out of recognition: building programmes did not emerge in a vacuum. What existed before could be co-opted for symbolism, convenience and often with regards to both. Roads and city walls framed evolving spaces, of course, but less obviously -particularly when viewed through the prism of so many two-dimensional plans -terracing and the installation of water supply and drainage networks played a central and ongoing role in determining what can be developed successfully where. Subsurface engineering lay at the heart of what made many Roman cities distinctive, but its implications are still often underappreciated in much discussion of Roman urbanism. With these considerations in mind Rome Transformed has sought to develop a suite of integrated non-intrusive methodologies, many first trialled in the Lateran Project (Haynes et al., 2017)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Piro et al., 2020), to allow the changing form of the research area to be modelled. These were developed to allow integration of work above ground with that undertaken in subterranean areas, surrounded by complex exposed archaeology. With some twelve areas of what we call Open Historic Excavations in the Rome Transformed area, most inaccessible to the public, and many requiring special safety measures to enter, this experience proved invaluable. It has also proved essential in advancing research in otherwise undocumented pozzolana quarries. In addition to being of more general archaeological interest, these quarries sometimes reveal further structural evidence. Data capture consists of four strands: structural archaeology, geophysical survey, archival analysis and borehole survey. For ease of reference, the research area was divided into nine areas, on the basis of structural and functional coherence in property development. To aid readers these area codes are given in parentheses in this paper (Fig. 3.1). In addition to the depth challenge, a major consideration when undertaking structural analysis of the surviving archaeology is its scale. Amongst other buildings under investigation, for example, are two basilicas (1, 3), an amphitheatre (3), the Varian Circus (3) -the largest circus ever built in Rome -a particularly complex stretch of the Aurelian Wall (9), and extended elements of the Claudio-Neronian aqueduct (Anon, n.d.). This, and the commitment of the project to largely non-intrusive approaches, guided the selection of methods used. Mindful of the need to integrate all data within the same geospatial framework, the team generated digital clones through a comprehensive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry programme of all archaeology accessible above and below ground. Above ground, the surviving height of many of the structures necessitated the use of SfM based on UAVs, a complex task particularly in a busy urban area such as Rome. At ground-level and below, comprehensive TLS survey posed its own problems, requiring registration of chains of interlocking scans through often narrow passageways with limited lines of sight. On site before, during and after these surveys, and in the latter case also drawing further insights from the desk-based analysis of the resultant digital models, was the structural analysis itself. Employing the project's standardized recording method, and informed by existing research on these complexes, this took place wherever possible in an integrated fashion alongside colleagues with a research track record at the sites concerned. Thus, for example, work in the S. Croce archaeological area (3) took place alongside an established team, led by Anna De Santis, which had already studied the complex array of buildings found there for over a decade. The overall work programme is also augmented by minimally intrusive testing of key structures. These tests largely focus on the characterisation of mortar, to allow further insight into the comparative dating of major public works. Thea Ravasi developed the Structural Analysis programme and coordinated the teams working across the project area. Results from the programme have allowed for the development of phased 3D models of each complex, and in the process have driven the reinterpretation of several sites, together with the generation of markedly more accurate plans and elevations than previously available. In some areas, most notably in the area (2) now occupied by the Azienda Ospedaliera San Giovanni -Addolorata, this work exposed fundamental errors in reports published by previous excavators. There it allows the formulation of new hypotheses on the incorporation of private properties in the imperial domain and on their transformations until the 4th century AD (Ravasi et al., 2020). Assisting the analytical process by generating digital clones of the archaeology repeatedly proved invaluable in understanding structural transformations, especially in underground spaces where a comprehensive viewing of coeval structures is often made impossible by later interventions. Furthermore, the resulting models will, we believe, open up all these areas to fresh approaches long after Rome Transformed has concluded. A concurrent programme of geophysical survey was undertaken deploying electrical resistance tomography and ground-penetrating radar, the latter variously deploying 70, 80, 200 and 400 MHz antenna, and on modern road surfaces a multi-frequency, multi-channel towed system. This programme, the largest single geophysical survey to be undertaken for archaeological purposes in Rome, was conducted by three teams, provided by the British School at Rome, the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) and Geostudi Astier. Where appropriate a mixture of geophysical methods was deployed over the same areas. Clearly the use of archaeological geophysics in urban areas presents multiple challenges. Of these, perhaps the most obvious is the depth of investigation. Radar signal attenuation is inevitably an issue, but the project attempts to mitigate this limitation by the comparative testing of innovative methods of data processing, with the use of multiple GPR antenna arrays, ERT, borehole survey, archival sources and observations from the structural analysis programme. Unmapped modern services and pipes (for example water, electricity, telecoms, sewerage, gas), access routes, and anomalies generated by traffic, bus routes and tramlines, the Metro, and urban furnishings, trees, and plant beds, must all be considered. Complicating matters include the implications of various weather conditions (though this of course applies to most geophysics surveys), gaining access to areas under diverse jurisdictions and owners, electromagnetic disturbance, and the passage of pedestrians and tourists. In addition to cartographic sources, the histories of individual properties require investigation, together with details of both published and unpublished excavations. Accordingly the archival analysis programme, led by Francesca Carboni (Carboni & D'ignazio, 2023), has drawn on resources from the Archivio Apostolico Vaticano/ Biblioteca Vaticana, the Biblioteca di Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte at Palazzo Venezia, the Archivio Storico Capitolino, the Archivio di Stato di Roma, the Archivio di Documentazione Archeologica at Palazzo Altemps, the Archivio Storico e Disegni of the Sovrintendenza Capitolina and the Archivio Centrale dello Stato. An imperative is to source data from ArcheoSITAR Project (https://www.archeositarproject.it/) and Forma Romae databases (http://www.formaromae.it/), and to ensure that project data can in turn be uploaded into these systems. The last main source of data is that derived from the project's borehole programme, targeted drilling at sixteen locations across the project area. Location is determined by the need to avoid unnecessary replication of work at areas where such data is already available (for example, that undertaken as part of the Metro C line works), but also by other factors. First, the need to avoid services of any sort, or to drill through highly sensitive areas. Second, selection of sites likely to have better organic preservation. The drilling campaign's main priority is to elucidate the natural topography of the project area, but reconstructing ground cover is of vital importance too. The final major consideration has been to see how data from the borehole campaigns can best enrich, and in turn be informed by, the results of the project's geophysical survey. Here the project draws on pioneering work undertaken at Portus, where the examination of cores alongside the reading of ERT profiles harvested at the same locations enhanced understanding of subsurface deposits (Kay et al., 2019). The cores are subjected to geological, micro-botanical and archaeological analysis, and samples submitted for radiocarbon dating. 3. The changing face of the eastern Caelian in the 1st-4th centuries AD Data capture is, of course, only the first part of the research process. Rome Transformed has developed a series of systems to enable the integration and synthesis of different data types. These systems consist of three main elements: RT 3D, RT SCIEDOC and the project's own 3D GIS. Given the, often dramatic, shifts in ancient and Late Antique land surfaces during the period under study, the project team identified the requirement for an enhanced system to model successive landscapes. Early indications were that at least six different Digital Surface Models (DSMs) needed to be generated if the physical transformation of the eastern Caelian was to be understood, and accordingly, a system had to be developed to deliver those models. The result is RT 3D, produced by a project team led by Margherita Azzari and Vincenzo Bologna (Bologna & Azzari, 2023). Working from a high-resolution DSM of the contemporary ground surface, the system draws upon an array of source material. Thus, existing geological maps, borehole data (both extracted by the project and from legacy sources), georeferenced historical cartographic data, geophysical data and the height point data recovered from the project's structural analysis programme can all be incorporated. In the latter case, there is a special emphasis on noting the level of ancient road surfaces, thresholds to exterior spaces and, in structures built into hill slopes, the height of windows. These data points then allow DSMs to be generated which can then be incorporated into the project's 3D GIS. Integral to the project's interdisciplinary approach to the built landscape is RT SCIEDOC (https://rometrans.ncl.ac.uk/rtsciedoc/). The exercise of developing such 3D models has multiple advantages over the long-established practice of generating 2D images. Perhaps the most obvious strength of the approach lies in the fact that it is harder to conceal unresolved aspects of the structural interpretation. While a single angle, or the artistic addition of figures and shadows may obscure important detail in a 2D image, digital models can be viewed from multiple angles and their basic structural integrity tested. But the advantages of such models go beyond this, for their production readily facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, as colleagues can connect and exchange information in visual form, something that allows greater precision than knowledge of one another's technical vocabularies may otherwise permit. Structural analysis of accessible fabric, archival images, and geophysics results can all feed into the model. In the latter instance the team seeks to progress what are variously termed three-tier visualisations, or full-data set models, based on an integration of geophysics anomaly interpretation with TLS/SFM-aided structural survey. The risks of misrepresentation inherent in visualising cultural heritage, were set out by those who framed the original London Charter (Anon, 2006)(Denard, 2012). Various responses have evolved, notably that developed by Marc Grellert and his colleagues at Darmstadt Technical University. Their system, SCIEDOC 'Scientific Documentation for Decisions' was conceived to make clear the source material that each stage of the generation of 'reconstruction' images (http://www.sciedoc.org/). With the generous collaboration of Dr Grellert, colleagues on the Rome Transformed team have developed their own variant, RT SCIEDOC (Haynes et al., 2023). RT SCIEDOC seeks to turn the risks of digital visualisation into assets, an approach that starts with the argument that such images should be regarded as arguments, or better still 'provocations'. Rather than suggesting that what is generated is in some sense a digital rebuilding of a past structure, the term provocation is used to solicit a constructive critical response from the viewer. Within the team, and it is hoped continually without, the generation of provocations is seen as essential to weighing evidence openly, justifying claims transparently, and equipping others to join in and develop the discussion more easily. Following a series of internal and open public sessions presenting provocations, the project team move on to completion of technical reports on individual structural reports and subsequently to the population of project's 3D GIS. Critical to the development of the project's GIS, and with a view to maximising its capacity to address key questions about the transformation of the Caelian, is ensuring that the underpinning system adopted is both capable of managing 3D shape files and yet accessible to as large a range of users as possible. This question of accessibility is, we would argue, too often lost in complex projects where the interrogation of spatial data ends up the province of only a small number of team members. Rather than developing a new system from scratch, it is important to employ one which a wide range of professionals within and beyond the project can use. Accordingly, therefore, the project makes use of ESRI ArcGIS Pro. It has, however, sought to innovate in its use of this package. Alex Turner, geomatician on the project, has emphasised the importance of relating good GIS use to good practice in metadata management (Turner, 2023). Metadata is recorded in an easily accessible format and linked to the visual spatial data generated by the project GIS. This ensures that it not only produces something with immediately tangible results, thus motivating team members to deliver on the otherwise unpopular task of detailed metadata management, but also makes a thorough ongoing exploration of data integrity much easier. Fuller discussion of the efficacy and implications of the harmonised use of these systems of data integration will follow, but key themes when attempting to appreciate the transformation of the southeast Caelian are emerging. Rome Transformed has as a stated aim to consider the role of the area in developing, illuminating, and in many cases promoting and projecting powerfully influential ideas about politics, security, and religion. While these can, and should, be explored in terms of specific architectural forms, the approach of the project is to go beyond this and to integrate architecture, with topography, in a dynamic environment. Our systems therefore aim to situate all these spaces and places within models of movement. Crucially all these themes can also be studied in 3D through simulating movement, the movement of people and animals, of water and of sound. The first theme of these is linked to access, not just in the sense of doorways and roadways, of paths and barriers, but also in terms of walls, heights and hills. A particular aspect here, sometimes archaeologically visible even when key sections of path or road cannot be readily recovered or observed, is the use of terracing. Also, relevant here is the occupation of space in a way that transforms access, such as the appropriation of areas for burials. Second in the discussion is water. Here again there is a need to go beyond the, undoubtedly important, matter of the course of major water supply infrastructure -aqueducts and sewers -and to look at water holistically. An approach truly informed by hydraulic engineering brings these macro systems, and the micro systems at the level of homes, baths and backyards, not only into contact with one another, but with the wider landscape. Flow modelling systems have a role to play here and adapted to the incomplete nature of the archaeological record, have the further benefit of enabling more refined hypotheses about the use of space than would be otherwise possible. Sound carries too, carrying with it signals about activity and the identity of different parts of the urban fabric. Accordingly, it warrants careful attention. Thus far most of the work undertaken by the project has involved the modelling of sound within buildings, but the project also sees the application of ODEON software for the interrogation of exterior spaces and streetscapes in this landscape of hills and valleys. The eastern Caelian was not a single administrative entity in antiquity. The hill was divided in two separate administrative regions by Augustus (regio II to the north and west and regio V, the Sessorian, to the East). It became part of the ecclesiastical regio II in the 4th century AD (Spera, 2013)). As noted above, the project seeks to focus in particular on a succession of key episodes in the physical transformation of the eastern Caelian. In broad terms, each episode is selected on the basis of developments which have profound implications both for the general character of the neighbourhood at their time, and for its capacity to illuminate through detailed analysis big themes in the political, military and religious life of the Roman world. The project's point of culmination comes with the transformations that marked the area in the late 8th and early 9th centuries AD, a time when new architectures not only articulated Leo III's synthesis of religious and secular rulership, but also -in the form of his development of the Lateran Palace -inspired the most powerful king of the era, Charlemagne, to emulate his achievement in the building of his own royal residence at Aachen. This paper will, however, focus on a narrower chronological range. It covers key transformations from the early imperial period through to the 5th century AD, focussing more specifically on the project's own archaeological and geographical contribution to our understanding of these changes. As mentioned, to assist the reader in navigating through the different parts of the eastern Caelian, each location in question will be referred to in relation to the project's area codes (as shown in Fig. 3.1). From at least the 4th century BC, elements of the eastern Caelian had been given over to cemeteries (Anon, n.d.)(Rocca et al., 1973)(Coates-Stephens et al., 2004). By the end of the 1st century BC, areas of high ground were marked by a striking density of burials. Close study of the tombs on the via Statilia (4), for example, shows how successive funerary monuments were squeezed into the spaces left between their predecessors, all projecting onto the so-called via Caelemontana. This is an area where radical changes in ground surface in antiquity is particularly marked, for not only does it account for the standard of preservation of the via Statilia group, but it is also vividly conveyed in the remodelling of the 1st-century AD columbarium of Tiberius Claudius Vitalis (Anon, n.d.), unearthed in the 1860s (Anon, 1866). The latter lies within the grounds of the Villa Wolkonsky, West of the via Statilia, but it clearly belongs to the same necropolis. Here successive phases of the tomb show how builders had to raise the entry of the building to keep pace with rising ground levels. Such indications are proving invaluable in developing RT3D-generated DSMs for the ancient landscape. Here we see too the importance of height, not just for the area itself, but for the entire city of Rome. Traces of a Republican underground aqueduct are visible within the excavations at the via Statilia, and these appear, for the short stretch that can be followed, to take much the same line as that subsequently traced by the Arcus Neroniani (Anon, n.d.). During the imperial period, the eastern Caelian was to emerge as a crucial point in the city's hydraulic system, ultimately seven out of Rome's eleven aqueducts passed through, converging at ad Spem Veterem, near the Porta Maggiore. For those with interests in the neighbourhood, this clearly had fundamental implications for the supply and development of an array of activity, but it is important to note that it was not the only way in which water shaped life here. In the lower-lying land immediately the south of the research area, water represented both an opportunity and a liability. The scale of the opportunity has been made most clear through the archaeological research that has accompanied Metro C works for San Giovanni station. Here the assiduous and sophisticated channelling of water from the Marrana was integral to the development of the horti. The advanced horticulture practiced here in the early 1st century AD, evidenced by the discovery of peach pits in the excavations, was enabled by careful hydraulic management (Rea, 2011)(Anon, n.d.). As noted below, however, later changes to the area, and in particular the construction of the Aurelian Wall, were to disrupt some of this management and, in time, to create their own problems. Certainly, the course of the waterlogged valley now concealed deep below the raised ground of the gardens on Via Carlo Felice ( 5), would have discouraged all but the most ambitious, and well-resourced building projects. The project team's own drilling in this area permits a still more nuanced picture of the range and evolution of this water course. It is within this undulating landscape that we must place the buildings that completed the horti, providing facilities for rest, relaxation and hospitality. Surviving traces of these buildings indicate, unsurprisingly perhaps, that high ground was particularly desirable, but more than that, that there was great investment in terracing the slopes. Here then were rooms with views, mere minutes from the forum complexes to the northwest, but with a prospect that looked to the south and east. This configuration is particularly noteworthy in the luxurious series of properties that lie today underneath the Lateran Basilica (1). Here, and in sharp contrast to the 3. The changing face of the eastern Caelian in the 1st-4th centuries AD later remodelling of this location for the Castra Nova (1), the buildings wrap around the slopes of the Caelian, permitting the occupants views out beyond the city to the delicately managed countryside beyond. That this was a significant and ongoing engineering effort is further evidenced by the addition of buttresses within one of the passages within the house here. The passage had been built up against the hillside, and this passage had been in use for some time before buttresses were added; sometime in the first half of the 2nd century AD the whole scheme was then overlain with painted wall plaster. When the passageways were first constructed is difficult to determine, but earlier excavations at the site yielded quantities of decontextualised wall plaster of a calibre and style that stands most direct comparison with imperial properties of Julio-Claudian date elsewhere (Anon, 1998). This observation, coupled with clear evidence that other walls within the complex were covered in marble up to a height of at least 5 m indicates very luxurious properties indeed, certainly consistent with the quality of imperial palace decoration. This need not indicate that the Lateran property was already part of the imperial patrimonium, as elite properties in Rome at this time could clearly be of the very highest quality, but the possibility should not be ruled out. A short distance from the Lateran Basilica, in the grounds of what is today the Azienda Ospedaliera San Giovanni -Addolorata (2), lie the remains of the Horti of Domitia Lucilla, an identification affirmed by stamped fistulae (Liverani, 2004)). This was the childhood home of the future emperor Marcus Aurelius. A far-reaching reappraisal of the original excavations of Santa Maria (Anon, 1995) has enabled the project team to reassess the structural sequence here, which stretches back well before the 2nd century AD. Appropriately, the picture here is of sophisticated terracing and of production: the project research led by Thea Ravasi suggests that a doliarium discovered here, which may have been part of the imperial property, remained in use into the 3rd century AD. The precise configuration of the building(s) that underlie what is today the Scala Santa complex (6) will likely never be known, but surviving evidence points strongly to the presence here of another lavish property. Here too terracing provided height and prospect to the house. Access to what would once have been south-facing rooms is possible in the crypt of the Oratorio dell'Arciconfraternita del Ss.mo Sacramento (Anon, n.d.), where alongside stretches of intact wall plaster, again from the first half of the 2nd century AD, still earlier architectural elements can be observed. Indeed, the team recorded the presence here of a Corinthian capital, dated on stylistic grounds to between the late 1st century BC and early 1st century AD. Ground-penetrating radar survey south of this area (Fig. 3.2), and immediately East of the façade of the Lateran Basilica, may indicate the presence of a further contemporary structure, but these results are still being reviewed in the light of new dating evidence, and core data. Turning now to the eastern extremities of the project area, it is difficult to characterise what is today the S. Croce archaeological area in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD (Anon, n.d.), but new evidence from this area, from both geophysical survey and structural analysis, indicates that the massive building programmes of the Severan period led to its wholesale redevelopment. The advantage of large, elevated surfaces, so obviously important in parts of the Caelian already, were to take on a new significance here at the turn of the 2nd-3rd century AD. Archaeologically, the changes associated with the Severans are very striking indeed. These are most notable in the area beneath the Lateran Basilica (1) (Anon, n.d.). Thanks to epigraphic evidence (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) we now know the period in which the Castra Nova, the New Fort of the equites singulares (the emperor's guard cavalry) was constructed. As its name suggests, the Castra Nova was not the first military foundation in the area, and indeed, Lanciani documented the discovery of great hall at nearby Via Tasso (Anon, n.d.), complete with multiple altars dedicated by equites singulares stationed at another base (CIL VI 31138-31187), the Castra Priora (Anon, n.d.) (Buzzetti, 1993). The current consensus dates the foundation of the Castra Priora to Trajan, but it remains uncertain exactly what area the fort itself occupied. Thus far, work by the project team has yet to identify compelling evidence for the precise location of the Priora, and a possibility remains that the fort itself lay further north than Lanciani's site. What we can reasonably say, though, is that the addition of the Castra Nova here substantially augmented a strong body of horseguards in the area. The implications of this for daily life in this part of the city, and for other imperial initiatives, warrant careful consideration. Both the date of the foundation of the Castra Nova, in operation by AD 197, and the location also speak to broader themes in the city of Rome and beyond. 3. The changing face of the eastern Caelian in the 1st-4th centuries AD First, Septimius Severus presented himself in his coinage as Restitutor Urbis (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.): as is increasingly evident, this was more than just rhetoric. Though one particular feature of Rome's urban pulse and dynamism was that successive emperors boasted of their own programmes to 'restore' the city, the scale of Severan work remains remarkably extensive (Anon, 2014). Reconstruction after substantial fire damage to Rome took place alongside the creation of an array of remarkable monuments. What gets lost in much of the discussion of this work, however, is the timeline. The Castra Nova was amongst the first construction projects and must accordingly reflect the emperor's priorities. The selection of the location of the Castra Nova (1), which was to have multiple consequences, also attests to certain priorities. At one level, it lay outside the pomerium, respectful in theory of long precedent, but at another, it was extremely close, mere minutes by horseback, from the Senate House and fora. But there is surely more to the location than that, for as our modelling of the setting indicates, standing on a purpose-built platform elevated above the higher slopes of the Caelian, the fort dominated the high ground and the approach of anyone entering Rome from the southeast. This is a textbook location for a Roman fort, recalling the tactical strictures in (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) on the positioning of campaign bases in hostile territory. When seen in the context of the ongoing use of the Castra Priora (Anon, n.d.), the likelihood that detachments of guardsmen were present elsewhere within the city (Coulston, 2000)(Anon, 2011), and imperial estates beyond, as at Ad duos lauros where many were buried in the via Labicana cemetery, the military aspect of this transformation is at once apparent. That the area repurposed at Albano to make way for the Castra Albana fortress of the Legio II Parthica at the same time was itself previously an imperial property makes this transition still more interesting. There is a further consideration here, water. Interestingly the Severan enhancement of the Claudio-Neronian aqueduct post-dates by a few years the construction of the Castra Nova. This might seem surprising, but in fact it is likely that the hydraulic system could already deliver the volumes of water required without augmentation. The restoration of the aqueduct must therefore be seen in a wider setting, both in terms of Rome's needs, and secondarily perhaps, as something that could then sustain the bath complexes restored or added to the eastern Caelian in the Severan period. Amongst these we must include reference to the building of the bath complex now under the Lateran Baptistery (1), an enterprise team members believe was completed in the reign of Caracalla, but which was ideally suited to serving the equites, and the addition of another separate one, a few metres away, but most likely for an entirely separate clientele. Further to the East, other substantial baths were added, notably the so-called 'Baths of Helena', were in operation from this time. Water was also integral to the military/security dynamic of the city. As noted above, seven of the eleven major aqueducts ran through the eastern Caelian. The capacity to cut the supply of water to large parts of Rome will have been apparent to the city's occupants. Indeed, in AD 238 precisely this strategy was deployed by the Praetorians (Anon, n.d.). Though the camp itself lay north of the eastern Caelian, its water supply originated here, at the Porta Maggiore (Anon, n.d.). Security and plentiful water are both essential assets for Imperial palaces. The development of the large imperial complex known as Horti Spei Veteris (SHA Heliogab. 13.5), much of which is now contained within the S. Croce archaeological area (3), must be understood in these contexts (Anon, 1955)(Colli, 1996)(Anon, 1998)(Anon, n.d.)(Borgia et al., 2008)(Bottiglieri et al., 2013). Our knowledge of the S. Croce complex has benefitted greatly from ongoing collaboration with the established team of researchers working there, and a fuller analysis will be published in due course. It is nevertheless important to note the following themes, all of profound relevance to the study of Roman cities. First, here, on the very outskirts of the city, there is clear evidence for another colossal programme of monumental construction, a programme that once again, as with the Lateran hill, only on a still greater scale, requires a radical elevation and levelling of the ground. Second, this initiative, the creation of what later becomes known as the Sessorian Palace (3), foreshadows an important trajectory in Roman urbanism. Looking particularly at later developments under the Tetrarchy, (Anon, n.d.) has noted the phenomenon of the palatial quarters (for example at Antioch, Thessaloniki, Trier) that are 'veritable \"new cities\" annexed to the older urban nuclei'. Many of these features (circus, reception halls, baths, and porticoes) appear in the Sessorian in the Severan period. The circus and main reception hall are quite connected, along with its associated and well-preserved amphitheatre, the Amphitheatrum Castrense, by a lavishly appointed porticus. This connectivity was assuredly part of the original design of early Severan date and represents, therefore, an interesting conceptual step to Dey's 'veritable new city' model, but it also clearly underwent significant change within a few decades. This is most evident in the Varian Circus, the largest monumental circus ever built in Rome. While the circus form was to endure for centuries at other sites around the Roman world, the Varian Circus had a life measured only in decades. Even before the Aurelian Wall cut across its circuit, other buildings had rendered the complex unsuited to chariot racing. A structural analysis team, led by Francesca Carboni from the Rome Transformed team with Laura Bottiglieri, has demonstrated that there was an intermediary structural phase, sandwiched between the construction of the circus and the building of the Wall. Lest we imagine that this means the impact of the Aurelian Wall on this southeast corner of ancient Rome was therefore somehow less important than it might otherwise appear, it is important to acknowledge that the balance of evidence rather points the other way. The Wall now embraced an area that had previously lain beyond the city's traditional boundaries. Access to some buildings, notably the Amphitheatrum Castrense (3), was transformed. While previously its arcades were open on all sides, the construction of the Wall led to their blocking, though the overall form and function of the amphitheatre endured. The same appears to apply to many of the buildings within the S. Croce archaeological area, and if anything, the sense of a 'new city' now walled 3. The changing face of the eastern Caelian in the 1st-4th centuries AD to the south and east, and indeed partially to the West, was only further enhanced. An intensification of occupation is suggested by the reuse of the passageways beneath the seating banks of the circus, now repurposed as part of a new structure within the palace complex. Further West, the construction of what becomes known as the 'Porta Asinaria' (1) provides a new monumentalised and fortified entry point to the city, albeit one still overlooked by the Castra Nova. As elsewhere on the Aurelian Wall circuit, the original height is approximately half that of what it later becomes when Honorius reworks the city's defences. Excavation work underneath the Asinaria, conducted by Lucos Cozza (Anon, n.d.), and further contextualised by survey and borehole drilling by the Rome Transformed team in association with Marianna Franco, demonstrates that the original ground surface and entry portal lay much lower than envisioned by earlier researchers, a realisation that further enhances our appreciation of the monumentality of the entryway from its earliest phase. This observation is of particular interest in the light of Ian Richmond's own observations. (Anon, n.d.), whose comment 'The world was not to know that its greatest City had become a fortified castle… The essential part of the plan was to build a wall which was strong, but inconspicuous', was perhaps partially influenced in this by his own study of the gate. Contributing to the ground-level changes here, as elsewhere on the southern edge of the research area, were flood deposits from the Marrana (Capelli, 2015)(Rea, 2016)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Structural analysis led by Francesca Carboni with Marianna Franco further East along the Wall (5) has (Anon, n.d.) showing views into the city looking northwest at the time of the construction of the Aurelian Wall in the AD 270s (Anon, n.d.). demonstrated that the waterlogged and thus unstable nature of the ground between the Porta Asinaria and the S. Croce archaeological area, meant that when Honorian works on the Wall took place, much of the curtain wall had to be replaced from the ground level up. Returning to the early 4th century AD, however, the next substantive transformation of the eastern Caelian came with Constantine. While the building work associated with this will have been spread over several years, it is not unreasonable to conclude that within days of his victory at Milvian Bridge on October 28, AD 312, Constantine's impact on the area was palpable. The destruction and/or dissolution of the equites singulares on that day meant that large areas previously under military occupation, would have become vacant. There is no surviving archaeological evidence for what happened to the base of the equites singulares of the Castra Priora (Anon, n.d.) at this time, but the Castra Nova (1) was demolished. As our modelling work makes evident, the Lateran Basilica, consecrated most probably in AD 318, was built over the central range of the fort, dwarfing what were once the largest and most magnificent buildings of the cavalry base. Builders were able to take advantage of the massive platform constructed for the fort, and by adding to it, ensured that the emperor's cathedral, seat of the Pope, towered over those entering the city from the south. A new religious foundation at the heart of Constantine's new model of rulership therefore obliterated, both literally and figuratively, a complex that formerly had exemplified the military strength and vulnerability of his predecessors (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Imagining the world's first cathedral was a major step with far more implications than the standard discussions of repurposing the remarkably adaptable basilica plan would suggest (Bosman et al., 2020). Its internal architecture, with its ceremonial 3. The changing face of the eastern Caelian in the 1st-4th centuries AD adaptations -a solea fencing the route from the entrance, through towards the apse, aligning most likely on the centre of the basilica's ornate fastigium and centre altarmarked a new synthesis of procession and audience with a new idea of the divine. Exciting new work by Gianluca Foschi is demonstrating the acoustic force of this architecture. As evolutions in liturgy informed architectural form, so the Lateran Basilica shaped and articulated new ideas about worship. Furthermore, it is also now possible to demonstrate conclusively, thanks to work by Elettra Santucci and Thea Ravasi, that the repurposing of other buildings previously associated with the Castra also served the new order. Thus, elements of the water supply system of the baths of the Castra were pressed into service for the new baptistery (1), itself an innovative architectural form which was to be widely emulated. In the direct context of the Lateran though, the location was assuredly partly selected to exploit purely local factors, namely the ready availability of good drainage close to the cathedral. Cathedral and baptistery forms were both to play an important role in Roman urbanism from the early 4th century AD onwards. Here in Rome, they served as the nexus of a growing array of religious buildings that were ultimately to manifest themselves in ideas of palatial architecture that would influence guest kings and inspire them in turn. The Lateran area was not, however, the only site in the research area where the long-term impact of the Severan transformation was to shape 4th-century AD topography. The Sessorian complex (3) endured and was embellished under the Constantinian dynasty, and the great hall at its centre retains its importance as the Basilica of S. Croce today. Existing features were similarly enhanced and transformed at this time, notably the elaborate bath complex, the Baths of Helena (Anon, n.d.), that lay nearby. The presence of baths such as these pose their own questions about the peculiar nature of urbanism in the southeast of the city: who did such extensive baths serve -staff from the Sessorian or a wider public? Further work may hope to resolve this question. In the following centuries, the Lateran Basilica and, to a lesser but still significant extent, the Basilica of S. Croce, were to remain key foci. Where there was ongoing monumental construction, it coalesced amongst the former. At the Lateran lay the home of the Bishop of Rome, but there were other high-status buildings too, the precise significance of which remains unclear. The remains of a substantial structure now located beneath the INPS building on Via dell'Amba Aradam (1) (Anon, 1991), has attracted widespread interest on account of its megalographic frescoes, interpreted by (Mcfadden, 2013) as a Constantinian image programme, must be understood in its topographical context (Liverani, 1993). Further work on the setting and architecture, now being undertaken by project team member Thea Ravasi in association with Simona Morretta (Soprintendenza Speciale Archeologia Belle Arti e Paesaggio di Roma), problematises previous interpretations, but also highlights the significance of the structure's setting. This needs to be seen, once more, within a context of hillside terracing on the extremities of the city. Here the elements of the building, notably the main corridor, are of Severan date; the celebrated frescoes added a century later. Houses of antiquity, such as the domus complex excavated beneath the Ospedale di S. Giovanni (2) at Corsia Mazzoni (Anon, n.d.)) and now substantially reinterpreted by the project team in work led by Thea Ravasi, remained in use into Late Antiquity and beyond (Plate 3.1). Evidence from the Ospedale's Corsia Folchi site, shows how even as the ground floor was raised, spaces were retained; what had been a heated apsidal room at ground level, was retained as an underground chamber. Some buildings were adapted to accommodate the needs of the Christian religious communities now drawn to the area. An important example of an early oratory, with frescoes dating to the second half of the 4th century AD, was also uncovered in the hospital's grounds, a mere 80 m West of the Corsia Mazzoni domus. It remains the focus of a major Italian-Japanese research project (Cerrito & Yamada, 2019). This intensity of ecclesiastical activity coalescing around a cathedral building was, as is well known, to be repeated at many major urban centres in the Roman world. The Lateran operated as a point of reference for those other centres in Italy and across much of the empire, not of course in a simple aping of form, but undoubtedly as exemplars for new uses of architecture and rite. That is, however, another story, and rather than plot its ongoing evolution here, we direct readers to further publications by the Rome Transformed team. 3. The changing face of the eastern Caelian in the 1st-4th centuries AD In addition to arguing that advances in digital technologies can facilitate step changes in how we visualise and debate the dynamics of Roman urbanism, we would suggest that the experience of Rome Transformed offers some other general lessons. At a generalised level, the ebb and flow of development in the eastern Caelian accords with the well-attested phenomenon of the 'fringe belt', a dynamic area as integral to the story of large cites as any of other aspect of the panoply of urban infrastructure (Anon, n.d.). The applicability of the 'fringe belt' concept to Rome more generally has already been explored by (Mandich, 2014)(Anon, n.d.). More specifically, though, we can see in this area the playing out of what are clearly key themes in evolution of the Roman empire's cities, notably in the nuanced adaptation of sophisticated engineering strategies, here deployed on monumental scale, to landscape transformation. Without its hydraulic engineers, without its terraces, without its concrete substructures, the city could never have undergone the pattern of transformation it did. This has multiple implications of course, and opens areas for new experimentation such as, for example, the palatial complex of the Sessorian, the design of which arguably pioneers its own model of urbanistic enclave. By the late 3rd century AD, the eastern Caelian has acquired -within wider Rome -what has become an essential urban characteristic, an enclosing wall, and, in the course of time, this is adapted to situate the pomp and procession of Late Antique ceremonial. The capacity of ecclesiastical centres to generate new forms of growth is also a dominant theme emulated across much of the empire, fostering a new kind of urban life, as the pulse of Classical cities weakened. There are also features that are more particular to Rome. As has been argued, the Severan transformation plays a key role in the longer-term evolution of the area, and while the fundamental role of the military in this may seem at a variance with general trends in Italian urbanism under the empire, it connected with currents elsewhere, notably urban development on the Danubian frontiers, and with the particularities of Rome itself. At one level, seen especially from the perspective of changes in land ownership, it can be seen as a successor to a process specific to the power play of the City of Rome's peripheries from the Principate onwards. The uniquely dynamic nature of Rome's horti is intimately linked to Roman power politics, as places where wealth might be displayed and influence pedalled. In such an environment, it is scarcely surprising that sometimes through inheritance, and sometimes through outright brutality, successive imperial proprietors and agents acquired steadily more land requiring, and facilitating, a new environment open to new forms of development. members of the Rome Transformed team for their contributions to the project's research. Rome Transformed receives funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 835271), the project team wishes to thank the following organisations and individuals without whom the work discussed here would have been impossible: Soprintendenza Speciale Archeologia Belle Arti e Paesaggio di Roma (especially Mirella Serlorenzi, Anna De Santis, and Simona Morretta), Sovrintendenza Capitolina ai Beni Culturali (especially Marianna Franco and Simonetta Serra), Musei Vaticani (especially Barbara Jatta, Giandomenico Spinola, Sabina Francini, and Leonardo Di Blasi), Azienda Ospedaliera San Giovanni -Addolorata (especially Maria Luisa Velardi, Francesco Pontoriero, Cinzia Martini), the British Ambassador to Italy and San Marino and the Embassy staff of Villa Wolkonsky (especially Allegra Serrao). Margherita Azzari, Vincenzo Bologna and colleagues (for RT3D), Gianfranco Morelli and colleagues from Geostudi Asiter for further GPR survey, Stefano Campana and Matteo Sordini of the University of Siena oversaw UAV SFM survey of the Aurelian Wall and Claudio-Neronian Aqueduct. The specialists working at S. Croce have generously collaborated with the Rome Transformed Team throughout work in their area. Roma Sotterranea provided expertise and safety cover (co-ordinated by Elettra Santucci). Luck is in the research method: Aquinum, the rediscovery of an 'invisible' town Excavations conducted since 2009 have contributed to our understanding of the Roman triumviral colony of Aquinum (Castrocielo, Frosinone -Lazio), making it one of the most important sites in the Italian archaeological panorama. The urban streets, the domus, theatre and monumental bathhouse complex, brought to light over the last thirteen years, have provided crucial data for understanding the entire ancient Roman town. This intense period of fieldwork activities has aroused the interest and curiosity of a wide public, while the discoveries have placed the ancient site into the national and international spotlight, defined by the media and social networks as a 'lucky' archaeological excavation. It must, however, be reiterated that behind these surprising and 'fortunate' discoveries lies careful and painstaking research work, carried out over the last 25 years, and developed as part of the 'Ager Aquinas Project'. This preface introduces the 'history' of topographical research at Aquinum which has been characterized by a multidisciplinary study, a well-established approach that has achieved remarkable results that will be discussed in this paper. The research activity, in which non-invasive remote sensing and ground-based survey activities have been fundamental, is helping to expand, modify and challenge our knowledge of this important urban site situated along the via Latina between Rome and Capua. The 'Ager Aquinas Project' forms part of the activities of the Laboratory of Ancient Topography and Photogrammetry (LabTAF) at the Department of Cultural Heritage of the University of Salento, Lecce. Research first began in 1998 with the purpose of developing, through a wide-ranging application, an operational model aimed at the identification of archaeological evidence in the area, its understanding, cataloguing and interpretation, within a Geographical Information System designed for the management and dissemination of data (Anon, n.d.)). 1 The project encompassed the territory that once belonged to the triumviral colony of Aquinum, in the middle 4. Luck is in the research method: Aquinum, the rediscovery of an 'invisible' town of the Liri Valley, at the centre of a vast plain dominated by the Monte Cairo massif to the north and the Aurunci mountain range to the south, on the western edge of three ancient lakes that have since disappeared. 2 The study was conducted using long experience accumulated in the field of Ancient Topography as well as making use of the latest methodologies and techniques. 3 Field and laboratory activities were carried out along the lines of inquiry that have always characterized the Lecce research group's topographical work: archaeological exploration of the territory by means of direct and systematic surveys, archaeologytargeted photogrammetry, use of specific applications for vertical and oblique aerial photography, low-altitude aerial surveys, applications linked to the use of different UAV sensors (RGB, thermal, multispectral, Lidar, and others), survey and analysis of monuments, geophysical prospections and setting up of a database linked to cartography and a Geographical Information System developed by the LabTAF (Anon, n.d.). Regular archaeological excavation campaigns have been underway since 2009, continuing the aforementioned research activities and aimed at verifying previous hypotheses. Trenches were opened in a central sector inside the urban area, within an area owned by the Municipality of Castrocielo. It is with this context that we would like to trace the history of research at Aquinum, a research characterized by a consolidated method, with field and laboratory activities featuring a multidisciplinary approach, focusing in particular on the integrated and systematic use of non-invasive remote-sensing and ground-based analyses. Despite some important topographical work carried out at different times in the last century by Cagiano de (Anon, n.d.) and (Giuliani, 1964), Aquinum lacked an adequate cartographic base for the drafting of a detailed archaeological map. All that existed of the Roman town were reconstructed plans of the settlement layout and the articulation of its internal street network, which made it possible to outline, albeit schematically, the main features of its urban topography. With a view to developing this line of research, without losing sight of the fundamental objectives to be achieved through the topographical study of the territory, this type of activity necessarily requires the use of well-established techniques of direct ground-based survey, both integral and systematic. New methods of recording -also cartographically -the presence and distribution of archaeological evidence were applied to the results acquired from field survey, taking into account absences and geographical-environmental factors that may have influenced, conditioned, limited or prevented field recording, showing the degree of legibility in 'visibility' maps of the 4. Luck is in the research method: Aquinum, the rediscovery of an 'invisible' town surveyed terrain. In addition, to facilitate field recording operations, a new software capable of supporting topographical survey -Project Ulixes -designed to run on compact systems (handheld PCs and PC tablets), is currently being implemented and tested. The system includes an internal module for the acquisition of Topographic Unit sheets that automatically associates the position of the find with its description (Giacomo & Scardozzi, 2008). As for the internal structure of the settlement of Aquinum, this has been reconstructed, using aerial photography and the few still-visible features on the ground, by (Giuliani, 1964), who identified the regular but not orthogonal pattern of the triumviral colony, with axes that did not intersect at right angles but gave rise to parallelogram-shaped insulae. LabTAF is one of the few existing operational centres in Italy for archaeological cartography. It was established to respond to the need for methodological criteria and the acquisition of modern technologies, to be applied in turn to the collection of data and the cataloguing of existing evidence in an area. The aim was to produce a cartographic base (drawn-up by archaeological operators), developed according to the highest current technological standards and which would constitute an ideal base for the drafting of Archaeological Maps. Since no adequate cartography existed for this type of activity, a specific numerical aerophotogrammetric restitution at a scale of 1:2000 of the urban and suburban area of the ancient town of Aquinum was produced at the LabTAF. The aerophotogrammetric restitution, supplemented by fieldwork, allowed questions to be posed and certain hypotheses to be formulated which, promptly verified on the ground, made it possible to trace the shape of the town, in particular the eastern sector, in greater detail. It was thus possible to reconstruct a much more extensive wall circuit, nearer the edge of the valley and better suited to meet the town's defensive needs. With this change, the settlement surface area now corresponds to approximately 100 ha, compared to the previously estimated 85 ha (Ceraudo, 1999). In addition to fieldwork, therefore, a great deal of attention was dedicated to the specialized analysis of vertical aerial photography, a fundamental tool for knowledge and documentation in studies of 'archaeological topography', which with its multiple applications represents one of the sources that has provided the most useful results for studies in the field. All the evidence duly acquired offered new insights into the study and understanding of the urban layout, allowing the revision and modification, not so much in form as in substance, in what must have been Aquinum's urban plan. As is now well known, the Roman town was characterized (1) by the route of the via Latina (which crossed it in an east-west direction, dividing it into two parts), (2) by its imposing defensive system (consisting of an enclosure wall and, on three sides, a large ditch), (3) by the regular but non-orthogonal arrangement of the axes of the road network (whose unusual layout -east-west the decumanus, northwest-southeast the cardo -gave rise to parallelogram-shaped insula blocks), and (4) by the presence, at various points within the settlement, of monumental remains of a number of ancient buildings. 4 The latter, once surveyed and reported in a specially developed numerical aerophotogrammetric map, made it possible to clarify and redraw certain aspects of the forma urbis of Aquinum (Ceraudo, 1999). With regard to this aspect in particular, which allowed for prediction of the presence of infrastructure and the typology of structures in the ancient urban area, work was based on the first reconstruction of the insulae proposed by (Giuliani, 1964), thanks to the photointerpretation of aerial images taken in 1944 by the Royal Air Force and published in a fundamental article, although the absence of photogrammetric requirements in the photos made it impossible to define the exact size of the blocks. Only more recently was it possible to ascertain, by means of a detailed survey, the exact size of the largest insulae, with a module of 212 × 140 metres (6 × 4 actus). 5 Furthermore, it was possible to note an additional internal division with the height of the blocks corresponding to 70 m (2 actus). This reconstruction is based on the presence, in addition to the decumanus maximus formed by the via Latina, of a total of 14 decumani: 7 to the north of this and 6 to the south (Fig. 4.2). The plan shows a change from the fourth decumanus to the north, up to the line of the walls, where the last two blocks appear longer. These insulae, probably constrained by the presence of a large temple, the so-called Capitolium (Anon, n.d.), measure 4.5 actus, and are in turn divided in half (270 feet, about 80 metres) (Anon, n.d.). More articulated, and therefore more complex, is the attempt to reconstruct the width of the insulae, given the dislocation (not always constant), discontinuity and fragmentary nature of the cardines identified so far. Only five, in fact, have been recognized with certainty, almost all based on the continuation of modern roads and field boundaries that roughly follow the ancient route: the cardo maximus, the so-called 'via Montana', which basically follows the via Civita Vetere in the northern part and via Saudoni (from San Pietro Vetere) in the southern; the eastern cardo, identified thanks to the preservation of via Campo Spinello, and the western cardo, reconstructed thanks to the features visible in aerial images and located in a field to the east of the so-called Capitolium (Anon, n.d.). All these elements seem to confirm a constant width of 6 actus for the insulae adjacent to the cardo maximus. There are, however, some irregularities in this reconstruction, which do not always seem to fit into this module even though they follow the actus as the basic unit of measurement. These are recognizable in the line of walls on the western side, on which via Santa Maria Maddalena runs, in some cadastral parcels oriented according to the cardines and in 'via della Palestra', the only ancient road with a northwest-southeast orientation excavated so far, brought to light beneath the Casale Pascale in correspondence with the main entrance on the southern side of the palaestra of the 'Veccian baths'. All these data seem to suggest a much more complex layout than the one hypothesised, which only the continuation of research activities will be able to clarify. Research activities tied in to remote sensing were not limited to the acquisition of vertical aerial photos and the production of specific cartography. Agreements with bodies or institutions qualified to fly, such as the Nucleo Tutela del Patrimonio dei Carabinieri, the Corpo Forestale dello Stato and the Nucleo Elicotteristi dei Vigili del Fuoco di Roma, made it possible to monitor and document the entire area under investigation via targeted flights. Starting in 2005, a specific aerial reconnaissance program of the area was initiated, with low-altitude photographic surveys and oblique aerial shots along the entire valley. Some of the numerous aerial images available have shed light on a central sector of the urban area just northeast of the theatre, which previously had not yielded any evidence useful for defining the layout of the urban structure (Fig. 4.3). The favourable combination of the agricultural work carried out in the fields and the choice of an optimal period for the identification of features allowed for the discovery of an extensive sector of the settlement. Prior to the flights, thanks to field survey, areas with considerably higher concentrations of ancient material had been identified. As a result of the aerial photographs, it was possible to see how these concentrations were related to the remains of isolated buildings aligned along the urban road axes and clearly visible the recently acquired aerial images. It is therefore possible to reconstruct, within a sector that seems to have been intended for residential structures, the presence of several large complexes, certainly domus, with large unbuilt spaces left within the insulae. This situation is distinct from that identified in the southern part of the settlement to the east of the amphitheatre, where it was possible to recognize, before the area was cleared by excavation work carried out inside an equestrian centre, several insulae with a greater concentration and articulation of buildings, including perhaps a bath complex (Anon, n.d.). Research activities at Aquinum have undergone a continuous evolution over the years, in line with the tradition and methodology of the aforementioned aerial survey but renewed through the use of new and more up-to-date technologies. Recently, in fact, a considerable amount of data deriving from the study of traditional aerial photographs (historical and recent, vertical and oblique) has been integrated through aerial recording by way of remotely piloted aircraft, namely drones. The UAV sector is currently going through a period of considerable development with increasingly sophisticated vehicles and technologies which, thanks to their practicality and costeffectiveness, guarantee a wide range of uses in the field of archaeology. From the first interventions, more oriented towards addressing simple documentation, their deployment has moved on to meet the demands of multiple fields of application such as, for example, the aerophotogrammetric survey and topography of archaeological areas, surveys of monuments and excavations as well as the mapping and monitoring of vast areas of the landscape. A flexible tool that lends itself to a wide range of uses for the documentation, conservation, prevention and management of archaeological and landscape heritage. The most interesting aspect, however, not yet fully grasped, is the enormous potential of these tools for acquiring a more in-depth knowledge of the territory. Beyond the understandable advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, repeatability and autonomy of operations, the use of drone remote sensing has constituted a formidable research opportunity for Aquinum, with the possibility of constantly monitoring vast portions of the ancient settlement, strategic areas as well as areas of specific interest (Ferrari et al., 2015). 6 Our aim was to acquire data through the recording of new archaeological marks, taking advantage of the possibility of replicating flights at different times of the year, as the fields are worked seasonally, or even at different times of the day, as the terrain is better exposed according to the different inclination of the rays of the sun. 7 The remains of ruined monuments are still visible in various parts of the settlement (Anon, n.d.), for which a specific program of survey and analysis was initiated, followed by a detailed study for an accurate reconstruction, implemented with the use of 3D models. This made it possible to highlight the structural and architectonic peculiarities of the buildings and their construction techniques, also in relation to the period to which they belonged. In the western sector these are: the remains of the amphitheatre, the Porta Romana, a tower just to the north, and the temple building known as Capitolium. In the eastern sector, we have the honorary arch known as 'Arco di Marcantonio', the Porta San Lorenzo, and the long wall to the south of the latter. Lastly, in the central sector, are the theatre and building with an apse. Crucial was the involvement of young researchers specialized in the field, who collaborated with great commitment in these phases of research. 8 4. Luck is in the research method: Aquinum, the rediscovery of an 'invisible' town Significant results relate in particular to the two large buildings used for spectacles: the theatre and amphitheatre, which fit perfectly into the urban grid, even though they are not chronologically coeval. 9 All that is still visible of the theatre today are the remains of the load-bearing part of the cavea, parts of the 22 radial walls (1.05 m wide and preserved for a maximum length of 16.5 metres), the inner nucleus in opus caementicium, covered externally by slightly irregular opus reticulatum facing. The side of the quadrangular cubilia, made of local travertine, indeed vary between 10 and 14 cm. These curtain walls constituted the supports of the concrete barrel vaults, some of which are still partially preserved, providing in all probability the necessary support for the overlying tiers of seats in the media cavea, inclined at an angle of approximately 27° (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). 10 At present, no elements related to the scaena, which must have originally occupied an area about 15 m wide running between the still-preserved supports and the northern edge of the via Latina (Anon, n.d.), are visible. In the absence of reliable excavation data, the chronology of the building -on the basis of the construction technique alone -can be set between the establishment of the municipium (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), dating both spectacle buildings to the 'Municipal period'), the dedication of the triumviral colony (Anon, n.d.), the 1st century BC (the most likely hypothesis), the Augustan period (Anon, n.d.) or, more generally, the early Imperial period (Cagiano de (Anon, n.d.). The amphitheatre was located in the southwestern sector of the town against the walls, intra moenia but in a decentralized position, as was usually preferred for buildings of this type. It stood on the site where Casale Bonanni, which, trapezoidal in shape, was built at the end of the 18th century (recently demolished along with large portions of the Roman building) incorporating four of the radial septa of the cavea. Although the monument was severely damaged by the construction of the Autostrada del Sole (the A1 motorway) which obliterated about a third of it, thanks to the survey of the surviving parts prior to their demolition it was possible to reconstruct the general plan and size (58 × 35 m) of the arena. 11 A number of the structure's radial supports, built in opus reticulatum with tufa block facings, were incorporated in the external structure of the farmstead and its cellars. On the other hand, short sections of wall in mixed technique (opus reticulatum and opus latericium) of the annular corridors of the arena are still visible along the northern shoulder of the motorway. Also in this case, due to the lack of excavation data and on the basis of the construction technique alone, the chronology of the building -surely established after the dedication of the triumviral colony -cannot be related to that of the theatre but must be attributed to the early Imperial period. 12 Once documented in detail, the remains of the ancient features were positioned inside the developed numerical aerophotogrammetric map, allowing us to highlight and redraw, in combination with data garnered from archaeological photointerpretation, hitherto unknown aspects of the form and urban layout of Aquinum, paying special attention to its positioning within the urban grid. The need to experiment with innovative tools and new survey methodologies stems from the long experience acquired with the previously illustrated methods, the awareness of their intrinsic limitations and the observation of a progressive erosion of surface evidence. For this reason, a series of geophysical prospection campaigns were launched with the aim of testing the potential of this type of investigation, integrating and cross-referencing it with the data already available. The prospection works carried out so far have covered a total surface area of 15 ha with magnetometry and c. 10 ha with georadar, conducted in areas rich in archaeological material and features, and where field surveys had already been carried out. 13 Once again, results have been exceptional, fully confirming the data obtained from the survey and archaeological photo-interpretation work, highlighting more clearly the location of the buried structures (Fig. 4.5). With the start of regular excavation campaigns in 2009, an attempt was made to provide an initial answer to aspects related to the road network. The first two test trenches were, in fact, opened in correspondence with the two decumani rebuilt north of the via Latina but not detected as features in the aerial photos, in order to understand the reasons why the traces, clearly visible in the neighbouring fields, were absent in the targeted area. At the end of the first campaign, the discovery of two finely paved streets with white limestone blocks in the locations already suggested has allowed us to show with certainty the validity of the hypothesised insula module and realize that all traces of the road axes identified so far in the aerial images referred with absolute certainty only to portions of viae glareatae. The paved streets, on the other hand, were not clearly visible in the traces and could only be detected in a few cases, especially thanks to the geophysical prospections conducted in various sectors of the town (Anon, 2010)(Piro et al., 2011). In the insula brought to light between the two road axes, conventionally identified as 'Via del Teatro' and 'Via delle Terme', the excavations uncovered an enormous public bathhouse complex: the Central Baths or Balneum of M. Veccius, named after the magistrate who founded them (Ceraudo et al., 2019). Consistent with the urban road system of Aquinum (Ceraudo, 1999)), the structures are arranged according to a double east-west and northwest-southeast orientation. In addition to the bathhouse building, now almost entirely excavated (Anon, n.d.), it was also possible to investigate around and near other monuments that are still visible but that have seen only limited study. Recent test trenches opened in the area of the theatre documented the presence of part of the stone elements of the annular corridor and the external pillars, already hypothesized in an earlier three-dimensional reconstruction of the monument (Ferrari, 2007). On the other hand, work carried out near the so-called Temple of Diana, an imposing apsidal building oriented according to the urban cardines, confirmed the presence of two fundamental road axes already theorized in the reconstruction of the road The complexity of the strategy adopted and the substantial volume of data acquired made it essential to create a GIS system for the storage, management and processing of the data collected up to this point, a logical consequence of the territorial research, finalized cartography and photo-interpretation. The LabTAF Geographic Information System was created by bringing together the experiences and technologies developed over a decade of applications through successive refinements in a number of sample territories representative of the national panorama (Guaitoli, 2001)). The GIS is based on a general cartographic reference framework and various datasets specifically structured for the various areas of research (urban centres, territory, monuments, excavation finds, museum materials, and others). All the archaeological elements are included in a numerical cartography and associated to a database developed according to the knowledge of the individual territorial assets. This contains the information on all the various elements existing on the ground, indicating their condition, damage, risk, cadastral data and type of documentation (historical, geographical, photographic and cartographic). 4. Luck is in the research method: Aquinum, the rediscovery of an 'invisible' town Like all GIS systems, the structure allows spatial, geographic and alphanumeric queries integrated in several directions and with great operational power. As previously stated, most of the data was obtained through systematic survey and analytical filing, including information already known from historical-bibliographical research, perusal of archival sources, analysis of aerial photographs and various types of aerial images, including satellite images, with the primary purpose of knowledge, conservation and valorisation of the cultural heritage as a strategic resource for the growth of the territory. This line of research is not only aimed at the historicalarchaeological reconstruction of the landscape, but also at the renewal of the protection system as part of an overall valorisation strategy. The planned work program for Aquinum was tailored to the enormous archaeological potential and research perspectives offered by the site. A key aspect of the project was the primary need for knowledge and management of the area, subjected to a gradual but constant destruction caused by agricultural work and, in some areas, deep and extensive ploughing. The planning and exploratory work carried out over the last few years has also taken into account the results of data processing and documentation relating to systematic field surveys, aerial reconnaissance and geophysical prospections carried out in more than a decade of research activities by the University of Salento (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2010). The current state of knowledge, the consistency of the archaeological deposits, the abundance of materials and the considerable traces revealed during the aerotopographical investigations, all constitute univocal indicators of favourable conditions for the planning of future survey projects aimed at ascertaining and verifying what has been identified through the aforementioned scientific research activities. Fundamental results have thus been achieved within the general framework for the reconstruction of the urban layout of the ancient town and, in particular, through the excavation of a central sector of the settlement, characterized by public buildings, some of which were already known (the theatre and apsidal building) and others newly acquired to the archaeological patrimony (the public baths). All this, it is hoped, will serve as a driving force for a better management of the site, also in view of a future strategic valorisation of the area. 1. The project, aimed at the study of the Roman town and its territory, is part of the research programs of the LabTAF, launched in agreement with the Superintendence of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape for the provinces of Frosinone and Latina, with the support of the Municipality of Castrocielo. 2. In anticipation of the final publication of the Archaeological Map of Aquinum, which is currently at an advanced stage, some of the most interesting results of the research work carried out at the site have been presented in (Ceraudo, 1999)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Ceraudo, 2004)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Basso & Dobreva, 2020)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Ceraudo et al., 2017)(Anon, 2018)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2002)(Gigli et al., 2004)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). On the via Latina in the territory of Aquinum: Ceraudo 2023. As for the wall enclosure, its eastern side was naturally defended by the presence of three lakes, as testified by (Anon, n.d.), drained and reclaimed towards the end of the 16th c. by Giacomo Boncompagni (Duke of Sora from 1579 to 1612) following the purchase of the fiefs of Aquino from the d'Avalos family in 1583 (Coldagelli, 1969). This would seem to be confirmed by a wall-painting in the Salone dei 18 Paesi ('Hall of 18 Countries') in the Boncompagni-Viscogliosi Castle on the Island of Liri, which depicts Aquino and its territory towards the end of the 16th c. with the lakes already drained. 5. Thus correcting the measurments proposed by (Anon, n.d.). The module that has been reconstructed is that of the programmatic plan which, within the urban space, does not always coincide with the measurements of the actual plan. The alignments of the ideal mesh did not always fall in the same point, but could vary, coinciding with different elements such as the centreline of the roadway, one of its two sides or even with the front of the insula. 6. We employed multi-rotor and fixed-wing UAVs, cross-referencing data with geophysical surveys and experimenting with new aero-photo image processing techniques. 7. Scheduling the flight and acquiring aerial images requires very little time (compared, for example, to using an aircraft), making it possible to achieve adequate photogrammetric coverage of areas of several hectares in just a few minutes. Its simplicity allows to carry out numerous flights, verify data onsite and, if necessary, repeat shots in order to obtain the best results. The possibility of repeating flights is essential to ensure a more complete coverage of the archaeological context with numerous high-quality images in different conditions and with different exposures, in search of the best possible conditions. 8. e.g. (Murro, 2007) on the 'Capitolium', the honorary arch and Porta San Lorenzo; (Ferrari, 2007) for the theatre and amphitheatre. 9. The specific building technique adopted for the theatre is completely different from that of the amphitheatre (an aspect never properly emphasised) and implies that the dating of the two monuments -set at different times during the 1st c. BC, or the early 1st c. AD -should, in my opinion, be revised (Anon, n.d.)). 10. Parts of the barrel vaults are preserved between row 19, 20 and 21, counting from the first row to the east. 11. The arena measured 58 x 35 m; see (Ferrari, 2007)(Anon, n.d.) proposed a Julio-Claudian date on the basis of the available published evidence. 13. Magnetometric prospections (with a gradiometric magnetometer, an Overhouser GSM-19GW by Gemsystem) were conducted in collaboration with colleagues from the Laboratory of Landscape Archaeology of the University of Siena under the direction of Stefano Campana. The most recent ground-penetrating radar (GPR) prospections were instead carried out in collaboration with Frank Vermeulen and Lieven Verdonck from the Department of Archaeology of Ghent University (the GPR network, towed by an all-terrain vehicle, comprises 15 500MHz antennae, a frequency which has previously proved effective for the prospection of other Roman urban sites).

Granted, the extraordinary scholarly output of the site hardly matches the modest remains on the Ansedonia promontory. To the visitor, Cosa may be a disappointment, if not a downright projection of the vision of Frank Brown, the first archaeologist to shed light on the colony and its material record. Today, the presentation of Cosa and its monuments is vastly obscured by the macchia, while the current archaeological itinerary reflects Brown's tenet that Cosa was a miniature copy of Rome, projecting, as it were, an idea of urbanism and monumentality that was expected to mirror the realities of the capital in the 3rd century BC (Fig. 5.1). Much research has debunked this myth and altogether positioned Cosa in the context of Roman expansion, and, more fundamentally, in the narrative of southern Tuscan cities whose settlement lingered for centuries. What is more, the discourse of Roman colonization has decisively parted company with frameworks taken up by (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Erdkamp, 2011)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2015)(Coles, 2017). Extensive though Cosa's archaeological record may seem, it primarily illustrates the floruit of the colony during the 2nd century BC and the Augustan period. Accordingly, this same perspective permeates most of Cosa's scholarly output, with the discussion of the material record typically couched in narratives of foundation, floruit, and decline. The critique of Cosa's scholarly tradition, however, does not concern us here. Rather, it needs to be stressed that the early days of the colony and, in turn, the post classical phases of the town, still offer plenty of room for discussion. While the former is being taken up by new research (Giorgi et al., 2023)), questions about the incubation of the Roman settlement, and the political climate that brought to bear the establishment, remain paramount. In that vein, this essay formulates new questions about old problems, highlighting the colony of Cosa and its unique relationship with the territory, a dynamic connection that veers from the tropes of centuriation, iugera distribution, and civic allotments. In particular, this study takes up Cosa's genealogy and growth, vis à vis the cultural and environmental realities of Cosa's settlement in its formative years. How the colony nucleated and negotiated its layout and urban plan, perhaps falling short of meeting the long-term expectations of its stakeholders, yet showcasing a remarkable degree of resilience, is the main thrust of this research. To that end, this essay probes the Tyrrhenian seaboard of Cosa and brings into sharper focus discrete areas of the ancient town: the axes near the forum, the horreum, a sector of the town now tentatively defined as the macellum and the Portus Cosanus, that is Cosa's anchorage. What is more, the corollary of water management and delivery offers a lens to discuss the nucleation and growth of this community and, last but not not least, their sense of belonging and knowledge of the place. Perched on a karstic promontory overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea and measuring approximately 13 ha, the town commanded a vast territory of 550 km 2 , extending from the mouth of the Albegna River all the way to Vulci and plausibly, the Marta River (Fig. 5.2). Much of this very fertile land was to be occupied by the early colonists, at least in the expectations of the agency behind the project, whatever that might be. The core of the district was the triangle today referred to as 'Valle d'Oro' which included the site of Settefinestre and where traces of centuriation also survive (Castagnoli, 1956)(Dyson, 1978)(Rathbone, 1981)(Carlsen, 1984)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In geological terms, the site of Cosa is nested on top of a dolomitic rock promontory, 114 m a.s.l. The compact limestone has been susceptible to the formation of sink holes, with at least one such feature north of the forum and a series of fissures in the port area. As with the climate, rain here is scarce, 460 mm a year, some of the lowest figures in Tuscany. Earthquakes, too, may have taken a toll on the built environment of the town with episodes in AD 408 and 618 (Anon, 1989); the collapse of the vaulting of one of the baths, in particular, offers compelling evidence of the violent, instantaneous destruction of a sector of the building. More fundamentally though, Cosa does not have water resources. The promontory is bereft of any source of perennial water and not conducive to the construction of aqueducts. These limitations, however, never hindered or brought to a halt a long and complicated history of settlement. And it should be borne in mind that east of the promontory, where the Portus Cosanus grew in synchrony with the colony, is a strip of prehistoric marshes and lagoons that extended for several kilometers. (Anon, 1961) were the first to address the role of this ecosystem as it impacted human settlement. They noted that the strip of marshes east of the Ansedonia promontory was a fundamental corollary to settlement in the region, as it offered key sources of sustenance, other than an ideal setting for the development of fisheries after the foundation of Cosa. Our programme of coring, undertaken with Jean Philippe Goiran at the University of Lyon near the area that was occupied by Cosa's small port, has aimed at producing a sedimentary history of the Ansedonia promontory and adjacent harbour. So far, this research has demonstrated that this paleoenvironment intersected with human agency as early as the early 1st millennium BC. This signature of early anthropic intervention in one of our cores does not, of course, offer a fixed benchmark, and firm material evidence is in short supply. Nevertheless, the data informs us about the early interaction between human agency and the environment at an early stage, long before the establishment of the Latin colony in 273 BC. Moreover, Iron Age settlements on the Feniglia sandbar as well as the floruit of the Orbetello settlement in the 7th-6th centuries BC (Calastri 2019), offer tantalizing evidence for the uptick of settlement in this district starting in the 1st millennium BCE. Located 6 km northwest of Cosa, Orbetello owes its renown to the lagoon and wetland adjacent to it. Two sandbars, the Tombolo della Giannella and Tombolo della Feniglia separate the lagoon from the Tyrrhenian Sea. In the centre of the lagoon is Orbetello, lying on a sandbar now connecting the mainland to Mt. Argentario by a causeway. Orbetello is notoriously girded by a system of polygonal fortifications that stylistically duplicated that of the Latin colony of Cosa. Previously though, it may have initially served as epineion of Cosa, that is a military port (Anon, 2019)). Yet Orbetello and its obscure history of settlement, in particular, remain a cultural facet that has not been sufficiently explored, for all the implications that this harbour community may have had with the foundation and development of the colony of Cosa. As the Etruscan and Punic threats were looming in the region, the Roman presence near the Orbetello peninsula and the Tuscan archipelago, was driven by the necessity to secure northbound maritime traffic (Anon, n.d.). The position of colonial settlements in this districts would have thus cemented a sense of Roman presence over the corridor that included the islands of Giglio (Igilium) and Giannutri (Dianium), all the more as the role of the port of Talamone (Portus Telamonis) seemingly dwindled down in the early decades of the 3rd century. 1 The addition of a docking facility for military ships at Portus Herculis on the Argentario peninsula in the last decades of the 3rd century BC casts further light onto this flurry of building initiatives, while also illustrating a picture of increasing volume of navigation and related infrastructure. 2 Ad hoc adjustments and the appearance of new local interlocutors seem to have been the pattern as Roman presence was setting its foothold on a region, that of the Tuscan seaboard, that regulated traffic to the archipelago and, beyond, Sardinia as well as Liguria. We shall return to Orbetello and its role below; for now, it needs to be stressed that this local perspective helps shed further light on the occupation of the Ansedonia hill and the foundation of the colony of Cosa. Simply put, a local angle of opportunism and possibilities, wedded, however, with the political realities of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, unpacks new scenarios above and beyond the realities of foundation and conquest. For starters, one may consider the environmental corollary. Heavy-handed human intervention appears to be the signature for the region during the 3rd century BC. In particular, a host of proxies suggest trends of interest that began long before the deductio of colonies in the region. The last three millennia of the c. 15,000-year pollen record from Lago di Mezzano, some 50 km west of Cosa, illustrate the effects of human impact, and, not least, deforestation, with values steadily increasing between 700 BC and the 1st century AD, when there is also a significant presence of avena/triticum, along with herbs linked to human disturbance (Sadori, 2018). This information also seems to dovetail with other paleobotanical datasets, not least from the Lago di Accesa, Poggio San Martino, and Poggio dell'Amore: they signal the gradual reconfiguration of the vegetation canopy in the greater Tuscan region, with trends of wholesale replacement of select taxa, and heavy exploitation of quercus (Rattighieri et al., 2013). It is safe to infer that said trends began in the Etruscan period and gained traction at the time of the Roman conquest. We should posit a similar environmental impact on the Ansedonia hilltop, when around 273 BC the Latin colony was established. While the deforestation of the promontory cannot be documented, ubiquitous scarping and levelling of limestone outcrops for quarrying purposes attests to the forethought and labour that accompanied the early days of the colony and the wholesale reconfiguration of the hilltop of Ansedonia. More to the point, the foundation of the colony was powerfully demarcated by its perimeter of polygonal walls, still in great condition. The circuit ran for about 1.5 km in length with 21 towers, and an interior line surrounding the Arx of slightly less than 200 m (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Towers were projecting rectangles, with the exception of one of circular form (possibly of the Augustan period), and concentrated on the sea sides of the fortification, designed as they were against threats from the sea, plausibly pirates or Carthaginians (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The scale of the project is the crux of the problem: was there a need for a so potent and conspicuous ring of walls? Was this a clear statement of conquest, or rather the by-product of current anxieties, with possible pockets of Etruscan resistance and a looming threat moving from Carthage? All the same, the planning and execution of the monument are nothing short of remarkable. Our ongoing study of the colony's energetics shows that expediency in the execution and local quarrying were key to this project (Barker et al. forthcoming). Calculating the project's labour time, we suggest that approximately 80 days of labour may have sufficed for the completion of the project, by the hands of 2,500 presumed families of settlers. Of course, the demographics of colonial enterprises in the 3rd century BC are a matter of dispute, and those of Cosa are no exception. For too long, studies have suggested tallies grounded in 258 alleged living structures (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Fentress & Perkins, 2016); this projection is no longer tenable, as shown by the recent GPR analysis of the site, which shows vast sectors of the town devoid of any building activity (Anon, n.d.)(Scott et al., 2021). Rather, the nature and scale of the early construction projects at Cosa help us assess the original investment and, not least, the size of the community. Based on contemporary similar enterprises at Cales and Luceria, one can argue that the initial number of colonists should not have exceeded those figures. All the same, going back to the construction of the walls and labour involved, it is apt to say that the homogeneity of the project and its solid character make it plain that forethought, design, and architectural know-how effectively coalesced in a project that was designed to attract new constituencies and investments, but still fundamentally tied to the territory. Lastly, it needs to be stressed that a synchronic project of defences was implemented at Orbetello (Calastri 2019): this perimeter of defences presumably superseded fortifications that girded the 7th-century BC settlement and encircled the promontory with their 1,926 m long circuit. While the masonry of the walls of Cosa was mimicked in the following years by projects like the Villa delle Torrette in the Valle d'Oro, Orbetello was no mere imitation (Dyson, 1978). The masonry style (Lugli III/IV) and the execution make it plain that this project was germane to that of Cosa, probably executed by the same hands. As a flurry of building initiatives were unfolding on the Ansedonia hilltop site, much was also happening in the vicinity of Cosa's anchorage, the site typically referred to as Portus Cosanus, an anchorage that has been brought into sharper focus by the study of Ann Marguerite McCann, and later Giulio Ciampoltrini (Giorgi, 2022). The configuration of the port is well known, from the breakwaters to the imposing silhouette of a temple dedicated to an unknown deity and destroyed by modern development. 3 Nevertheless, for too long its establishment synchronic with that of the colony has been sidelined, while its relevance has been pigeonholed into the commercial fortunes of the elites of the region, not least the Sestii family during the last decades of the 2nd and the 1st century BC (out of a vast bibliography, see (Rathbone, 1981)(Anon, n.d.). Instead, the archaeological record of the site bespeaks a project that brought to bear the stamina and forethought of the Cosa planners. In particular, the polygonal masonry lining up the structure on its north side betrays a project that was in harmony with the 3rd-century BC fortifications on the hilltop (Anon, 1987)). 4 Furthermore, its topography makes it plain that two axes of traffic from the northeast and southeast gates were designed to reach Cosa's forum and its adjacent commercial areas (Fig. 5.3). Wheel ruts along the 'Road of Porta Romana' document the flow of goods in and out of the town, while the archaeological collections of the port suggest that alleged recession that unfolded on the hilltop of Cosa needs to be reconsidered (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). More importantly though, the Portus Cosanus was the locus where less visible, yet equally paramount, modifications took place. Behind the harbour and its infrastructure of backwaters and piers was an intricate system of southwest-northeast water canals, consisting of two natural clefts in the dolomitic rock of the promontory and one man-made. The latter and its role in serving the fisheries and the draining of the lagoon have been amply discussed by McCann and needs not to be taken up here (Anon, 1987). At 262 m in length, the 'Spacco della Regina' is the longest of these channels, and, with its shorter pendant 'Piccolo Spacco', it offers a glimpse into the formation of natural clefts in the rugged Ansedonia promontory. The greater of the two owes its evocative name to medieval myths: its eerie character amid occasional skylight, dark tunnel and a cave must have stoked its reputation of haven for brigands. What needs to be stressed, however, is that its entrance has been cut back at least 1.5 m thanks to heavy pounding and scarping of the rock wall. Further, amid 1-6 m wide twists and turns and occasional trickling of water from a no longer visible spring, the 'Spacco della Regina' canal vividly bears witness to substantial man-made manipulation. In particular, large-scale scarping of the walls of rock inside the cave may suggest the preparation of the surface for the accommodation of water-lifting devices of sorts (Fig. 5.4) (De Giorgi 2018). 5 By that rationale, said technology would have lifted the water of the spring to a location (some 30 m above) on the hilltop, seemingly outside Cosa's town walls. Only a handful of holes can be noted in the immediate vicinity of said apparatus, which suggests that the projects may have only supported some light, makeshift mechanisms, or, at worst, had never been brought to completion. While this evidence was noted by McCann and her team, it was, however, never discussed and integrated in the greater discourse of the colony and its maritime outlet. The potential hydraulic implication of this evidence is paramount on two counts: first, it enlarges the breadth of engineering applications that secured a steady supply of fresh water to the hilltop settlement -which had none. Second, and more fundamental, it sheds light on stringent water needs and cultural responses that only local folks could articulate. In short, the community that transformed this promontory in the early 3rd century had a strong command over the technology of the day, whether for construction or hydraulics. They also had an intimate knowledge of the ecology of this region, from the nature of its stone to the amount of rain the area would get each year, as well as the possibilities to capture the few water resources available nearby. That these people were local, and indeed very steeped in this territory, is a cogent possibility. This hypothesis thus advances the well-known historical narrative of Cosa's foundation in the context of the Roman conquest of the 3rd century BC. It also invites a discussion about the making of a colony and its social apparatus. However, the discussion about the circumstances that led to the colony's foundation has been typically relegated to the Roman expansion following the dissolution of the Latin League in 338 BC. The conclusion of the conflict between the Etruscans and the Romans (311-264 BC), in particular, spearheaded the establishment of colonies and led to de facto termination of Etruscan communities. A panoply of captured cities, evocationes of gods and triumphs in Rome is reported by . However, Livy's notion of destruction needs to be treated with caution. Crucially, the Etruscan defeat at Sentino in 295 BC and a fully-fledged expedition in 294 BC against Rusellae, a community lying some 44 km to the northwest of Cosa, represented the watershed for the tightening of Roman pressure in this region. The following years, as reported by Livy, sanctioned the demise of Etruscan communities with a host of yearly campaigns: Tarquinia (281 BC), Vulci (280 BC), Volsinii (280 BC), and Caere (273 BC) are the landmark events in the defeat of the Etruscans. Overall, it is safe to infer that, with Vulci defeated, the district fell under the jurisdiction of Cosa. The survival of Vulci after the conquest has been greatly debated. Plausibly coerced into a foedus, and still under the rule of the aristocracy of old (Satie, Tute and the likes), the town was stripped of most of its landholdings. The end of activities at Ghiaccioforte and Doganella has been traditionally interpreted as evidence of the termination and dispossession enforced by the Romans in 273 BC (Ciampoltrini & Rendini, 1992). The fact of the matter is that this pattern of interruption may not have been as pervasive as one may think. The settlements at Ghiaccioforte, Doganella and possibly Saturnia apparently underwent significant transformations, if not downright disappearance, but the evidence for their termination is tenuous at best. Sovana, for instance, is a conspicuous exception to this trend of widespread destruction: its constellation of 3rd-2nd century BC tombs, some of which of monumental character, namely 'Tomba dell'Ildebranda' and 'Tomba del Tifone', suggest a settlement continuum independent of the colonial reconfiguration of the region (Anon, n.d.). But let us now return to the momentous days of Cosa's foundation and bring into sharper focus the actors involved. The discovery of one Etruscan inscription bearing the names of Larthi and Sethre Auni in the environs of the Arx, if anything, reminds us of the cultural landscape in which Cosa was founded (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). 6 This contested document has been discussed by a host of scholars, from Frank Brown himself to the late Mario Torelli. If anything, it proves, first, that the colony's landscape was lived and traversed by indigenous communities that preceded or coexisted with the arrival of the new settlers. Second, it may also indicate that the colony, enjoying Latin status, may have seemed particularly attractive to non-Romans, and thus accommodated local communities, whether Italic or Etruscan settlers. We can further pursue this avenue into the analysis of Cosa's settlers and their familiarity with the region by delving into the practicalities attended as the colony turned on its engines. Other than defining the wall circuit and bringing together the hilltop and port settlements, the Cosa founders had to take on a more stringent task: providing the community of builders on the hilltop with water, a vital condition for the survival of the colony. Four major reservoirs of 800,000 l capacity each, cut out of the rock, built in polygonal masonry and heavily mortared rubblework finished with a thick coat of cocciopesto, punctuated three gates and the central plateau (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). The establishment of these monumental features not only contributed to the harvesting of rainwater for all sorts of pressing needs, but also spawned the phenomenon of cisterns that in the following centuries peppered the site in the hundreds, big and small, public and private, becoming the cultural signature of this community, a pattern that is particularly visible in the insular Mediterranean. It is fair to say though, that the 3rd century BC was also a time demarcated by the appearance of greatly enhanced water systems in urban contexts that equally drew on centuries of water harvesting strategies. In cities, better than in any other context, a blend of grandeur, ingenuity, and opportunism drove the adoption of engineering arrangements that altered their respective landscapes and local socio-political relations. Cosa is an excellent case in point to demonstrate how water resources were stored, preserved, and delivered to local constituencies. How a disadvantaged community -it had neither a spring nor an aqueduct -effectively supplied its constituency with water and went as far as establishing baths in the early Augustan period, has been brought into focus by recent scholarship (Giorgi, 2018). More fundamentally, from the onset of the colony, cisterns became the architectural signature of the settlement; fall/winter rains and runoffs were the vital requisites for filling these features. But they were more than simple recipients of precipitation. Rather, they were part of a sophisticated retention system that secured a sufficient supply of water for each domestic units and public amenities. The procurement of adequate water supplies was an essential need for the Cosa occupants to survive the seasonal drought of the Tyrrhenian summers. The elucidation of the water management practices and how those practices evolved at Cosa are particularly critical for understanding the development of the ancient town. Why Cosa is located where it is, above and beyond the mantra of 'strategic purposes', has long been the crux of the problem. The absence of aqueducts, springs, or any other year-round water resource nearby that would sustain the community through the dry season has intrigued the scholars of Roman Republican history and archaeology. The role of paved and slightly canted surfaces, as well as conduits designed to shed seasonal runoff into the several large reservoirs throughout the town, continues to be argued. Nevertheless, new data makes it now possible to offer intriguing details about the development of the water system at Cosa, including the role of architecture and aspects of civic government. More subtly, though, the cisterns and their sophisticated impounding systems became the hallmarks of the town and punctuated its built environment in the following centuries, signalling, as they did, an incremental adjustment to overarching environmental conditions and demographic growth. Cosa, however, was not alone in articulating effective, long-lasting strategies to offset meagre precipitation rates, or in showcasing sophisticated water retention systems. A case in point is that of Segni, ancient Signa, in Latium, an early colony of Rome in the 6th century BC and presumably resettled in 495 BC. Here recent excavations in the area of Prato Felici have brought to light a monumental cistern of the second half of the 2nd century BC, built in solid opus caementicium and sheathed with hard signinum (Anon, 2016). The structure negotiated the perimeter of the walls and, considering the height and thickness, was designed to provide its growing community with a fresh reserve of water (well over 900,000 l) (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Amid the flurry of monumental buildings that transformed the townscape of Signa, the new cistern gestured at novel techniques of harvesting water, negotiating the slope of the hill, and replacing the obsolete concept of the round tholos cisterns, hitherto key to sustain the community. Where natural resources fell short, the hand of man brought about correctives. Lastly, moving south across the Italian peninsula, the remarkable 'vasche limarie' of Brundisium (another colony of the Middle Republic) and their complicated network of alimentation remind us of the scale of capital-intensive investment of the water infrastructure and its three historical phases of configuration. More fundamentally, these cisterns remind us of the evolution of Brundisium's water supply system, from the modest array of wells and pipelines of the 3rd century BC to a fully-fledged distribution network in the Trajanic period. Overall, above and beyond the great ingenuity and determination of these builders, these projects ostensibly demonstrate their builders' dexterity in both building long-term infrastructure and engaging it in local ecologies. So far, the essay has showed that this currency of water capture, retention, and delivery was a common strategy both in central and southern Italy during the 3rd century BC in contexts of precarious water supply. But, zeroing back on Cosa, the first generation of the colony and its great investments did not produce the expected results. A rapid survey of archaeological and textual records of a set of colonies that either struggled or became deserted in the decades following their foundation opens new vistas into complicated narratives of settlement and downright abortive foundations (Anon, 2007). The seaports of Buxentum and Sipontum remind us of the frail nature of some of these colonial projects, a far cry from the picture of colonists happily trundling in their ox carts and spearheading the conquest of central Italy. Lukewarm interest in the colony of Cosa, presumably low economic returns, and a generation of young men lost to the Punic Wars may have impacted the demographics of the town. The town walls just described ostensibly encompassed an almost empty landscape. What is more, a few heroa, reminiscent of the mausolea of Anatolia and North Africa and scattered in the countryside along the northeastern road and south of the Arx, were the isolated harbingers of a mortuary landscape that failed to materialize (Fig. 5.7) (Anon, n.d.)(Ciampoltrini, 1991). The mausoleum S-1, south of the Arx, is a gripping example of an austere, isolated tomb that gestures at the viewers and conveys the lofty aspirations of this community in its early days. Who were they? It may appear as though these individuals are more likely to be enterprising equestrians than people anywhere near the rank of senators. A handful of names are worth mentioning: Q. Salonius (of Etruscan extraction or exposure), the families of the Salvii and Tongilii, M. Larius, the artisan Marcus Cusonius, the Titii, and the entrepreneur Quintus Fulvius. Firm conclusions are of course limited. And, to give an idea on how little impact the 5. Cosa, Orbetello, and the genesis of a colony colony had on its surrounding territory, it is worth noting that only two new farms are attested in the vast territory of Cosa (Anon, n.d.). Meanwhile, no durable houses were built: the construction of domestic units within the colony is not attested, based on the archaeological record, until the first quarter of the 2nd century BC. During this phase of early recession, Cosa's narrative of settlement gets seemingly even more interlocked with that of her doppelganger, the elusive Etruscan settlement of Orbetello. Whether serving as epineion or not, this community did not fare well either after the 3rd century BC, slowly fading into disuse in less than a century, for reasons that are a matter of dispute. Our current research is testing the underwater sediments through their matrix and organic components (ostracods included), and it appears that a reduction of sea level and oscillations in the salinity may have adversely affected conditions of the lagoon, making the anchorage unserviceable. Recently, Paolo Liverani has moved forward this debate suggesting some compelling interpretative frameworks that help us model the relationship between Orbetello and Cosa (Anon, n.d.). In particular, he posits that the dialectic between the two sites may have followed the pattern seen at Volsinii and Falerii, with a similar interplay between Vetus and Novus, and the subsequent eclipse of the earlier settlement. In this vein, Orbetello, the putative 'Cosa Vetus', would have not only adumbrated the settlement that later occupied the Ansedonia hill, but also significantly contributed to its demography, thanks to a substantial transfer of population in 197 BC, an event that is textually documented . Of course, these are hypotheses that, though suggestive, remain an argument from silence. But it is fair to say that it is the fluid nature of the colonization process, and notably the establishment of Latin colonies, known for their less regimented configuration and accessibility to non-Romans, that perhaps enabled the transfer of Orbetello's population to the colony of (Anon, n.d.) remarks, Cosa in 197 BC was accorded the privilege to choose their second draft of colonists, and it stands to reason that they chose those they knew best. How Orbetello fared in the aftermath of these transformations we are not in the position to tell. A small, albeit elusive settlement lingered on in the following centuries, as suggested by tenuous signs of occupation in the area of the main sanctuary, today deeply buried under the Duomo (Calastri 2019). Not a whole lot of information, but enough to infer that Cosa indeed eclipsed Orbetello and offered a better anchorage, while presenting better opportunities to its stakeholders and community members. Cosa's development seized the opportunity of new forces and resources, ushering in a town plan that was not as rationally conceived as Brown had it. The appearance of monuments in the 2nd century BC need not to be taken up here, as it is documented by a wealth of scholarship (Anon, n.d.). Instead, I would like to focus on the eccentricities of Cosa's plan, as they vividly appear in the archaeological record. Our geophysical survey makes it plain that entire blocks of the town remained empty and created space for bouts of construction that never materialized. (Plate 5.1). The nature of the terrain hindered the development of the colony and limited the extent of a number of axes of traffic, thus presenting a picture that is at variance with the traditional view of Cosa. Street N near the bath and Street 6 were blocked by the superimposition of buildings. Street 7 is also a great case in point, as there is evidence of buildings that faced away from the forum and opened on streets that are clear examples of this trend. What is more, the rugged topography of the town had to be reckoned with. Street 5, for instance, long believed to be the backbone of the town, had a steep gradient that made it impossible for carts and heavy traffic to move between the northwestern gate ('Porta Fiorentina') and the forum. The presence of a putative horreum and its adjacent small square next to the northwestern gate, however, are suggestive of the activities that unfolded on the fringes of the town and the priorities that dictated the partition of space. The horreum, initially interpreted as 'Temple A', was hastily investigated in 1972 (Anon, n.d.). Adjacent to the northwestern gate, the building lies on a 41.81 × 28.12 m terrace made of polygonal masonry linked to the 3rd-century BC fortification walls. Apparently, a system of storage rooms in the rear and possible tabernae on the wings articulated a space traversed by a drainage channel and accessed via a ramp, thus facilitating the movement of carts. The excavation, however, limited its inspection to partition walls and portico, glossing over key-issues such as the nature of the finds and phases of use. Furthermore, the field notes mention only in passing the presence of large, broken containers for the storage of foodstuff, failing to discuss the nature of the building. A small collection of 2nd-to 3rd-century AD ceramics offers a general snapshot of use. However, it stands to reason that the planning of the building and its realization harken back to the early days of the colony in the 3rd century BC. While the test-trenches excavated in 1972 could only partially reveal the exact configuration of the building, it nevertheless seems clear that a market adjacent to a main gate of the town was a key feature early on. It functioned as a portal to Cosa's vast territory and constituents, moving traffic to and from the town thanks to its easy access to the via Aurelia. It also cemented Cosa to its environs in economic and cultural terms. Grain and timber for ship construction may have been key commodities in the unfolding of these networks, and the metrical inscription of Titus Caesius Taurinus from Praeneste (CIL XIV 2852) is a good case in point. But in the 2nd century BC, the provision and transport of grain for the North Italian and Spanish campaigns would have provided economic opportunities for the community (Scott, 2019). Perhaps, commercial areas as lenses can help us shift the pendulum away from the via sacra and the Arx and explore the foci that best capture the town and its development in the 2nd century BC, once conflicts were settled and the colony had to reinvent its identity. Once again, our geophysical survey offers the possibility to corroborate this perspective. A substantial building lies northwest of the forum. It is approximately 48 × 78 m in size, with a large courtyard, portico, and rooms on its northwest and northeast sides. At the centre of the southeastern sector is also a rectangular feature. The monumental character of the building can be gleaned from the 0.9 m width of one of the walls that appears on the surface. What is more, the masonry consists of large rectangular limestone blocks, thus at variance with Cosa's ubiquitous 2nd century BC opus incertum. The location of the building is also of interest, both in terms of its positioning in relation to axes of traffic and the adjacent forum. In particular, it is served by Street O and thus easily accessible from the northeastern gate ('Porta Romana') which connected the site to the main arteries of traffic, to wit the via Aurelia, established in 241 BC, and the road that, following that eastern slope of the town, eventually merged with the port's road access. Overall, location, size, and accessibility make it plain that this establishment must have been included in the initial planning of the colony or in the extensive monumentalization of the town in the 2nd century BC. The function of the building, of course, is the issue, and we should bear in mind that this is but a rendition of a seemingly complicated edifice. Nevertheless, the presence of small units, plausibly tabernae, that is space for retail and commercial activities, may suggest a commercial space, and, in particular, the building that accommodated the daily practices and routines of the people who lived at Cosa. The most compelling example of a structure of this nature, albeit different in layout, is the early macellum and adjacent system of tabernae at Alba Fucens, another Latin colony founded in 303 BC. An early macellum, flanked by tabernae was located southeast of the forum and adjacent to the basilica. A commercial space is a desirable addition to the urban fabric at Cosa, and, more importantly, it would clarify the almost wholesale lack of tabernae from excavated houses, with the exception of the House of Diana and some of the so-called 'atria publica' adjacent to the forum. This history as so far revealed is at odds with the prevailing view that assumes a monolithic concept of foundation and a few ad hoc adjustments. Instead, this essay contends that the making of the colony was a fundamentally local enterprise, while the transfer of the Orbetello community not only injected new life, but also gave the opportunity to rethink the urban project and its sustainability. What is more, integrating the port and the commercial areas in new frameworks furthers our understanding of the colony and its genesis. We are of course only at the beginning of work, and I suppose these projects could be viewed as merely a new coat of paint for an old house. But the returns Cosa has given to our knowledge of the archaeology of Roman Italy seem to me fully to justify their pursuit. Bace, E. J. ( 1983 1.

On-going research is designed to fully investigate these remains: Gilles Broacard and Jean-Philippe Goiran are my partners. Although it was stated that 'The sides of this natural fracture have been scarped along various sections to remove splintering and overhanging limestone' (Anon, n.d.), this seems hardly the case: the accurate, levelling of the vertical wall of rock has to be seen as a preparation for accommodating some kind of scaffolding or lifting apparatus. 6. While this heavily battered stone was found in a dump during the excavation of the temple of Jupiter, its lettering may hint a 3rd-1st-century BC origin, and possibly after the colonial deductio. The aim of this paper is to give a general overview of the current state of our knowledge of the Latin colony of Fregellae, including some new data that have emerged in ongoing research, albeit in the necessarily limited space available. As part of the commission received in 2011 from Filippo Coarelli to edit the excavations of the temples in the forum and along the via Latina (Anon, n.d.)) and of the 18 domus on Decumanus I (currently being published) conducted between 1980 and 2009 by the University of Perugia, I examined and reorganised all the documentation and coordinated the study of the structures and materials found. Moreover, thanks to the collaboration of the Soprintendenza, Belle Arti e Paesaggio per le Province di Latina e Frosinone (SABAP Latina Frosinone), I was also able to access their archives to study the data contained therein. Situated in Latium Adiectum in a strategic position along the via Latina, the colony of Fregellae (Fig. 6.1) was one of the most flourishing Italian cities of its time. Its trade occurred both by land and by river along the route connecting Rome to Capua and along the valleys of the rivers Sacco and Liri, ending at the Minturnae seaport. Founded by Rome in 328 BC to control the territory of Fabrateria disputed between the Volscians and Samnites, it was conquered by the latter in 316 BC and then re-founded by Rome between 313 and 312, together with the foundation of Interamna Lirenas, while the via Latina was being extended to Capua (an examination of all relevant ancient sources can be found in (Anon, n.d.)(Rawson, 1998)(Maiuri, 2009)(Balbo, 2016)(Laffi, 2017). For a long time Fregellae represented for Rome a stronghold and one of the most devoted and loyal colonies; the wealthy local aristocracy was proud of its military and political role, stopping Pyrrhus' advance in 280 BC and Hannibal's in (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). 6. The archaeology of Fregellae: an update 211 BC, acting as the leader of the Latin colonies hostile to the Carthaginian general in 209 BC. The knights of the turma fregellana also took part in the war against Antiochus III of Syria . The town was besieged and destroyed in 125 BC by Rome itself for its claim to extend Roman citizenship rights. This exemplary punishment entailed the deportation to Rome of the most influential citizens to be tried and sentenced to death and the performance of the rite of devotio on the defeated enemy town (as happened to Veii, Corinth and Carthage: Macrob. Sat. 3.9), with the demolition of all buildings, public and private, the cutting of water channels and the throwing of salt onto the fields. A vexed question is whether or not building materials were recovered from the now-destroyed Fregellae for the construction of the new colony of Fabrateria Nova, founded nearby in 124 BC. This is likely to have been the case, but it has left no particularly obvious traces. Roman soldiers plundered the town as spoils of war before destroying it and, as we shall see later, there are archaeological contexts of destruction that appear to be intact and not disturbed by later interventions. In addition, no material datable to a period significantly later than 125 BC has been found that would attest to a renewed frequentation of the urban area. The importance of Fregellae for Roman archaeology thus lies in its being a closed context, at least in its urban area, where life stopped in 125 BC and never resumed. The study of building techniques, architectural solutions, and material culture more generally may thus allow a better understanding of their chronology. The territory on which Fregellae was established was inhabited, even before Volscian domination, by people whose material culture and religious conceptions were akin to the Latin world, even though at present it is still not possible to link them to a specific Italic population. Their settlement is indicated by votive offerings found in the area of the suburban temple on the via Latina and by ceramic materials, especially bucchero and bucchero-type pottery, found in secondary deposition in various excavation contexts within the town, all datable between the last quarter of the 7th and the 5th centuries BC. Furthermore, an antefix featuring the head of Silenus and dated to the 5th century BC (Fig. 6.2) attests the presence of a sacred building in the sector of the domus north of the Comitium (Anon, n.d.). The 4th century BC represents a hiatus in the occupation of the plateau, where clashes took place between the Volscians and Samnites, while two strongholds on high ground surrounded by polygonal walls controlled it: that of Rocca d'Arce to the north, on the right bank of the Liri, and that of Falvaterra to the south, on the left bank (the latter still unpublished, see Diosono 2019a, 100). The colony was founded by Rome immediately east of the Liri, hence the reason for the dispute with the Samnites. The fertile and well-connected territory of the colony must have been extensive, broadly corresponding to the territories of the two modern municipalities of Arce and Ceprano. In previous centuries, fortuitous discoveries and excavations were made in search of archaeological evidence. Between 1978 and 1984, the University of Cambridge, under the direction of Michael Crawford and in collaboration with the University of Perugia, carried out surveys in the area with targeted trenches, the results of which have been partially published (Crawford, 1981)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Crawford & Keppie, 1984)(Crawford et al., 1985)(Anon, n.d.). Further surveys were conducted by other research groups (Nicosia, 1979)(Malandrino, 1991)(Monti, 1998). Various hypotheses on the centuriation were also made (Monti, 1992). After the destruction of the town in 125 BC, its territory was referred to as Fregellanum in the sources and must have still been inhabited and productive: a periodic market was held there at a temple (Anon, n.d.), and a villa from the imperial period has also been excavated there (Betori, 2009). Currently, the project 'A Landscape of Conflict: Battlefield Archaeology in the Territory of Ancient Fregellae / Modern Ceprano (FR, Lazio, Italy)' directed by Dominik Maschek is seeking traces of the siege of the town. The conservation activities conducted by the Soprintendenza have also, in recent years, brought to light other evidence, coeval or subsequent to the colony (Molle & Marandola, 2016)(Anon, n.d.). Between 2004 and 2005 a short geophysical prospection project conducted by the British School at Rome led to a reconstructive hypothesis of the layout of the wall circuit (Anon, 2008), which still needs to be verified in the field. Conventionally, the plateau, naturally delimited by differences in elevations, continues to be identified with the urban area. It is crossed longitudinally by the via Latina (corresponding to the present 'Via di Opi') on a northwest-southeast axis, which constitutes the town's cardo, on which the three decumani known so far are set perpendicularly. However, our knowledge of the town is still too limited to attempt a reconstruction of its urban fabric. In addition to the excavated buildings presented in this chapter, we only know that the regular distance between the three decumani leads to the formation of 6. The archaeology of Fregellae: an update elongated insulae. Jeremia (Anon, 2008) has tried reconstructing the town's layout by replicating the same house module and extending it in order to outline various insulae within the hypothesised town area. In fact, the domus excavated so far seems to present at least two different dimensional modules, both attested in the group of domus on Decumanus I. Consequently, smaller and larger houses do not seem to have belonged to distinctive quarters linked with the different status of the residents and were in fact grouped together. As for the preliminary settlement operations, it seems that, in a phase preceding the construction of the buildings, wells were dug at several points of the urban area, even though many of them went permanently out of use at the time the domus were built. Excavations in the forum area were conducted by the University of Perugia in the 1980s-90s. A general, if partial, synthesis of the results has been published (Anon, n.d.), together with a recent in-depth study of the small temple at the northeast corner of the square, built at the time of the foundation of the colony and redecorated in the 2nd century BC (Anon, n.d.). The excavations also brought to light the curia/comitium complex (almost completely spoliated after 125 BC), a double row of pits on the two short sides of the square, a fountain, a large underground hydraulic canal running lengthwise and a building on the east side that was identified at the times as a macellum. A survey carried out in 2004-05 by the University of Perugia in collaboration with the British School at Rome revealed the presence of at least one other public building with rich architectural terracotta decorations on the southwest side of the forum (Anon, 2008). Due to the shallow depth at which the ancient remains are buried and the fact that the forum is located on the highest point of the plateau, the preservation of the structures has been severely compromised in recent years, even following the excavations, by agricultural works and building activities, whether authorised or not. North of the comitium is a residential complex named 'domus of Opi 1' in the excavation documentation of the University of Perugia, which has never been the subject of systematic study. In 1975, a landslide affected a side of the hill on which the Sanctuary of Aesculapius stood and on which the loading basin of a still functioning power station was built. The landslide brought to light approximately 3,000 artefacts, including many fictile votive offerings, which were recovered under the direction of Anna Gallina Zevi, officer of the Soprintendenza (this material remains unpublished). Some architectural elements and building materials had already been found in 1927. From 1978 and 1984 the area of the Sanctuary was excavated by the University of Perugia (from 1978 to 1980 by the University of Cambridge too). Although the results of this operation were published as a volume (Anon, n.d.), this only included the materials from the 1978 excavation campaign, with the rest remaining almost entirely unpublished. Conservation activities, which I conducted under the direction of Alessandro Betori at the time when the power station was being expanded, led to the discovery of further material from the Sanctuary scattered in the plain to the southwest (also unpublished). The attribution of the largest known sacred complex in the Latin colony to Aesculapius has not been questioned so far (Lippolis, 2009)(Känel, 2015) and is based on the discovery of inscriptions referring to the god and his paredra Salus. The extra-urban complex stood on high ground to the west of the town, overlooking it from above, facing southeast. The presence of large block-built retaining walls on the side of the hill could suggest its interpretation as a terraced sanctuary. A sizable drainage channel for water flowing down the valley was also found. The hypothesis that downhill from the temple stood a theatre facing the town has so far found no support in the field. The temple had a transverse cella, leaning against a portico on three sides, and had two building phases (280-240 BC and 180-150 BC), of the oldest of which only few walls and the thesaurus, of Greek rather than Roman type (Anon, n.d.), remain. Following looting activities in the 19th century, the first materials related to the temple were documented in 1990 when works linked with the widening of 'Via di Opi' (which, as mentioned, roughly follows the ancient route of the via Latina) damaged its front. Subsequently, geophysical prospection and two excavation campaigns (Anon, n.d.) were there carried out by University of Perugia. All materials and data have recently been published (Anon, n.d.). The temple stood just outside the northern entrance to the town and its architectural features and cultic materials have led to it being attributed to the cult of Bona Dea. Like almost all buildings from Fregellae, it also features two decorative phases: one relating to the years when the colony was established and the other to the 2nd century BC. It must have stood near a spring, which dried up following the construction of the A1 motorway, which heavily modified the surrounding landscape. The various drains found in the temple area must have been connected to this spring and the ritual use of its water. The Baths (the large building at the top right in Fig. 6.3) were excavated by the University of Perugia under the coordination of Vassilis Tsiolis and Giovanna Battaglini from 1996 to 2001, when their presentation as a museum was initiated, with further works carried out between 2007 and 2009. The excavation of the thermal building was then completed in 2017, as part of restoration activities, promoted by Carlo Molle (SABAP Latina Frosinone) and directed by me in the field. The results are presented here for the first time (in a necessarily condensed format) together with the subsequent new reconstructive hypothesis. The subject of preliminary publications, most of which have dealt with architectural aspects (Tsiolis, 2001)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) The archaeology of Fregellae: an update (Coarelli, 2004)(Vincenti, 2008)(Anon, n.d.), the Baths have so far been described as having two building phases, the first datable to the last 30 years of the 3rd century BC and the second to the first quarter of the 2nd century BC (Anon, n.d.). This chronology is based on a thorough architectural analysis, but not on the materials found during the various stratigraphic excavations, which have only been studied to a small extent (Pedroni, 1997)(Anon, 2008)(Anon, n.d.) and are in fact completely unpublished. The first phase is mainly visible at the front of the Baths, which faces the Decumanus I, due to excavations which took place in the 19th century, if not before, and which completely destroyed the second phase (above it) in order to reach valuable artefacts further below. Evidence of this are the terracotta telamons that ended up in the Campana collection and then in the Louvre (Hausmesser, 2018), as well as the other eventually walled-up in the church of Ceprano (Anon, n.d.). These upheavals have thus allowed modern excavation to proceed to a considerable depth in a fairly large sector, revealing several rooms whose floor level is similar to that of the oldest phase of the domus I.7 across the street (also presented in the museum). Deep soundings excavated in 2007 revealed a furnace further north that can also be attributed to the first phase (Anon, n.d.) to as 'saggio N' instead of 'saggio alfa'), which is thus much larger than initially assumed, even though its overall dimensions are not known at present. The second phase extends from Decumanus I, which it faces as in the previous phase, to Decumanus II. The entrance is monumental, with four half-columns leaning against pillars set on the sidewalk, which supported a roof decorated with architectural terracottas. There was also a side access, with a narrow passageway running outside the east side, with a threshold opening into Room 13 , the excavation of which is discussed below. The west side of the Baths was instead adjacent to a domus that has not been investigated, but which was seen during the modern roofing of the Baths. The foundations in limestone blocks are all that remains of the front part, whereas the rest of the complex features rich floors and some structures such as bathtubs with furnaces, seats covered in cocciopesto and labra supports. The rooms were vaulted with a system of curved tiles on ribs (Tsiolis, 2001)). The walls were probably made of unfired clay (mudbrick), as were those of the various domus, which was likely the case also in the earliest phase of this building. The part of the second phase displayed in the museum does not include the entire building: the northern sector, probably consisting of service rooms, is not visible, but was located on a higher terrace supported by a low polygonal retaining wall. The stratigraphy associated with the second phase was better preserved away from Decumanus I, and this made it possible to investigate, in several places, the destruction contexts datable to 125 BC together with what was sealed beneath them (Diosono, 2017)). The area excavated in 2017 (Fig. 6.4) is in the northeast sector of the museum part of the Baths, below the modern roof. The subject of repeated excavations by the University of (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)), these rooms have not been assigned a name. In conformity with the previously published plans of this 6. The archaeology of Fregellae: an update building, the northernmost is here referred to as Room 13 and the southernmost as Room 14. Room 13 yielded a layer with a high concentration of materials, which was also below the column shaft that was later relocated on its stylobate in the 2007 restoration. Its limits are defined to the north, by the polygonal wall that supports the northern sector of the Baths; to the east, by the perimeter wall in limestone blocks from the second phase of the baths, on which the already mentioned external access opens, framed by two long perpendicular jambs; to the west and south, by wall sections consisting of a stone plinth surmounted by fractured tile remains (originally likely supporting earthen walls), featuring later additions in reused blocks and a small dolium (filled with ash). The stratigraphy also shows destruction and levelling activity for the construction of a third phase in this sector, also evident in Room 14 and in the open space to the west of Rooms 13 and 14. The polygonal wall would also seem to belong to this third phase, because its clay foundation is at a higher height than the structures of the second phase. Room 14, to the south of the previous room, is defined, to the east, by the eastern limestone block wall of the second phase of the Baths; to the south, by the wall of the alveus of the eastern sector, also belonging to the second phase of the Baths. However, it has no clear boundary with the adjacent area to the west, excavated in 2007, except for the presence of a large third-phase pillar. Beneath the destruction layer of 125 BC (made up of collapsed earthen walls with some building material), this room also shows traces of a third phase: there is evidence of flooring preparation on which fragments of burnt tufa blocks and fragments of cocciopesto had accumulated; these look like components of the alvei already known from the Baths and appear to be demolished parts of a structure exposed to strong heat and covered with hydraulic cocciopesto. Underneath the floor preparation lay the beaten earth of the second phase, in which evidence for the removal of drains and some dolia partly inserted into the ground was evident. Thus, it seems that Room 14 changed its function in the third phase: the level was raised, one of the large pillars was constructed, and waste building materials were piled up there, probably related to the maintenance of the thermal facilities. The earlier phase identified during this excavation seems to correspond with what is traditionally referred to as the second phase of the Baths. The 2017 excavation thus calls into question the two-phase chronology of the Baths proposed so far in the published studies, adding a third one, as suggested by the stratigraphy and the sequence of structures, at least in the northern sector. But regardless of this last excavation campaign, work during the construction of the museum between 2007 and 2008 had already highlighted inconsistencies with the reconstructions then proposed and that have continued to be proposed, even in relation to the front. Indeed, an analysis of the various levels of visible structures and floors shows that the building layout and sequence is much more complex than the plans and analyses published to date. In fact, even by looking at the structure as it is visible today (Fig. 6. The archaeology of Fregellae: an update • The wall E in tufa and limestone blocks, interpreted as the east perimeter wall of the second phase, rest on that 40 cm layer of clay which covers the first phase floors A and rests at a higher elevation than the second phase internal walls B. This would create an unlikely construction solution, in which the perimeter walls, which bear more weight, are placed at an higher elevation (and on a layer of clay) than the inner walls B, which rest on floors A (the latter covered by the clay on which wall E rests). It is thus likely that walls E and B did not belong to the same phase, rather wall E goes with floors C (second phase) and walls B with floor F (intermediate phase between the first and second). In summary, while the northern sector of the Baths shows a period of reorganisation subsequent to the second phase and prior to the destruction of 125 BC, the southern sector points to a planimetric and structural reorganisation intermediate between the first and the second phases, whose plan and interpretations should, therefore, be revised. The above discussion highlights how the dossier of the Baths, their different building phases, reconstructive plans, and functional interpretations of the rooms must be tackled anew, combining a planimetric study conducted on the three dimensions with that of the numerous materials found in the stratigraphy. Between 1980 and 1999 the University of Perugia team excavated 18 domus on Decumanus I (Fig. 6.3) and worked on the Archaeological Park, under the coordination of Paolo Braconi and Giovanna Battaglini. Between 2000 and 2009, these activities were exclusively related to the preparation of the museum and restoration of the structures within the Archaeological Park, which include some of the domus on Decumanus I (the others were re-interred) and the Baths (preliminary publications (Anon, n.d.)(Battaglini & Diosono, 2010)(Känel, 2010)(Anon, 2019). A volume soon to be published by the Accademia dei Lincei (Diosono et al. forthcoming) will include extensive discussion of the size-modules attested for these houses, their different internal organisation linked to the various forms of use of the different spaces, the two building phases identified and their chronology, the construction techniques, the rich decoration, and aspects of the domestic cult. Even though it is not possible to discuss here the content of unpublished studies by others (which I have access to in my role as volume editor), it seems reasonable to briefly summarise one of the lines of research that I have personally contributed to. The excavation of these domus has shed new light on the domestic sphere and daily life of a period of Roman history in which they are not particularly well known. In fact, many of the contexts excavated at Fregellae are well preserved and relate to the time of the destruction of the domus, as well as the other buildings in the town, in 125 BC. The study of the finds (preliminary publications (Guidobaldi, 1989)(Anon, 2008)(Diosono, 2019)(Diosono et al., 2019)) was carried out by also considering, when stratigraphically reliable, their spatial location. We were thus able to reconstruct a definite picture of the materials present in various houses at the time of their collapse (clearly following a general sacking of the town by the Roman army). The opportunity to analyse in great detail the material culture from various dwellings made it possible to note similarities and differences in the eating and consumption habits of the different households. Given the profound connection that links the sphere of food and nutrition with the cultural identity of an individual or a community, as well as with the expression of social and economic relations, this analysis allowed me to better understand the varied complexity of the inhabitants of this ancient town. Indeed, food represents a substantial part of a society's daily activities and is also one of the most conservative. From the study of how food and drink are preserved, prepared, and consumed, much can be understood about the inhabitants of a settlement, relating, of course, to the trade networks that guarantee the supply of imported products. In colonial areas or, more generally, any area where social groups and individuals of different origin coexist, this kind of study may help to illuminate their interactions and transformations. The quantitative study of the finds in the different domus allows us to state that in the 2nd century BC different culinary and cooking practices typical of the Roman-Latin area, as well as of Magna Graecia and southern Italian regions, coexisted at Fregellae. At the same time, the ceramic material used for cooking and eating was almost exclusively of local production (Anon, n.d.). Different food customs therefore coexisted within the same house, either because people with different habits lived there or because a hybrid cuisine had developed at the intersection of the different traditions. On the one hand, as attested by the presence of forms and types of kitchen pottery of a different tradition than those widespread in the area under examination, it is possible to hypothesise the presence of individuals and family units of non-Latin origin within the Latin colony. On the other hand, over time and through cohabitation, the dietary customs of the first generations of colonists began to incorporate other culinary traditions introduced by the arrival of new inhabitants of other origins, so that the town began to produce and use local pottery suitable for these different recipes. The material culture effectively confirms what is reported in historical sources, which describe Fregellae in the 2nd century BC as characterised by a massive immigration of Italics (e.g. (Anon, n.d.) writes of 40,000 Samnites and Pelignians present in the town in 177 BC). Names of Italic origins are also found stamped on locally produced black-glazed pottery (Nonnis, 1998)(Anon, n.d.). This immigration appears to have been generally characterised by a peaceful integration between the various elements, old and new, of the urban body (Coarelli, 1991)(Anon, n.d.), even though, over time, the Fregellan aristocracy tended to move to Rome, whilst the inhabitants began to request the granting of Roman citizenship as a way of distinguishing themselves from the newcomers. The multiformity and cultural complexity of Fregellae are also evidenced by other aspects of the material culture: the contacts and familiarity with the Greek and 6. The archaeology of Fregellae: an update eastern world (already indicated by the early cult of Aesculapius) are attested by Greek craftsmen active in the town or by decorative themes inspired by that world (Anon, n.d.)(Känel, 2010)(Anon, n.d.)(Vincenti, 2021)) and also by the good quantity of Greek pottery found, consisting in particular of amphorae. They also help us to identify material traces of another fact reported in the sources and so far probably underestimated, namely the arrival of 200 families of Punic aristocracy in 202 BC, hostages after the battle of Zama, who asked to reside here and not in . Their presence is made tangible, among other things, by the sheer quantity of amphorae of Punic production that have been found in Fregellae. Their number is absolutely above average when compared to other centres in inland Italy of the same period, and they furthermore attest that contacts with Punic territories continued even after the fall of Cartage in 146 BC. One should always dress like a marble column (Jackie Kennedy-Onassis): new insights on the urbanism of Alba Fucens Cécile Evers Alba Fucens is a town located in the present-day Abruzzo region, in the ancient territory of the Aequii, on the border with the Marsi, at the foot of the Apennines, with the mighty silhouette of Monte Velino towering up at an altitude of nearly 2,500 m north of the town. It is situated along the via Valeria (Wonterghem & Fr, 1983)(Anon, n.d.), the continuation of the via Tiburtina, 68 miles (100 km) east of Rome on a hilltop 1,022 m above sea level, and 300 m higher than the (agricultural) plain around it (Plate 7.1). Easy to access and even easier to defend, it strategically controls the Fucine lake basin and all the roads passing through this major hub of Central Italy, connecting Etruria to Campania and Rome to the Adriatic coast. Alba was established as a Latin colony in 303 BC, at the end of the Second Samnite War, to control the newly conquered territories (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The large number of 6,000 colonists was settled (Livy 10.1) in this kind of autonomous city state. It kept a strong bond with its mother city and continued to be a staunch ally of the Romans during the Republic. In 211 BC, during the Second Punic War, when Hannibal made a bold march on Rome in an attempt to liberate Capua, besieged by the Roman legions, and set up camp just four miles away from the City, it was the only colony that responded to the Roman's cry for help. The Albenses did immediately send 2,000 men to defend the city walls (App. Hann. 39). Hannibal left five days later. Exhausted by the wars though, Alba sided with the 11 colonies that refused to send new troops in 209 BC and was obliged to do so in 204 BC, but with a contingent twice as numerous as a punishment. Built as an impregnable stronghold, it was conveniently used to host important state prisoners, such as the dethroned kings Syphax of Numidia (203 BC), Perseus of Macedonia (168 BC), and Bituitus of the Arverni (121 BC). During the Social War (91-89 BC), the inhabitants of Alba, although in the middle of the territory of the insurgents (socii) and besieged by them, stayed faithful to the Roman Republic (Livy Per. 72). In 89 BC, the consul L. Porcius Cato died next to the Fucine lake during an attempt to retake the territory of the Marsi. But the war was over for the allied forces and Alba, like many other cities, benefited from the Lex Iulia de civitate Latinis danda (90 BC) and subsequently became a municipium of Roman citizens, administered by a board of four elected magistrates, the quattuorviri -two iure dicundo and two aediles (Letta et al., 2019)(Anon, n.d.). The peace was short. During the Civil Wars of the 1st century BC, the town found itself again on the front line of hostilities. In 78 BC Cornelius Scipio entrenched himself in the town against Sulla. The town was besieged and taken, Scipio killed (Anon, n.d.)). Alba sided with Caesar in 49 BC and later with his heir Octavian, choosing wisely on both occasions. Caesar had great plans for the draining of the nearby Fucine lake, but his assassination stopped everything (Suet. Iul. 44.5). Augustus could not afford to follow suit, but Claudius did, in line with his policy to take over the dictator's infrastructure projects (Anon, n.d.). Claudius tried to control the water level -and gain fertile land -by having an impressive drainage tunnel (5.6 km long) dug into the hill of Monte Salviano, allowing the overflow to be discharged into the Liri river. According to Suetonius, the works took 11 years (between AD 41 and 52) and employed 30,000 workers. But the result was not satisfactory and the first inauguration ceremony a disaster (Plin. HN 36.24.124; Tac. Ann. (Anon, n.d.). The lake seems to have been finally successfully drained by Hadrian (SHA Hadr. 22.13), with the works having been completed in AD 149 (under Antoninus Pius), leaving only the central part, mostly what is today called the 'Bacinetto' underwater (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Large tracts of agricultural -and very fertile -land were gained, benefitting the economy of Alba and of the smaller local towns (esp. Marruvium). Tetrarchic portraits (Anon, n.d.) cat. 14-18, pl. IX-XI; LSA-1045-1049) and a milestone bearing the clumsily erased name of Magnentius (AD 350-351) (De Ruyt 1982, 156-160 cat. 190, pl. LIII; Van Wonterghem 1983, 10-11, fig. 8; EDR078542; HD002781; EDCS-13900464) testify to the wealth of the town during the late 3rd and 4th centuries AD. The last known inscription mentioning works (doors) on a public building dates from AD 362 (CIL IX 3921; Letta 2012a, 20, 41 cat. 35; EDR185085; EDCS-14804951). The last literary source is from Procopius (Goth. 2.7, 25.34), who wrote that the army of the magister militium John, sent by Justinian to help Belisarius besieged in Rome by the Ostrogoths, overwintered in Alba in AD 537, if we assume that the localisation in Picenum is wrong. The settlement, on the Alba hill, is shaped like an elongated lozenge (1,150 m long × 675 m wide) (Fig. 7.1) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Ceccaroni, 2006)). There are three summits: the San Nicola hill (1,016 m a.s.l., commonly interpreted as the old 7. One should always dress like a marble column (Jackie Kennedy-Onassis) acropolis, where the medieval village, Alba Vecchia -destroyed by the lethal 1915 earthquake (Anon, n.d.) -was situated), the Pettorino (990 m a.s.l., with a temple) and the San Pietro Hill (992 m a.s.l., with a temple reused as a church). The central valley lying in between them, c. 100 m wide, contains the main public buildings of the town. Oriented northwest-southeast, it follows a downward slope (from 960 to 949 m a.s.l.), beginning, at the highest end, with the Northern Terrace (a campus), followed by the forum, then the downtown area (the Piano di Cività with macellum, baths and tabernae), the Sanctuary of Hercules and, finally, a square with an exedra and a temple probably dedicated to eastern deities at the lowest point. The houses were built on the upper terraces flanking the valley and the main temples on the hilltops, with the notable exception of the Sanctuary of Hercules. The whole town (c. 34 ha) is defended by an impressive wall in polygonal masonry, almost 3 km long. But Alba wasn't built in one day. The chronological sequence of the urbanisation is quite intricate (Mertens, 1988)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). • Stage A (3rd century BC) • A.1: The first works are of a definite military nature: the defence walls in cyclopean masonry bear witness to the town's original function as a fortress in newly conquered territories. Their chronology has been partly revised by Daniela Liberatore (Anon, n.d.). The initial defensive circuit was constructed at mid-slope, following the orography, and included the Alba Vecchia, Pettorino and probably San Pietro hills. The walls were built according to what Giuseppe Lugli calls the 'seconda maniera', sometimes quite fine, made of medium-sized blocks. They were obviously repaired, improved, provided with a tower and new gates during their long life (Anon, n.d.) [phases e-g], 130-131 [phases II-IV]). • A.2: The drainage of the area was indispensable, as the main part of the town lies in a small valley, functioning as an alluvial basin. Like in Rome, where the area of the forum could only be used after the construction of the Cloaca Maxima, the Roman engineers built early on a large drain that runs the length of the town, and numerous canalisations, all of which have been explored, cleared and mapped by our team of archaeo-speleologists since 2010 (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Vrielynck, 2017); partly used by (Anon, n.d.). The sewerage system of the town is indeed quite impressive and very complex, mirroring the urbanistic evolution of the colony. Almost every taberna is also provided with a well and some quite large ones have been found, even recently, like the one in the sanctuary of Hercules, in front of the sacellum (Anon, n.d.). Water was plentiful, even before the Augustan (?) construction of the aqueduct (Anon, n.d.). Geological soundings in the southern part of the square of the of Herculean complex have shown that this valley bottom area was an inhabitable marshland before the drainage works and levelling works carried out by the Roman colonists (Galadini, 2013)(Anon, n.d.)). • A.3: Urban planning: construction of the terrace walls, levelling of the forum area (and of the further squares?), construction of the necessary administrative buildings (comitium and curia, forum, plus the sacred Herculean complex). Forum and comitium were built on 'virgin' soil. An orthogonal plan is laid out in the central valley, with parallel and perpendicular streets oriented by the via Valeria ('Via del Miliario'). The insulae follow this pattern, are oblong, c. 30-40 m wide and 80-110 m long. Most of the official buildings are built along this axis (comitium, forum, basilica, macellum, Herculean complex). On both sides of this political-administrative zone, a long row of shops with a portico in front of them are aligned. The orthogonal plan is also visible in the structures (domus publicae) underneath the basilica (built during the first half of the 2nd century BC). Even on the central-eastern slope, all the oldest buildings are set in the orthogonal plan, which was kept during the whole lifespan of the town. The main temples, on the Pettorino and San Pietro hills, were also constructed during the 3rd century BC. • Stage B (2nd century BC): the town is monumentalised according to Hellenistic models. Part of this monumentalisation, i.e. the terracing of the hill slopes leading to the temples, the Basilica, porticoes of the Herculean sanctuary, porticoes on the streets, as well as the paving of the streets, are dated by Mertens to the 2nd and beginning of the 1st centuries BC, but following the original pattern which must have been clearly delineated on the ground. • Stage C (after the destructions of the civil wars): the town is completely reconstructed. • Stage D (2nd century AD): embellishment of the public and private buildings. • Stage E (from the 3rd century AD onwards): decline. The site has been excavated by a Belgian team since 1949, at the initiative of Fernand De Visscher with the help of Franz De Ruyt, then mostly under the archaeological direction of Joseph Mertens from 1950 until 1991 (Anon, n.d.)(Campanelli, 2006)(Ruyt & Cl, 2006)(Strazzulla, 2006). In 2006/07, following an exhibition held at the Academia Belgica in Rome and in the Brussels Art & History Museum, the Italian archaeological authorities (Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici dell'Abruzzo) launched a new ambitious research program and generously invited Belgian archaeologists to join them. What began as a smallscale training excavation has become more and more professional, collaborating with specialists in various fields, from archaeozoologists to restorers, epigraphists and archaeo-speleologists. Pending the final publication, this essay will offer a 7. One should always dress like a marble column (Jackie Kennedy-Onassis) summary of some of our more significant discoveries. Our team from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (CReA -Patrimoine), together with the Royal Museums of Art and History, has been excavating and studying the southwestern zone of the forum for 10 campaigns since 2007. This part of the town had been partly scrutinised by Joseph Mertens in the 1950s-60s and by Jean Ch. Balty at the beginning of the 1960s, but large-scale excavations were impossible as the terrain was still in private hands. In the early 1950s, Mertens, in his attempt to understand the layout of the public square, dug a series of trenches in the forum (Fig. 7.1: 5). He later increased the number of trial trenches, including a long one (in 1971) that crossed the square from east to west (Anon, n.d.). Two small monuments, the 'tempietto' and a monumental base, were found in its central part (Anon, n.d.). The comitium stands to the north of the square, probably with the curia behind it (Mertens, 1968)(Anon, n.d.), map III.F, map IV), as in the contemporary colonies of Cosa and Paestum (Anon, n.d.). On the southern side, stands the basilica (Anon, n.d.), map II.L), a later addition, preceded by a portico (the diribitorium) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The square itself is 171.68 m long (with the porticoes), the paved platea c. 142 × 43.50 m (46.5 m according to (Anon, n.d.). It was supposedly flanked on both long sides by a row of tabernae along a portico opening on the 'Via del Miliario' (on the western side) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). But the long sides of the forum had not been systematically studied. Only one room, cut by a trench in 1960, was excavated by J. Ch. (Anon, n.d.) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). It opens onto the western portico of the forum, about 3.7 m wide, which runs along the 'Via del Miliario' (probably the extension of the via Valeria). Its dimensions (Anon, n.d.) are similar to the module used for the shops in the southern part of the town (5.10-5.50 × 9-12 m). These same measurements, it should be noted, were used for the shops surrounding the forum of the contemporary colony of Paestum, founded in 273 BC (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The presence at the back of the room of a platform with a column in Teos marble (marmo africano) supporting a white marble Corinthian capital (Anon, n.d.) suggests that it was a small sacellum, perhaps used by a collegium. The rich decoration of the interior, made up of opus sectile on the floor and marble panelling on the walls (crustae), seems to confirm this identification and certainly rules out the idea of a commercial space. These are located north of the last shops of the 'Via del Miliario', below a trial trench of the 1950s, and directly south of the Schola (Fig. 7.2). The aim was to ascertain if the regular colonial grid and rows of tabernae of the southern part of the town could be found around the forum, and to clarify the chronological sequence of the constructions. We excavated part of the upper terrace, and on the forum level, two rooms, the portico and part of the road (the continuation of the via Valeria) to the pavement of the square. On the upper terrace, a paved street runs parallel to the extension of the 'Via del Miliario' (Fig. 7.2: 8-9) (Anon, n.d.). It corresponds to the one identified during various surveys in the 1950s and named via Nova (Anon, n.d.). It measures c. 2.4 m in width -approximately 8 feet (for this module for secondary roads see (Anon, n.d.) -and its curbstones are still preserved. It continues behind the tabernae facing the diribitorium and joins the perpendicular 'Via dell'Elefante'. Its surface, free of any trace of car ruts on this section, is cambered for drainage, rainwater flowing through lateral openings into a storm drain. The terrace retaining wall is built in a superb polygonal masonry (Figs 7.2: 8; 7.3) (Anon, n.d.). Two series of square recesses, placed in a horizontal line, were carved at the back of the Columnar Hall. They may have served as sockets for the beams supporting a floor or for another kind of structure above the sewer. A quadrangular opening can be seen behind each room: the outlet of the culvert of the upper terrace. Only the southern diverticulum was used, as can be seen from the traces of wear and tear and the limescale deposits on the wall. The opening had been blocked by fragmentary architectural elements (a marble frieze, a column shaft). We excavated it over a length of 6 m. An ancient collapse prevented us from going any further. The bottom is covered with bipedales whose width corresponds exactly to that of the collector. The northern canal, on the other hand, stops at a short distance from the opening (60 cm). It had never been used, and its bottom has not been protected by ceramic tiles or covered with mortar. The rainwater flows into a large collector at the foot of the terrace, 1.7 m high and 0.8 m wide, also built in polygonal masonry (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.): on the left). It was strangely not recognised during Mertens' trial trenches of the forum or Balty's excavation of the Schola, although De Visscher identified it at the back of the tabernae A and B (Anon, n.d.). Most of the cover slabs had been taken away during Antiquity, with just the ones in continuation of the perpendicular walls of the original tabernae left in place. The fill was a treasure trove and presented, at the southern end, a wonderful section containing datable material -terra sigillata chiara, both African and imitations (c. AD 360-450) -in a destruction layer (Anon, n.d.). A double-faced official inscription in white marble, evidently coming from a public building, has been found at the bottom. The front side probably dates from the 1st century AD, the back to the 3rd century AD (Anon, n.d.); CIL IX 7933). A first room was discovered, directly south of the Schola, measuring 12.5 m deep (13.4 m to the terrace wall) and 11.4 m wide, i.e. double the usual module (Figs. 7.2: 5; 7.4) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The partition wall with the Schola, constructed in opus testaceum and opus incertum was found thrown to the ground by an earthquake. Only a few shreds are still standing on a base of large opus quadratum blocks. The opus testaceum is made of tiles cut in a triangle (Anon, n.d.). One of these bears the stamp CORD(VS), another the name Q. Naevius Hybrida, probably attesting to the fact that the factory (figlina) belonged to the family of Q. Naevius Cordus Sutorius Macro (21 BC -AD 38), the praetorian prefect of Tiberius and Caligula, originally from Alba, where he sponsored an important building activity (De Visscher 1957a; 1957b; PIR 2 , N12; Eck 2000). Several of these stamped tiles had been found in the earlier excavations (Buonocore, 1994)) and one, on a fragmentary terracotta pipe sadly out of context (in colluvial deposits), recently by the team from the University of Foggia that opened up an excavation right in front of us on the other long side of the Forum (Liberatore 2018). 7. One should always dress like a marble column (Jackie Kennedy-Onassis) Two rows of columns punctuated the internal space. There were originally at least three on each side (the southwestern base was despoiled during antiquity), placed very close to the walls (85 cm). The location of a fourth column can still be guessed at along the back wall. Only the plinth with the base, carved in one piece with the inferior part of the first drum of the columns (immoscapo), is preserved. The shafts, cable-fluted in their lower third, then fluted (20 flutes), rest on precisely carved Attic bases made of high-quality local limestone. They supported elegant Corinthianizing capitals with acanthus leaves in the style of the Forum of Augustus (Anon, n.d.). The overall height of these columns (including base and capital) must have approached 5.4 m (18 feet) (Anon, n.d.). Three smaller capitals indicate the existence of a higher order or, perhaps, of a baldachin-like structure at the back of the room, like in the Schola, or may have been reused during a late phase (other architectural parts were found in the collapse of the northern partition wall). Following a canonical Corinthian model, they are very close to mid-Augustan examples and to the capitals of the larger columns reused in the Alban San Pietro church (Anon, n.d.). The reworking of the southern bases, provided with large notches roughly carved with a pick, testifies to a partitioning in perishable material linked to a change of function of the room during a Late Antique phase (stables?). Two of the columns from the nave of the San Pietro church, placed at the entrance of the apse, carved in local limestone, are almost identical in their components (base with immoscapo, shaft) and size to the ones from the Columnar Hall, although bearing canonical Corinthian capitals. (Anon, n.d.) suggests that not all of the capitals of the room may have been Corinthianizing. The floor is covered with a plain white mosaic, made up of cuboid tesserae (height: 3 cm; width: 1 cm) embedded vertically in the laying mortar. This particular technique, known as a denti di cavallo ('horse's teeth'), is used when the soil is not very stable, either due to its sandy nature or, as it is probably the case here, to the presence of underground water. Numerous repairs and restorations are visible, made necessary by slow ground movements that have strongly deformed the floor. Even before the earthquake that put an end to its use, the room no longer seems to have been used. Underneath the collapsed wall, we found that it had been despoiled and abandoned for quite a long time: the columns were incomplete, one base had been stolen, the pavement was quite wavy. We found nothing except bones from butchered animals (dated by C14 analysis between AD 324-438 and 376-437). The fragments of the north wall still retained parts of their painted decoration. Large elongated rectangular panels with a red background decorated with marine animals (dolphin and ketos) alternate with small vertical panels with imitations of giallo antico plaques. The poor state of preservation makes stylistic analysis difficult. However, it is possible to propose a chronological range between the beginning of the 2nd and the end of the 3rd century AD. The square plan of the room, with the columns very close to the walls, evokes the Corinthian oecus of Vitruvius (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), as it is still visible in some houses of Pompeii, such as the House of Meleager (VI.9.2) or the House of the Labyrinth . This type of impressive construction, covered with a barrelvaulted ceiling, could be suitable as a reception hall, either municipal (for the civil or religious authorities) or for a collegium. This oecus was built after a complete reorganisation of the original colonial modular structure: the architects destroyed the old partition between the two tabernaeof which we found the foundations -and rebuilt the eastern limit of the sewer, originally in polygonal masonry, thinning it out to create a square internal space. The construction of a monumental entrance on the Forum portico, transforming its original design, enhanced even more the importance of this impressive room. 7. One should always dress like a marble column (Jackie Kennedy-Onassis) From the entrance onwards (where the threshold has been stripped in ancient times), the floor is paved, over a length of c. 6.4 m with a succession of three parallel rows of nine slabs of bardiglio nuvolato marble, each measuring 1.60 × 0.7 m. They are 3-4 cm thick and laid upon a bed of 15 cm of very hard pink mortar. Only one of them, at the entrance of the room, had been despoiled. Some piecing is apparent where the slabs were put in place with a crowbar: small triangular or trapezoidal pieces fill the gaps around the angles of some plaques. Several contiguous slabs present a kind of mirror image design: they were sawn from the same block and placed like the leaves of an open book. Two slabs on the southwestern side exhibit traces of a formidable impact, with radiating cracking, probably caused by the earthquake that destroyed the Columnar Hall. This kind of flooring is typical of imperial public buildings (Anon, 2001)(Anon, n.d.). Along the walls, a sloppy border, clearly a renovation, is formed by small tiles in bardiglio and pavonazzetto. Where the bardiglio pavement ends, a semicircular wall, razed to the ground, is visible. It originally formed an apse, as in the sanctuary of the Augustales of Misenum (Anon, 1991)(Anon, n.d.), and was also possibly provided with a bench along the wall. The apse was reinforced at the back by two retaining walls abutting on the sewer. The floor was paved, maybe in a later phase, with a rich opus sectile, laid on a rather powdery greyish mortar and composed of rectangular and square slabs of various marbles: giallo antico, pavonazzetto, alabastro listato, bardiglio, breccia corallina (?) and white marble. The apse was later demolished, the room enlarged, and the opus sectile extended and repaired, mainly using salvaged slabs, some still bearing fragmentary inscriptions. The materials used include white marble, bardiglio, alabaster, rosso antico, and pavonazzetto. The three walls of the room were lavishly decorated with marble veneer. Although the general structure of the revetment is coherent, one recognises quite a lot of disparate marble components. The lower part of the walls is covered with long slabs of bardiglio and cipollino to a height of about 27.5 cm. In some places, they are replaced by salvaged elements: white marble friezes, superimposed mouldings in pavonazzetto, or even an inlaid slab of rosso antico. They are topped by cornices in rosso antico and white marble, about 5.5 cm high and protruding by c. 1 cm. Some of these white marble mouldings still have remnants of red paint, testifying to the desire to imitate the Cap Tenaros marble. Above this cornice, and set back from the base, some fragments of alabastro fiorito plaques are still in place. They were framed by vertical bands of cipollino, c. 7.5 cm wide. Hundreds of marble fragments have been studied and recomposed to comprehend the original structure of the parietal decoration and its various repairs (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). At least four rosso antico capitals and their bases were recovered from the room, but also later pavonazzetto imitations. The parietal decoration loosely follows a structure attested in Herculaneum, in the oecus 18 of the House of the relief of Telephos (Anon, n.d.), but also on the forum of Cumae (Anon, n.d.). It can also be found on the façade of the three 'municipal buildings' on the small southern side of the forum of Pompeii (Anon, n.d.). It is, though, especially close to the one in the Alban Schola (Anon, n.d.). The room presents a different archaeological situation from its neighbour: after the earthquake, the rubble was removed and the room repaired and reused. We found it filled with a detrital layer dating from AD 380-430. The presence of an apse, razed to the ground in a later phase, as well as the lavish decoration of the floors and walls, suggest that this room may have served as a sacellum for a college, perhaps that of the seviri Augustales, of which there is so much epigraphic evidence in Alba Fucens (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). One should always dress like a marble column (Jackie (Anon, n.d.) No inscription or imperial image confirm this hypothesis, but many rooms with an apse and marble decoration on the floor and walls have been identified as seats of Augustales associations: we can mention the one in the southern area of the forum of Roselle (Anon, n.d.), those around the forum (northwestern and southeastern corners) and the ancient Piscina Publica of Paestum (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)2) and, especially, the one on the forum of Tibur (Anon, n.d.). Let us also remember that many collegia of the Republican period linked to a specific divinity, such as the Mercuriales of Paestum or the Herculanei of Tibur, were associated with the imperial cult from the Augustan period onwards (Anon, n.d.). The well Behind the apse, a well with a diameter of 1 m and a depth of 5 m was excavated in 2010 (Anon, n.d.). The water appeared at a depth of 1m. This anaerobic environment has allowed the preservation of a diverse and interesting organic material: wood, leather, sponge, fruit cores and shells, etc. The material, both ceramic and numismatic, indicates a date of the main filling at the time of the emperors Claudius or Nero; the upper part kept on being used until the 3rd century AD, when it was definitely closed. Both rooms opened onto a deep portico (equal to the width of each room), each circular column base -c. 130 cm in diameter (4.5 feet) -standing in front of the partition walls between the rooms (Fig. 7.2: 2-3) (Anon, n.d.). This system was reorganised when the oecus was constructed: the central column was taken away and replaced by a pair of (probably Corinthian) columns placed on a square plinth (side of 108 cm, with the trace of a 90 cm circular base on top), creating a monumental entrance. A short flight of stairs separated the higher colonnaded passage from the street (the continuation of the 'Via del Miliario'). It had been completely despoiled in front of the Marble Room but is still partly preserved further north. The street, c. 16 feet wide (double the via Nova), is paved and in fine condition, although its western edge has been torn away. It bears deep ruts, testifying to its use for carts, right next to the Forum square and in front of its side porticoes, which is surprising to say the least. One would indeed expect animal-driven vehicles to be banned from the forum, like in Pompei and so many other Roman towns. To the east, the curbstones towards the forum square have been preserved, but the paving of the latter has unfortunately been despoiled. This system of a colonnaded street is similar to the situation downtown (Anon, n.d.), although on a grandiose scale: if the intercolumniation is the same (complying with the modular system of the tabernae), the width of the walkway under the portico is double the size. Even the via Valeria is broader along the Forum. The importance of the public square, the centre of the town's political life, is thus effectively highlighted (see, already (Anon, n.d.). Strangely, no continuation of the 'Via dei Pilastri' was found on the eastern side of the square, nor by Mertens nor by the team of the Foggia University (Strazzulla et al., 2012), although traces of the portico still exist. The floor of the portico in front of the Marble Room is paved with an extremely worn white mosaic of a technique similar to that of the Columnar Hall. A simple geometrical pattern, made of black tesserae, acts as a kind of 'doormat' located at the boundary between the portico and the lower street area. Over time, both this motif and the rest of the mosaic carpet have undergone numerous alterations and restorations. It had been strengthened by a border of small stone slabs placed longitudinally in the continuation of the walls, effectively separating this space from the rest of the portico, that probably fell into disuse after the destruction of the Columnar Hall. Lying on the portico mosaic in front of the Marble Room, we found a layer of destruction with the remains of two structures: to the south, a vertical construction in opus testaceum, perhaps a statue base, and to the north a mass of white plaster on which inscriptions were painted in rustic capitals. After a thorough excavation and the discovery of a fragment mentioning the Calends of May, we realised that it was the remains of a large calendar, painted on stucco, that must have originally covered an area of no less than 10 m 2 (Fig. 7.7). The hundreds of fragments were laying directly on the mosaic in a heap, in no apparent order -except for one large plaque. Their rear side shows the imprints of bricks, traces of the wall that supported it. 7. One should always dress like a marble column (Jackie Kennedy-Onassis) The calendar was thus stripped off a wall -probably to reuse its bricks -and thrown away on the portico. A second layer of white stucco, extremely thin (less than 1 cm thick) and badly preserved, with some rare traces of engraved letters, still covered some fragments. The whole surface of the original calendar bears pick marks made to facilitate the adhesion of the upper layer of stucco. This second phase has helped save some of the painted letters from decay, allowing us to carry out a painstaking work of cleaning, consolidating, gluing, photographing, drawing, and reconstructing the structure. Cesare Letta and Patrick Tansey have been deciphering and interpreting the whole document (Letta, 2013)(Anon, n.d.)(Evers & Massar, 2014)(Anon, n.d.), with a final publication due in 2025. Most of the document consists of a post-Julian calendar, with the 12 columns of the months. Underneath this, a strip contains the names of the dedicators (magistrates), followed by columns listing the pairs of consuls of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Empire (Fasti Consulares). The whole text (412 × 232 cm), written in red letters on white stucco, is framed by a large border in green paint. We cannot be sure of its original location, as it was found in a secondary context. Although one might be tempted to place it under the forum portico, on the facade wall of the Marble Room, two arguments contradict this: the room was probably never closed by a brick wall and the opening would have been too narrow, not allowing the space for a door. The fragility of the stucco and painting (a secco) must also be stressed: it had to have been placed in an enclosed space. The Columnar Hall, although further from the discovery spot of the Fasti, presents similar problems: it looks as if it had never been closed by a solid wall, and the calendar would have been difficult to read behind the columns. The only place where it can have been exhibited, close to where it was dumped, is the northern wall of the Marble Room, above the veneer plinth. This emphasizes once more the official character of this space. The forum of the colony, indispensable for its functioning as a town, must have been planned at the very beginning. The structuring of the valley had to be dealt with first. The retaining walls of the terraces (those identified in the 1950s and the one presented here) as well as the sewer, in polygonal masonry, which shape the slopes around the forum square, testify to one of the earliest urbanisation phases of the town, still in the 3rd century BC, with adaptations during the 2nd century BC. The structuring of the adjoining regular modules is contemporary, as we can deduct from the discovery of the base of the original partition wall, constructed in polygonal masonry, in the middle of the Columnar Hall, underneath its mosaic. The same division in modules is still visible on the terrace wall, with recesses dug out at two different levelscorresponding to the two original rooms. The culverts were also already planned in the construction of the terrace walls, even if not all of them were finally used. It is more difficult to define a function for these rooms during this first phase. They were probably initially simple shops, as Bollmann had proposed in a very theoretical way in her study on the Roman scholae (Anon, n.d.) following in any case the 'colonial' module also used in Paestum (about 5.5 × 11 m). The commercial function would later be relegated to the lower part of the town. The presence of the well at the bottom of the Marble Room, an essential element found in all the shops of Alba south of the basilica, provides the only trace of this first use. We have until now no real chronological data for the construction of the forum portico. We can probably follow Mertens' proposal of a 2nd-1st centuries BC Hellenistic style upgrading of the town, attested for the construction of the basilica and the renovation of the Herculean complex, but no architectural element of the columns is preserved (except a base with fluted drum on the eastern side, in front of the taberna III, if in place (Anon, n.d.)). The only assurance we have is that the building of the entrance of the Columnar Hall replaced the original rhythm of the colonnade. Mertens recognised a monumental transformation of Alba at the end of the Republic. Our research has particularly highlighted this phenomenon. The Columnar Hall underwent a major restructuring: initially formed by two units of colonial module, it was unified by destroying the partition wall, and a Corinthian oecus was built, a hall whose square proportions were obtained by moving the back wall of the hall (eastern wall of the sewer) backwards (the polygonal wall was destroyed and replaced by a thinner one). A white mosaic was then laid on the floor, and probably on the whole length of the portico in front of the three rooms. It has only been preserved in front of the Marble Room (with a reinforcing border), the unit that had the longer life during the Late Empire. A monumental entrance -with two Corinthian columnswas built as an entrance to the Columnar Hall, removing the column that faced the partition wall of the two original spaces. The recent study by Patrizio Pensabene has shown that the Attic column bases date from a model created just after the second triumvirate. Indeed, if we read the ancient sources -Appian (Sam. 45.1, 47.1) and (Anon, n.d.)) in particular -we do realise how closely the future Augustus was linked to Alba. As soon as he returned from Epirus with the news of Caesar's death, Octavian took on Mark Antony and sought to hire soldiers. It was at this point, in 44 BC, that the First Martian Legion defected from Mark Antony and rallied to the young Caesar, moving to Alba Fucens. And it is there that they confronted the forces of Mark Antony who had rushed there to bring them back to order and had to return to Rome empty-handed. Octavian joined them in Alba, with the rest of his troops (almost five legions by then), and wrote to the Senate, who congratulated him. This position of strength prevented Antony from having him designated hostis publicus. Augustus will no doubt have never forgotten the loyalty of the Albenses. The town already had a special link with Caesar, who was patron of the municipium (De & Visscher, 1964) and, if we do not yet have an inscription linking Augustus directly to 7. One should always dress like a marble column (Jackie Kennedy-Onassis) the town, we do have one dedicated to his grandson Lucius Caesar as patron of the colony (Anon, n.d.)). These three rooms on the western side of the forum, along the via Valeria and close to the basilica and the diribitorium, had, in my opinion, official or semi-official functions from the end of the Republic onwards. The Marble Room has a similar plan to that of the Schola, with almost identical dimensions and a very similar floor and wall layout. The rich decoration is not suitable for a shop. The materials used, such as rosso antico, giallo antico and pavonazzetto, were some of the most expensive marbles of the Empire. The dais at the back of one room and the apse in the other indicate their use as a sacellum, although it is not possible to identify the deities honoured. The very structure of the three rooms, with no counter or back room, does not show any indication of a commercial function. On the contrary, both their layout and their location make them particularly suitable for public or semi-public functions, probably related to colleges. The incredible richness of the decoration of the Marble Hall and the Schola, the presence of a floor made of large slabs of bardiglio, the remains of an official inscription and, above all, the presence of the town's calendar, bear ample witness to this. Like in so many Italian cities, the Augustan Age was a turning point in their urbanism. The commercial functions of the tabernae were probably banned from the Forum area and relegated to the south. The Schola became a small sacellum, and the Columnar Hall was built, maybe as an official banqueting hall for the town's magistrates or for a collegium (Augustales?). The Marble Hall may have functioned as an Augusteum and was the repository of the official calendar of the town. The rooms were even more embellished during the Claudio-Neronian epoch, with a lavish display of marble veneer. The testament of Macro and the draining of the Fucine lake had brought new wealth. After the Julio-Claudian period, the rooms continued to be used and restored. A major restructuring of the Marble Hall, during which the apse was razed to the ground and a new opus sectile laid, took place at a still undetermined period (possibly in the 3rd century AD, if an inscription and a series of coins can be linked to this event). The walls of the Columnar Hall were also redecorated in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. Its floor gradually deteriorated though, and it lost its representative function to become a stable, and maybe a butcher shop (rests of slaughtered animals dating from the c. AD 400). After an earthquake that put an end to the town's prosperity, it was despoiled and abandoned, while the Marble Room was cleared and restored. It too finally fell into disuse, its marble veneer slowly falling on the floor, before being recovered by a detrital fill dating from c. AD 380-430, then by the thick layer of colluvium that covered the whole town during the early Middle Ages and forced the inhabitants to seek higher ground (Galadini et al., 2012). The only ancient structure with no archaeological layer on top is the via Valeria, that continued to be used for several centuries after the abandonment of the forum. Subsequently, the research extended to include earlier Etruscan centres including Vulci (Sabatini et al., 2021), Acquarossa and Spina (Kay et al., 2020)). On the left bank of the River Tiber, centres were investigated in the Sabina (Forum Novum) as well as in the Abruzzo, with an extensive survey of Iuvanum and smaller-scale investigations of Peltuinum (Hay, 2015) and Alba Fucens (Hay, 2014). The surveys used a variety of nondestructive techniques, principally geophysical prospection, as a means to examine and develop an understanding of a wide range of urban sites, aiming to investigate and challenge some of the traditional models of ancient urban planning. The fieldwork at Lucus Feroniae was undertaken over the course of three seasons (June 2013, May 2015, and March 2017), comprising an extensive magnetometry survey of areas within the modern archaeological park and immediately to its south and west (Fig. 8.1). These results were then used to direct more detailed Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys, initially with two test areas within the modern park and subsequently a large area to the south. Situated within the modern-day Provincia di Roma, approximately 28 km to the north of Rome, the town of Lucus Feroniae falls within the ager Capenas. The site was first discovered in 1953 and subsequently investigated by the Soprintendenza Archeologia, Belle Arti e Paesaggio per l'area metropolitana di Roma, la Provincia di Viterbo e l'Etruria Meridionale. The site lies in an open area which gradually slopes east towards 8. From sanctuary to settlement the Tiber flood plain and the river beyond. A series of hills rise to the northwest (Mt S. Lorenzo, Mt Ruzzola, Mt Belvedere), with access to the north limited by a complex of ridges that lie beyond modern day Fiano Romano (Anon, n.d.). Approximately 8 km to its north runs the Fosso Pantanelle, flowing from the base of Mt Belvedere southeastwards onto the Tiber flood plain, and to the south flows the Fosso di Gramiccia. The town itself lies at an important intersection between the 'Via Capenate' and 'Via Tiberina'. Today a large portion of the land surrounding the site is agricultural, with most of those areas surveyed now open grassland, although to the east much was lost during the construction of the Autostrada del Sole. Lucus Feroniae has a deep but interrupted history (Anon, 2016)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The discovery of the earliest cremation necropolis in southern Etruria, with 12 individuals for the 13th and 12th centuries BC, raises important questions about the way this site operated in the economy of the late Bronze Age (Trucco et al., 2014)(Anon, n.d.), and the extent to which any notion of the importance of the site may have survived into the next phase of activity which is visible in the archaeological record, from the 6th to 4th centuries BC. Unfortunately, all this material is found in disturbed contexts, so detail is missing. Small fragments of architectural terracottas suggest the possibility of the built environment. Standard and miniature pottery, especially relating to food and perfume, including imports from western Greece, Attica and Etruria, terracotta figures, and bronze figurines from northern and southern Etruria, Umbria, and Latium, all suggest a sanctuary site, and one which attracted worshippers from some distance, or at the least, attracted those who had the capacity to acquire goods from a distance. The bronzes included a deer, a haruspex, a warrior, individuals in the pose of offering, and kouros and kore figures. There were also personal ornaments including ones produced as far afield as the Balkans and Near East. Similar finds have been made in Falerii Veteres. There are numerous connections also with the Abruzzo and Adriatic coast (Anon, n.d.). Both architectural and votive evidence, again scattered, shows an increase in activity in the 3rd century BC. It would appear that the sanctuary was significantly wealthy (see (Anon, n.d.)). This may have attracted one of the most famous incidents in the history of the sanctuary, a sack by Hannibal's troops in 211 BC. tells us that the sanctuary contained much gold and silver, dedicated by the people of nearby Capena and surrounding peoples, who offered their firstfruits. The importance of the sanctuary is also indicated in a passage of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Anon, n.d.). Although perhaps anachronistically placed in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, Dionysius claims that the sanctuary was a meeting point for Romans and Sabines, that it gathered merchants, artisans and farmers, and its fairs were the most celebrated in Italy. Epigraphical attestations also survive on bases of dedications, and it seems clear that pottery (especially vernice nera) was being produced on the site for dedication and export, as well as arriving from further afield. Also visible on site is coinage, especially from Campania, along with rings and seals, some dating back to early phases of the site (Anon, n.d.). The sack was highly profitable, but seems to have elicited some religious concerns. Livy (13.83-91) says that out of religious concern, the soldiers left heaps of bronze behind; Silius Italicus (Pun. 13.81-93) reports that Hannibal forced the soldiers to despoil the site (the story was clearly told by Coelius Antipater: FRHist 15 F25). A bronze brocca, found in a tomb in Capena, dedicated to Numisius Martius, has been thought to be an example of such abandoned booty (Ferrante, 2008). As an omen of the following year showed, the sanctuary cannot have been totally destroyed, since Livy (27.4.14-15) reports the portent of statues sweating blood. Early 2nd-century BC architectural terracottas provide evidence for the rebuilding or restoration of the temple, which was struck by lightning in 196 BC (Anon, n.d.). It is likely that much of the archaic structure of the site disappeared in a major restructuring in the 2nd century BC, which created a substantial area of regular building not far from the temple. Local stone was used in opus incertum. Who was living here? Food containers with inscribed individual names, all male, might suggest cult personnel, but this phase remains obscure (Anon, n.d.). Later in the 2nd century BC, Lucus Feroniae experienced another substantial transformative moment, with a major reconstruction which was funded by one Cnaeus Egnatius, who left a major inscription on the site, probably relating to the repaving of the area. This reconstruction produced a new temple on a substantial podium with an octastyle portico in the Corinthian order. This sits within a large piazza of three actus in size (3/8 of a hectare), which is set within the road network around the site, notably the via Campana, which also passes through the grove of Dea Dia (Scheid, 1976). The Egnatius who was the dedicator of this complex was styled praetor, and it is possible to identify him with Cn. Egnatius praetor in the mid-140s BC, who served in Macedonia, and was a signatory to a senatus consultum relating to Corcyra (SEG III 451). That inscription tells us that he belonged to the Stellatina tribe, which included nearby Capena (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). However, the Egnatian complex appears to have been left unfinished and possibly spoliated, perhaps in the course of the battles between Marius and Sulla. A colony was placed here and has been most recently dated by Stanco to the early 1st century BC, although its name, Colonia Julia Felix Lucoferensis shows it also received a veteran colony of the triumviral period (Anon, n.d.). Nearby centuriation will be associated with one or other phase of this colonial settlement. Its first magistrates may have been the duoviri quinquennales C. Didius and M. Vettius, whose inscription is found on a reused votive base (Anon, n.d.). In architectural terms we see a new forum, a sacellum of Salus Frugifera, and a basilica, which may have used columns from the temple of Feronia. The Egnatian family's commitment to the sanctuary, whether or not this relates to an early 1st century BC putative colony, may also have been commemorated in coinage from 75 BC by C. Egnatius Maximus. Crawford identified a female figure on the coins as Libertas with a pileus, but the recent interpretation would favour Feronia, who does appear, but named, on early Augustan coins by the low-born Turpilianus (Anon, n.d.); on Turpilianus see (Anon, n.d.). The Egnatii survived the Sullan period, but were destroyed in Octavian's proscriptions, and it is very likely that at this stage the nearby villa passed from this family to the Volusii. Marzano suggests that one of the main operations of the Volusii may have been the production of lime, and a large lime production area was indeed found just 1 km away (Anon, 2007). Another aspect of the economy of the site is the port at Baciletti, probably the portus Curensis, which offered a connection to the Tiber. That the triumviral or post-Actium colony provoked controversy is evident from a passage in the writings of the Roman land surveyors, where Julius Frontinus notes flaws in the maps (Lib. Colon. T 37-38). The Augustan period sees another restructuring of the area, with a new pavement, walkways, honorific statues, a small temple of Salus, and a sacellum to the Genius Coloniae. The Egnatian inscription is covered over. (Anon, n.d.) notes the decline in inscriptions to Feronia, and suggests that the cult was in terminal decline, replaced by Salus Frugifera and the imperial cult. Interestingly, the road system remains core to the urban layout. A dam and aqueduct ensured the supply of water. After the death of Augustus, the Volusii marked their gratitude with a temple to the Divus Augustus on the site of the building which had possibly been the basilica. Their own villa was intimately connected to the larger site, but it was not the only one in the area, and all were clearly productive, starting in the later 2nd century BC, and renovated around the time of Actium (Anon, 2016); doubts over the hypothesis of an ergastulum at the Villa of the Volusii have been raised by (Anon, n.d.). The complicated imperial history of the site sees various interventions, for instance under Caligula and Trajan, which can be traced in the significant remains of sculpture, largely of the imperial family. The site acquires two sets of baths which continue into Late Antiquity, and a Trajanic-Hadrianic amphitheatre. In the 3rd century AD, two ornamental entrances are created for ludi iuvenum Romanorum Lucoferoniensium (Anon, n.d.)). These games included ones associated with the birthday of Rome, 21 April. However, the inhabited area of the town which had flourished between the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, with some impressive mosaics and the enrichment of significant villas around the site, including the Villa of the Volusii, begins to decline, possibly as agricultural production is concentrated in the imperially owned Fundus Flavianus (Anon, 2016). Restorations are scarce, and the area is gradually abandoned between the 4th and 6th centuries AD, although there was a short-lived Christian community there, who may have repurposed public buildings as churches, with nearby tombs. No bishopric was ever founded, and the community seems to have moved to the nearby Castellum Scoranum (Anon, 1992). Varro clearly attributes Feronia to a group of Sabine deities (Anon, n.d.)(Fazio, 2012)(Anon, n.d.). Schulze insisted on the Etruscan aspect of the cult, but this was part of his over-emphasis on the Etruscans throughout (Anon, 1904)). However, it was also an ancient idea; Cato the Elder (FRHist 5 F69) claimed the cult was founded by young men sent to Capena from Veii (even though his name, Propertius, is Umbrian). In fact, the cult is widely spread across a wide swathe of central Italy up to the head of the Adriatic in one direction and across to Sardinia in the other. Feronia was also celebrated in the Campus Martius at Rome, where she was adopted by the later 3rd century BC (even though the cult of Feronia may have been 'evoked', some effective doubts have been raised by (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Her cult outside Rome is said to be as old as the Roman kings, but certainly continues well into the empire. Her characteristics are highly varied. She is often found paired with a male deity, and it is possible we see a divine couple, Jupiter Feretrius and Juno Feronia. At some point, Feronia is associated with slaves and freedom -slaves were set free in her shrine near (Anon, n.d.). This has led to the identification of female figures with the pileus as Feronia, critically on coinage (par. 8.2). Aside from these considerations, it appears that Feronia tended to be worshipped in groves and associated with sanctuaries with wide audiences. If this is correct, we can think about the possibility of Feronia having roles related to commerce and boundaries, at any rate, to general principles which allow this divinity to be assimilated to cults across the marketplaces of Italy. At this point the argument becomes somewhat speculative and theological. For our purposes the most significant issue perhaps is to ask what kind of settlement Lucus Feroniae was. Its function as a meeting place, and the accumulation of wealth in the sanctuary seems directly related to the worship of Feronia, though we perhaps should see this as a symbiotic relationship. We cannot trace elite appropriation of the sanctuary before the Egnatian phase in the later 2nd century BC, but from this point onwards, the singular importance of Feronia to the site seems to be at least diluted and possibly in rapid decline. Conversely, the space becomes open for other display, both religious and secular. The role of Lucus Feroniae as a centre for games associated closely with Rome may be taken to track deeper shifts in the expression of how a node of interaction might work. Over the course of the three field seasons, magnetometry and GPR survey were carried out covering those areas accessible both within the archaeological park and directly surrounding it to the south and southwest. A local grid system was established using a Total Station and GPS, delineating a series of 30 × 30 m grids orientated at an approximate 45° angle to the excavated structures. The magnetometry survey was conducted using two Bartington Grad601 dual probe fluxgate gradiometers, with data collected at a sample interval of 0.25 m along 0.5 m traverse intervals. A GPS was used to record local topography and to accurately map the excavated roads and structures. The GPR survey was used to target areas where the results of the magnetometry were either unclear or where they suggested a deeper, more complex stratigraphy. It was undertaken using a GSSI SIR 3000 with a single channel 400 MHz antenna, with data collected at traverse intervals of 0.25 m. Two small test areas within the archaeological park were initially surveyed followed by a larger area outside of the park to the south, covering approximately 1 ha. The magnetometry survey at Lucus Feroniae covered an area of 12.5 ha (Fig. 8.2). The features are described by area (Fig. 8.1) in the section below, as a range of subsurface anomalies were recorded across the study area. Situated along the eastern limits of the modern archaeological park, directly to the east of the forum and the 'Via Tiberina', Area 1 covered approximately one fifth of the total area surveyed (Fig. 8.1). Despite several areas of localised magnetic disturbance to the north and east, the results of the magnetometry were generally clear, with a series of archaeological features identified across the area (Fig. 8.2). Starting in the north of Area 1, of particular interest are two groups of strong, parallel positive anomalies within fairly distinct regions, each displaying a series of regular and evenly distributed circular positive anomalies between them. The first area, situated directly to the east of the 'Via Tiberina' and appearing to respect the northern limits of the sanctuary, contains a series of 15 positive linear anomalies running approximately northeast-southwest (Fig. 8.3: 1). Each of these anomalies is approximately 0.9 m in width, occurring at regular intervals of c. 5 m. Given their signal strength and nature, these anomalies almost certainly represent filled cuts in the underlying shallow bedrock. The circular positive anomalies, measuring approximately 1 m in diameter and occurring at regular intervals of c. 6 m between these linear features, probably also represent cuts in the bedrock. The second region, separated from the first by an area of c. 5 m devoid of features (possibly a trackway), has a similar arrangement of linear and circular positive anomalies. The linear features, orientated northwest-southeast and at intervals of approximately 2.7 m, measure c. 0.6 m in width. The positive circular anomalies measuring approximately 0.8 m in diameter and occurring at intervals of c. 1.5 m between these linear anomalies, may again represent filled circular cuts. A possible interpretation for the series of trenches and pits visible in the data across these two regions is agricultural activity. In terms of chronology, it would appear that the features respect a large rectilinear feature directly to the south and west. Measuring approximately 23 × 127 m and running parallel to the forum, this feature perhaps represents a part of the sanctuary. Similarly, to the south of these, two parallel linear anomalies (Fig. 8.3: 2) have a north-south alignment and are associated with an area of magnetic disturbance. From a study of archival photographs and documentation, these appear to relate to a pathway or railway line installed during the 20th century excavations at the site, leading to a spoil heap. At the southern end of this feature, a cistern, also recorded during 20th-century excavations, is visible in the results (Anon, n.d.), possibly connected to a wider network of water channels which extends to the north and west. A series of structures were recorded immediately to the east of the temple and altar, even though the disturbance from the excavations and the dumping of spoil has masked some of the features (a fence around the area prevented the extension of the survey). Finally, at the very southern extent of the survey, the magnetometry recorded a series of buildings clustered around the southeast corner of the forum (Fig. 8.3: 4). Situated to the north of the 'Via Capenate' the area comprises approximately 3 ha and lies between the northern edge of the modern archaeological park and the partially excavated road (Figs 8.1 and 8.2). The continuation of the 'Via Capenate' is clearly visible running east-west across the western part of the survey area (Fig. (Anon, n.d.), continuing beyond the archaeological park as evidenced by aerial photographs of the site. As in Area 1, an area of probable agricultural activity can be identified, taking the form of a series of parallel positive linear anomalies likely again representing trenches dug into the bedrock (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Of particular interest in relation to these areas of agricultural activity are a series of possible cisterns located across Area 2 (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Several features appear to be directly connected to a series of negative linear anomalies radiating outwards at approximate right angles to the features, similar to those seen in Area 1. It is possible that these anomalies relate to an irrigation system linked to the agricultural activity, although since they appear to cut across the area of cultivation activity this may indicate that they post-date the agricultural trenches. The majority of this area appears devoid of any distinct structures, with just a grouping of features at the junction of the 'Via Capenate' and 'Via Tiberina', close to the Augusteum. The final anomaly of interest (Fig. 8.3: 8) is recorded as a strong, rectangular positive anomaly. It may represent a cistern or a large solid foundation; the internal area has a lower magnetic field at the centre, perhaps indicating a change in construction material. Situated to the south of the 'Via Capenate' between the forum and the southern and southwestern limits of the archaeological park, Area 3 constitutes approximately 25% of the total area surveyed. The results in Area 3 display a higher degree of disturbance caused by modern activity -most notably to the south of the 'Capenate baths' and to the west of the amphitheatre, most likely related to spoil from excavations. Multiple 8. From sanctuary to settlement dipolar striations are also visible running approximately northwest-southeast across this area, again most likely linked to modern agricultural activity at the site. The most significant features in the results from this area are the predominantly negative linear anomalies identified in the eastern part of Area 3. Extending south from the 'Via Capenate' is a strong double negative anomaly (Fig. 8.3: 9), probably walls, which appear to delineate a series of divided open spaces backing onto an area of intense building activity identified in the magnetometry results flanking the 'Via Tiberina'. Within this area of activity, various positive and negative linear anomalies have been identified, probably representing the continuation of domestic structures that radiate out from the forum. Of particular interest are two dipolar anomalies in two of these open spaces, similar in form and signal strength to kilns. It may also be possible, therefore, that these open spaces were used for production. The southeastern corner of Area 3 was less affected by modern activity at the site and is dominated by a large rectilinear structure (Fig. 8.3: 10) measuring approximately 22 × 12m. The structures appear to continue beyond the eastern limit of the survey expanding outwards from the forum area. Area 4 covers approximately one quarter of the total area surveyed. Large parts of this area were inaccessible during data collection due to thick vegetation and high levels of surface water. There was also a substantial quantity of modern interference in this area, relating to abandoned construction work, archaeological excavations, and refuse disposal. The central section of Area 4 contains a wealth of previously unknown archaeological features, revealing the continuation of the 'Via Tiberina' (Fig. (Anon, n.d.) and a further two possible roads branching off the 'Via Tiberina'. A large number of rectilinear features are visible along both roadsides, and given their form most likely represent domestic structures, suggesting a reasonably dense occupation through the central part of this area. In general, the strong negative linear anomalies appear to represent walls whilst the positive anomalies within the groups of these negative linear features may represent floor surfaces or accumulation of fired material such as roof tiles. From an interpretation of the anomalies, it is possible to identify a number of potential separate structures which extend away from the central road. Several groups of individual rooms are identifiable through a number of interconnecting features (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Of further interest, however, are a series of four, parallel, negative linear anomalies to the east of the 'Via Tiberina', measuring 11 to 29 m in length and orientated approximately northwest-southeast. The appearance of these anomalies and the relatively quiet nature of the open areas between them, are similar to the anomalies identified in the eastern part of Area 3. It is possible, therefore, that these linear features represent similar dividing structures designed to demarcate individual open spaces such as gardens, courtyards or areas utilised for some form of production. Following the initial magnetometry survey in 2013, two small test areas of targeted GPR survey were conducted within the park in 2015 to compare with the results of the magnetometry as well as to apply GPR in an area where there was significant magnetic disturbance. The technique offers an increased resolution, as well as being less affected by ambient noise, and the possibility to assess anomalies at a range of depths. The data were collected in a regular series of parallel traverses at a distance of 0.25 m with varying lengths. The test grids provided useful additional detail to the magnetometry, in particular in the area towards the forum where had been deposited from previous excavations. The magnetometry survey immediately to the south of the archaeological park indicated a dense occupation alongside the 'Via Tiberina' leading south from the forum. Following the tests within the park, a central area of 143 × 60 m was therefore investigated with GPR. The results indicate a complex range of interlocking features that appear to define elements of an urban settlement focused around an area approximately 80 m wide that runs in a northeast-southwest direction. The results of the GPR survey indicate an approximate depth of features ranging 0.3 to 1 m, after which there is the underlying bedrock. The majority of the high amplitude anomalies indicate brick or stone-built walls that suggest a substantial level of preservation. In a central area, a feature in the magnetometry results is shown in greater clarity and linearity (Fig. 8.4: 1), suggesting a square form, perhaps a central courtyard with a number of regular adjacent rooms. Of particular interest are five long parallel features (Fig. 8.4: 2) aligned in a southeast direction away from the central concentration of features. These also coincided with features recorded by the magnetometry. The regularity and amplitude of these features suggests a solid construction, even though the features do not appear to join to the east. It is possible that these are some form of land division as noted elsewhere in the hinterland of Lucus Feroniae (Anon, n.d.). Other regular features were recorded by the GPR in the central eastern area indicating an orientation along a secondary road leading to the northwest (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). The GPR anomalies that are described are in the central part of the survey area with relatively few features recorded either to the east or west, suggesting a concentration alongside the central road that traverses the survey area. The combined geophysical surveys at Lucus Feroniae have revealed previously unknown large parts of the site, tracing a settlement that appears to stretch along the principal throughfares and which is centred around the sanctuary and forum. An element of particular interest are the regularly spaced anomalies (Fig. 8.3: 1) to the immediate north of the excavated temple and altar. The proximity to the sacred area and the lack of construction, especially in an area close to the 'Via Tiberina', are perhaps indicators that the area was respected in antiquity. The form of the geophysical anomalies has parallels with agricultural activity, with the long features potentially filled trenches and the circular cuts filled pits suggesting the possibility of vine trenches and tree holes. This hypothesis is supported by nearby excavations on the 'Via Tiberina' (at km 19.5), where, together with 10 burials, 21 pits and 9 channels were identified, interpreted as pits for fruit trees and channels for irrigation (Fazio et al., 2013). The distribution of these anomalies has very strong similarities with those of vine trenches. To the southeast of Rome, in the area of Tor Pagnotta, a large number of parallel trenches were excavated on the same northeast-southwest alignment, measuring 0.7-0.8 m in width and at distance of 3.7 m (Santangeli et al., 1980). The features at Lucus Feroniae are similar in width (approximately 0.9 m) with a row separation of 5 m, still, however, greater than that indicated by Columella (De arboribus 4.3). There are few parallels with magnetometry surveys of these forms of features in central Italy, even though one example from nearby Musarna (Viterbo) recorded channels 0.85-0.95 m in width and at an average spacing of 6.6 m (Broise & Jolivet, 1995). Whilst the width and spacing of the anomalies would appear to fit the hypothesis of a vineyard, these are also interspersed with regular circular features, interpreted as pits, measuring approximately 1 m. A hypothesis is that these are pits for trees cut into the bedrock, as recorded elsewhere near Lucus Feroniae (Anon, n.d.). The spacing of these in a vineyard may reflect the use of interplanted cultivation with the planting of fruit trees or the arbustum technique where vines are intercropped with other plants and encouraged to climb tress (Anon, n.d.). One argument against the possible interpretation of this as a vineyard is that this area on the right bank of the Tiber was less suitable for the cultivation of vines (Anon, n.d.), even though this may also reflect patterns of modern urban development and these features being recognised in the archaeological record. A further aspect to consider regarding these geophysical anomalies is the proximity to the sanctuary of Lucus Feroniae. As noted above, Feronia tends to be associated with sacred woodlands and, indeed, trees had a sacred character in ancient Italic religions (Anon, 1987). The interpretation as these features forming part of a sacred woodland around the sanctuary has been put forward by Del Lungo (2019), interpreting these geophysical features as part of a woodland around the temple. A parallel can be drawn with the lucus identified at the sanctuary of Jupiter at Gabii. Excavations around the temple identified 70 pits measuring 1.2 to 1.3 m (compared with 1 m at Lucus Feroniae). These have been interpreted as pits for fruit trees that formed a sacred woodland, whereas the templum was considered a free area in the centre of the woodland itself (Anon, 1987). The settlement of Lucus Feroniae went through several phases of restructuring and urban development over the course of its history. From the initial foundation of the sanctuary in the 6th century BC (Anon, n.d.) archaeological evidence attests major rebuilding in the 2nd century BC, as well as other interventions such as the repaving paid by Cnaeus Egnatius (par. 8.2). Following its designation to colony status in the early 1st century BC, further transformation is recorded in the Augustan period as well as later in the Trajanic-Hadrianic period (such as the amphitheatre), and even later with the construction of a bath complex in the Late Antique period. Whilst many of these phases may be recorded in the geophysical survey, these can only be untangled through excavation. However, it is clear that the settlement had a change, perhaps in the 1st century BC, shifting from the site of a sanctuary to the role of small town, a change tied to the worship of Feronia. However, despite this transition, the settlement appears to have maintained its original concentration along the two principal roads and, on the basis of the visible archaeological record and geophysics, appears to be dominated by public buildings with less private space, a phenomenon of small towns seen elsewhere in central Italy (for example Forum Novum, Amiternum, Iuvanum). From its origins as an Italic sanctuary, Lucus Feroniae appears to have later taken on the role of administrative centre with public buildings grouped around the forum and which served the needs of a dispersed population in the immediate hinterland. The geophysical survey results appear to indicate that the settlement was less dense beyond the excavated baths to the west along the 'Via Capenate'. Furthermore, previous field walking to the west also confirmed a lack of pottery scatters (Anon, n.d.). However, several villas have been recorded in its immediate hinterland, one of which (Volusii Saturnini), built around 50 BC, appears to have belonged to Q. Volusius who, as previously noted, financed a temple to the Divus Augustus (Anon, n.d.). It would seem apparent therefore, at least by the early Imperial period, that the role of Lucus Feroniae had changed, as it served an economy centred around agricultural production with a small population living within the actual town. Septempeda: integrated approaches for revealing a 'small town' in Picenum Frank Vermeulen Scholarly research of the past two decades has convincingly demonstrated that a substantial majority of towns in Roman Italy, with their roots in the mid-or late Republican period, probably measured less than 20 ha, and can thus be described as 'small towns'. While there was some urban growth in the Imperial period, these basic parameters of urbanism did not fundamentally change: most urban settlements in Roman Italy remained relatively small (de Ligt 2012; Flohr 2021, 40; broader discussion of this phenomenon in Sewell 2016; de Ligt and Bintliff 2019; Vermeulen 2023). Although criteria guiding the recognition or bestowal of 'town status' differ from period to period and from region to region, however small, the settlements considered here are, they functioned in principle during at least one period of their existence as urban entities with a form of civic autonomy. In terms of physical appearance some of the elements that should or could be present for a settlement to belong to this category, whatever its size, are: a defended urban core, an internal street network, distinctive functional zones, a range of building types (both private and public), elite housing, a range of workshops and some craft industry, forms of monumentality, various types of epigraphy, and large organised cemeteries. It is perhaps not recommended to propose a strict minimum size, as in most cases the archaeological record does not permit a reliable estimate of their exact size in a given period of time, nor of the number of houses which existed simultaneously during their heyday. Nevertheless, much enhanced topographical research on ancient urban centres with some form of continuity of life, as well as increasing use of modern techniques of urban survey on partly or fully abandoned town sites, are starting to be convincing regarding town size estimates and the full deciphering of the physical constituents of Roman cities. Especially greenfield sites, where the ancient Roman population had partly or often completely abandoned their original urban area to 9. Septempeda: integrated approaches for revealing a 'small town' in Picenum move to more secure locations elsewhere, have in recent years demonstrated to be very suited to a more holistic approach to ancient urbanism. The general refinement of landscape-based strategies, widely employing techniques such as geophysical prospections, aerial photography, remote sensing, and GIS-based topographic analysis, allows now the fine-grained cartography required to bring out the necessary details of full urban layouts of Roman towns in Italy (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2012)(Anon, n.d.). The wide variety of regional trajectories visible in the urbanism of Roman Italy, between mid-Republican times and the Early Empire, shows that the historical evolution of urban settlement systems and their great variety of urban forms, can only be understood by examining a whole series of region-specific factors. Climatic and environmental factors, economic relationships between cities and their hinterlands, hierarchical relationships between cities, and communication and interactions between cities belonging to the same regional system, all influence the chances for small towns to arise and survive. Determining factors such as the geographical distribution of agricultural or mineral resources, the connectivity of the area with the Mediterranean Sea or with navigable river systems, the density and quality of the road system or the specific ethnic and social composition of the autochthonous population before Roman dominance are all factors that influence the nature of the urban network further developed by Rome. A good example of the resulting urban diversity within a specific regional context is the urban network and evolution in central-Adriatic Italy, where the ancient regions of the ager Gallicus (later 'Adriatic Umbria') and Picenum are located (Fig. 9.1). Today, quite satisfying and reliable information about urban site size and layout, and sometimes even early town development, can be found in a series of deserted towns in this region, where almost 50% of the Roman town sites were partly or totally abandoned or displaced after the Roman Imperial period. The strategy of extensive non-invasive survey was introduced here from 2002 onwards by a Ghent University team under my direction, in particular in the town sites of Potentia, Ricina, Trea and Septempeda (Vermeulen et al., 2017). The approach has since then been applied by several teams intensively surveying and studying abandoned Roman towns and their hinterlands in the region (e.g. Suasa, Ostra, Sentinum, Forum Sempronii, Tifernum Mataurense), which before 2000 were known only via a few excavated 'windows' in their sometimes ill-defined town areas. A whole series of these partially or fully abandoned Roman towns are now being uncovered via intensive total surveys, integrated into apposite excavations in carefully selected areas. Such well-integrated strategies mean that it is now not only possible to obtain good information about their size, general internal organisation, and functions during their heyday in the early Imperial period, but sometimes also to gain a better understanding of the early phases of town formation, and of certain changes and sometimes radical shifts in the urban development of these centres. One of the town centres, studied intensively over the past years, Septempeda, deserves further attention, as it might be a good case study for the phenomenon visible in a whole series of small towns spread over Italy, deviating somehow from the canonical model of the Roman town concept. The site of Septempeda (within the modern province of Macerata, Marche) grew from its probable origin as a mid-Republican village into a Roman town along a diverticulum of the via Flaminia linking the consular road from Nocera Umbra through the valley of the River Potenza to Ancona and the Adriatic coast. The ancient Roman site is located at some 50 km inland from the Adriatic coast and lies directly north of the river, on a flattish to slightly sloping river terrace (Fig. 9.1). The former urban area also enclosed a small hill stretching immediately north of this terrace. Today arable land prevails here, as the site was abandoned in early medieval times and its remaining population moved to an upland location in nearby San Severino Marche. A small rural church and a few modern houses are the only constructions in the now legally protected archaeological park, whose limits coincide more or less with the abandoned Roman town area. Excavations during the 20th century uncovered here an almost complete Imperial Roman bath complex, scanty remains of at least two Early Imperial domus, some stretches of the street system, and several elements of the town defences, including parts of the town wall, and two monumental gates in the southwest and east sides of the wall circuit (Anon, 2003)(Anon, 2004)). Late Republican and Imperial period finds near and outside the town walls comprise small groups of Roman burials located near the main outgoing roads west and east of the town centre and parts of a large pottery workshop outside the presumed western gate. Scant historical and written data on the origin of the agglomeration suggest that the core of this urban settlement was a roadside settlement, still called oppidum in the Liber Coloniarum (Anon, n.d.). When Roman and Latin colonists settled here in the late 3rd or early 2nd century BC, as a result of the Lex Flaminia, the place most likely received the status of praefectura, while it became a municipium only around the mid-1st century BC (Paci, 1999)(Anon, 2006)). The recent archaeological investigations (below) show that status promotion was preceded a few decades earlier by the erection of a monumental town wall, incorporating the habitation nucleus near the river and the adjoining small hill into an enclosed irregular area of approximately 15 ha. The still ill-understood old settlement core along the east-west-oriented via Flaminia per Picenum Anconam certainly comprised a late Republican artisanal unit that produced black gloss ceramics, while certain reused architectonic decoration fragments found in the later bath complex suggest the existence of a late Republican sacred building nearby, perhaps to be identified with the temple for the goddess Feronia (CIL IX 5711; (Anon, n.d.). That one of the gates belonging to this wall, in the southwest of the town, was built over a series of 2nd century to early 1st century BC graves, demonstrates the spatial expansion of the settlement by the beginning of the last century before our era. It looks as if a former burial area was by this time incorporated in a now larger and better structured settlement with urban features. While the 20th-century excavations and the study of antiquarian collections of sculpture and epigraphy from the territory of Septempeda (Anon, 1996)(Anon, 2003) revealed some essential information about the ancient town, most of the urban topography remained to be discovered. This was not helped by the almost silent ancient written sources about the town, or by the fact that no above-ground traces of its architecture remain visible today. Since 2004, however, the urban site has been the object of more systematic archaeological investigations, using a range of techniques currently employed for urban surveys and topographic studies on greenfield sites in the Mediterranean. On the one hand, a programme of non-invasive prospection allowed the team from Ghent University to take a sturdy grip on the internal organisation of the urban topography of this Roman town (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The main field operations of the Belgian archaeologists so far include feature detection and monitoring with oblique and low altitude aerial photography, geophysical prospection of the whole town site using magnetic, georadar, and earth resistance methods, some limited artefact surveys, and the study of the recently available high resolution satellite imagery and LiDAR data of the area. Systematic aerial photography of the site in different seasons between 2004 and 2021, using traditional small aeroplanes and drones, and normal as well as near infrared photography, allowed the Ghent team to map a whole series of distinct crop marks in fields of alfalfa herbs covering large parts of the intramural areas. The interpretative mapping identified many elements of the urban street network (Fig. 9.2), the forum with part of its monumental buildings, many structures belonging to housing sectors, parts of the circuit wall and towers, a previously unknown gate (southeast gate), and an impressive monumental complex with porticoes outside the eastern gate. From 2010 to 2021 a multi-method geophysical research strategy was undertaken, comprising principally magnetometry and earth resistance prospection. Both methods combined covered an area of c. 15 ha, comprising 80% of the intramural space and some areas outside the walls (Plate 9.1). Tests with additional geophysical techniques aimed at obtaining even more precision for some of the detected structures comprised a small georadar survey and a few ERT profiles (disappointing GPR results, probably due to the clay-rich content of the soil, prompted us to quickly abandon this technique, while the time consuming ERT profiles were only applied near specific areas, such as the formerly excavated baths and the newly discovered western gate). The results from these geophysical operations not only made it possible to confirm or help to interpret some of the structures discovered by aerial photography, but also allowed the detection of significant new traces pertaining to houses, streets, and the towns defences. All newly mapped traces from aerial photography and geophysics were subsequently confronted with, or enhanced by, generally available remote sensing material, such as vertical aerial photography, LiDAR coverage and some commercially available satellite imagery. On the other hand, a whole series of targeted stratigraphic excavations and trial trenches, dug under the supervision of the Soprintendenza Archeologia Belle Arti e Paesaggio delle Marche between 2004 and 2018, and a focused augering campaign by the Ghent team in 2021, allowed some of the older excavation data and the gradually revealed remote sensing evidence to be verified (Vermeulen et al., 2020); Vermeulen and Taelman forthcoming). The best stratigraphic opportunities were offered by some development-led archaeology resulting from interventions aimed at enhancing the modern infrastructure of the Municipality of San Severino. Although 9. Septempeda: integrated approaches for revealing a 'small town' in Picenum the locations of most of these were not the result of deliberate archaeological choices, the outcome of these excavations (covering a total of some 1,250 m²) allowed us to compare stratigraphic data with the results from remote sensing operations. They not only helped verifying some of the older ill-documented excavations, but allowed us to discover a whole series of new structures pertaining to the town defences, and architectural features in several intra-and extramural areas. They added very valuable information about the dating, depth, and character of the presumed archaeology, confirmed or changed many hypotheses, and also provided a good sample for the study of the material culture of this town. The additional hand-augering campaign (34 cores) on a north-south section of the urban area and on a series of features, improved our understanding of the near-surface geology, the geomorphological situation, and the evolutionary history of the site, and helped with verifying the nature, depth and date of particular features detected by geophysical and aerial survey. It is no surprise that the resulting map of the ancient town, combining all legacy and newly obtained structural data, illustrates the forma urbis during its phase of main floruit, the early Imperial period. Even if several elements (town wall, forum, main streets, etc.) were no doubt planned here in late Republican times, it can be expected that parts of the intramural architecture and some elements of the street system were gradually altered throughout the centuries. Nevertheless, for our broad understanding of the local urbanism at Septempeda we now possess a very valuable basic overview, that we can synthesise briefly here (Plate 9.2). The monumental town wall, built in opus quadratum technique with local sandstone blocks, is on average c. 2 m wide and approximately 1.5 km long. Its irregular pentagonal circuit incorporates most of the habitation nucleus laid out on the almost flat terrace north of the River Potenza. It also incorporates a small hill, perhaps in order to create an extra element for defence and visual control, but at the same time allowing space for a kind of arx, as is well known from many a Republican town in Italy (e.g. (Anon, n.d.). Stratigraphic excavations near the eastern gate in 2018 showed that the sandstone wall was flanked on its inner side by an earthen bank (agger) 9-10 m wide, probably bordered on the town side by a small wall or ditch. Bank and ditch were confirmed by remote sensing in several areas of the circuit, respectively by aerial photography in the eastern part of the wall circuit and by a deep profile earth resistance prospection (ERT) near the western gate. It is not yet clear when exactly the town wall construction should be dated to, but suggestions have been made of a date connected with events a few years after the Social War, such as an intervention by Sulla who settled the veterans of war operations in Picenum (e.g. at Auximum) in their region of origin shortly after 90 BC. This chronology is currently the most likely option (Anon, n.d.)) not contradicted so far by the stratigraphic data and the few finds associated with the wall construction. The wall had at least five monumental entrance gates (east, southeast, north, west, and southwest), two of which -the southeast and west gates -are only known by way of remote sensing, whilst another one -the north gate -remains somewhat hypothetically positioned on the map. Apart from the towers connected with the gates -the west, southwest and east gate each with two towers, the southeast gate with only one -a series of isolated towers was also found, creating a defendable wall circuit with strongpoints at more or less regular distances varying between 50-90 m. Most of the towers are round, with a diameter of some 7.5 m, but near the southeast gate a rectangular tower was constructed, indicating maybe a later date and addition to the defensive system. The two gates connected with the main central east-west street of the town were no doubt the most important ones, as they ultimately connected Septempeda with Rome (west gate) and Ancona (east gate). The excavated southwest gate, which possibly gave access to a necropolis and maybe to a crossing (bridge?) over the River Potenza, was also equally impressive (Fig. 9.3). All four discovered gates are of the so-called courtyard type, with an inner courtyard with the axis of the court extending perpendicularly inward from the line of the wall. Outwards, the three main courtyard gates were half closed by an additional stretch of wall joining two flanking towers, thus creating a very defendable semicircular or pear-shaped concave outer space. This central court gate system developed in the 4th century BC in Greece and the Hellenistic East, and gradually spread to the Italian peninsula through Magna Graecia (Anon, n.d.). From the 2nd century BC onwards these types of gates are often flanked by one or two towers (Anon, n.d.) and the specific disposition of the towers creating a semicircular to pear-shaped space outside the gate was introduced in Italy in a series of late Republican cities built by Rome, in particular under the reign of Sulla (Anon, 2012). The amazingly detailed aerial and geophysical imagery of broad linear traces interpretable as buried streets allows us to map large parts of the town's street system. These features were confirmed in several places by stratigraphic observations (excavations and augerings) of the still-existing streets, both inside and outside the wall circuit. The present evidence indicates that, at least during the early Empire, many streets were paved, and that they had an average width of no more than 4 m. The street system of a Roman town is partly conditioned by the need for connections with its territory, and with the world beyond its borders, and partly by the planning of the urban centre itself. In Septempeda the east-west oriented diverticulum linking the via Flaminia at Nuceria (Nocera Umbra) with the Adriatic coast became the conditioning factor, as it was from the street village around this decumanus maximus that the urban reality emerged. This east-west street gave access to far away Rome and to Ancona, to adjoining coastal areas and to other towns in or near the Potenza valley, such as Camerinum, Matilica, Trea, Ricina, and Potentia. Other internal streets were connected to the three remaining gates, giving access to the agricultural areas to the north of town, to cemeteries, and to the valley floor and the presumed river crossing in the south, beyond which other nearby towns, such as Tolentinum and Urbs Salvia could easily be reached. Although the urban planning does not seem to have involved a very strict orthogonal street system, and the network of streets might have grown rather gradually, there was surely an intention to create a series of axes parallel to the central road, and a few perpendicular connections to ensure easy access all around. This evolution must be seen in association with the demographic bloom of the settlement from the 1st century BC onwards, when living quarters perhaps gradually filled the intramural space once the town wall was built. It is likely that simultaneously with the creation of the wall circuit and some of the main street arteries, a forum was developed in the very centre of the settlement, along the decumanus maximus. The insertion of such a public centre in the late Republican roadside settlement of Septempeda can, together with the completion of the wall circuit, be seen as crucial for the effort during the 1st century BC to convey the idea of a town. It demonstrates the adaptation of Italic population centres to the new standards of the Roman way of life and surely promoted the acculturation of the local population. It is probably here that cults for the gods Feronia and Jupiter, both attested by inscriptions (Anon, 1996), and later for the Emperor, must have concentrated their activity. But it was also a market centre, well connected to the road system, and the focus for the whole surrounding territory, as well as the place for the legal, political, and cultural matters of the community. The precise location of the forum of Septempeda was only discovered in 2009, as a result of the integration of aerial photography with geophysical prospections. Its plaza, identified immediately north of the main decumanus, was recognised as a rectangular square of at least 60 × 30 m, positioned with its longitudinal axis perpendicular to this street. The square was at some point in time surrounded by a series of public buildings and monuments, such as a possible basilica to the north, the (excavated) bath complex to the west, and perhaps several temples and tabernae to the east. The area immediately south of this forum and the central east-west street was partly occupied by a series of rich domus as the old excavation evidence suggests. Although there is still a lack of precise chronological information about the different buildings surrounding the forum, it can be presumed on the basis of parallels in the region that the period between the last decades of the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD were the main phases of dynamic transformations and of monumentalisation of this urban centre. The excavated bathhouse may have been one of the latest additions to this public area, as it was probably built in the first decades of the 1st century AD. There is evidence that it might have been (partly?) in use until the early 5th century AD. The character and evolution of housing in Septempeda is still difficult to trace, as no fully excavated houses are known so far. Thanks to discoveries in the 1920s and 1970s in an area to the southwest of the forum, where four mosaic floors and the remains of painted stucco were found and minimally documented, and, more recently, due to the integration of aerial photography, geophysics, and targeted augering, it is 9. Septempeda: integrated approaches for revealing a 'small town' in Picenum now possible to map parts of houses in almost all intramural sectors of the town. Very provisional data indicates that the richer and larger ones, belonging to the domustype that emulates Hellenistic and central Tyrrhenian residences, are mostly to be found near the central area, especially near the forum and along the main decumanus. They are characterised by their elongated rectangular shape, a certain symmetry, the presence of an atrium surrounded by rooms at the centre, and often one or more peristilia towards the back. Excavation and augering evidence suggest the use of solid building materials, and sometimes more luxurious mosaic floor decorations in several houses. Of course, smaller houses, or combinations of simple housing with typical economic urban infrastructure (e.g. shops, workshops) must also have been present, but these are more difficult to identify among the ephemeral evidence of crop marks. Finally, our surveys and the excavations have demonstrated that certain extramural parts of Septempeda were the subject of urban expansion and growth. Immediately outside the western gate an elongated area with production facilities (e.g. pottery workshops) exemplifies the need for late Republican to early Imperial productive areas to shift away from the public centre. Such a move of artisanal/economic activities towards the edges of the urban area is probably also part of a gentrification of the spaces surrounding the forum, increasingly occupied by high-status residences. Further down the road to the west several organised burial areas were discovered, reaching areas along the linear road trace at more than 1 km outside the gate. A large necropolis was partly studied between the arterial roads that leave the town through the west gate and the southwest gate. A strong visibility was likely guaranteed to the necropolis by the passage of the important diverticulum of the via Flaminia, today largely covered by the modern valley road. A majority of the excavated burials date to the 1st-2nd centuries AD, and at least some tombs on the roadside had a monumental character. While typical buildings for games and spectacles such as a theatre or an amphitheatre, have not been detected in Septempeda, we can now attribute a partly similar function to the monumental precinct found outside the town wall near the eastern gate. Here a large open square (of approximately 12,000 m²) delimited by the town wall and with porticoes on at least two sides was first detected by aerial photography and later identified as a probable campus (Vermeulen et al., 2020). Partial excavation of its main central structure, an open-air swimming pool (30 × 15 m), allowed us to date the building of this sports complex to the 1st century AD. The original meaning of the word campus is that of a free and flat space, used as a multifunctional public area with a civic purpose: the physical training and armed exercises by the young citizens of a community took place here. This physical training, in particular arms drill, horse riding, and swimming, but also gymnastics and other sports, was supposed to complete their intellectual training (Borlenghi, 2011). The campus was also one of the main public spaces intended for the community, where each person had the opportunity to take care of their body, to devote themselves to exercises, to walk, and to socialise in the shade of trees or under sheltering porticoes. In a relatively small town like Septempeda, the presence of such a complex may have also replaced the need for a more monumental, but also more expensive, amphitheatre building. From c. 90 BC to the reign of Augustus, the aftermath of the Social War and the visit of Caesar to the region of Picenum, triggered strong integration of the slowly developing central-Adriatic region with the 'Roman system'. The earlier colonisation and urbanisation waves of Romans and Latins on and near the Adriatic coast during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC were now followed by an accelerated urbanism through municipalisation and the settlement of new colonists in many settlements of the interior lands (Anon, 2017). This phenomenon, which has many parallels in other regions of peninsular Italy, produced in the central Adriatic region a more or less artificially created 'finalised' urban landscape with a high density of small to medium-sized towns interlinked by roads. Many pre-Roman hilltop centres and other less successful former central settlements of indigenous origin lying away from the new arteries began to be gradually and definitively abandoned. The small number of pre-Roman centres that survived paled into insignificance compared to the successful coastal Latin and Roman citizen colonies and to the quite evenly spread new small towns in the interior valleys that often grew out of praefecturae thanks to an intense injection of people from Rome or the Tyrrhenian region. This process of town formation, stimulated by Rome along the major roads and their diverticula, often following the valley corridors, was very much a key feature of Roman urbanism during the late Republic, when the mobile elite involved in the creation of new architecture in Italy, partly inspired by the Hellenistic example, transformed the geography and created monuments for the future in the form of towns. Interesting locations along the road and river network, where settlers and viritane colonists from Latium started to congregate, created optimal conditions for the decisive step towards urbanism. As in many other situations, the case of Septempeda in the central Potenza valley seems to exemplify a model of gradual replacement of a former fortified Italic village. In this particular case, the Picene hilltop site of Monte Pitino, located some 7 km to the east of the new Roman roadside town in the valley floor lost its prime importance during this process, and was ultimately abandoned (Anon, n.d.). Interestingly, archaeological evidence from Septempeda suggests that the start of this process came a few decades before the municipalisation of the region, and therefore one can assume that other (partly strategic) reasons, such as the settlement by Sulla of veterans in this area, could explain the earlier transformation from flourishing roadside village into a real town with imposing walls and gates. The further monumentalisation of this small town in the century following its promotion is then probably the result of further economic and demographic success, stimulated by a 9. Septempeda: integrated approaches for revealing a 'small town' in Picenum healthy competition between communities in the same region and the aspirations of local elites for urbanitas and career promotion. The economic base of such an inland small town, located in a fertile and diverse settlement areas on the crossroads of the rolling hills of Marche and its Apennine upland, was overwhelmingly agrarian. Like many others, this centre presented a model of 'urban governance' over rural resources. Urban elites received a disproportionate share of rural income and spent it mostly on urban goods and imported luxuries; taxes paid by country-dwellers financed urban amenities. Cities depended on the surplus of their countryside, but land management strategies served urban elites and policies. An additional impulse given to such a centre was possibly also the settling of a large number of veterans there during the Triumvirate and the early Augustan reign. The further development of the forum, set in the centre of the town, with its plaza surrounded by a set of public and sacred buildings, such as probably a basilica and a curia, a few temples, rows of tabernae and a bathhouse, can be linked to this event. That probably under the reign of Augustus a large campus was built outside the town walls, near the eastern town gate, might be another indication that veterans were deeply involved in the construction of new buildings and the development of public infrastructures in Septempeda. From then onwards the small town, strategically located on an economically relevant route between the Tiber valley, the Apennine mountains and the Adriatic Sea, was fully equipped to surf on the waves of relative prosperity and stability that characterized the larger part of the first two centuries of our era. Roman towns in the longue durée Chapter 10 Lunae: new perspectives from recent archaeological fieldwork Simonetta Menchelli, Paolo Sangriso, Silvia Marini & Rocco Marcheschi 10.1. Lunae: an overview Simonetta Menchelli Lunae was founded in 177 BC as a Roman colony in a problematic district because of Ligurian resistance (about this people: De Marinis & Spadea 2007; Paltineri (Anon, n.d.). Rome had to conquer them in order to continue the unification of the Italian peninsula (Anon, n.d.) and facilitate its ongoing expansion towards the northwestern Mediterranean. In fact, the port of this district was used by the Romans even before the foundation of the colony: from Lunae Portus in 195 BC the consul Cato sailed for Spain against the Carthaginians (Livy 34.8.4). This territory was in a strategic position because it could easily be reached from the south, along the coastal axis that would become the via Aurelia Nova, built in 200 or 144 BC, as an extension of the via Aurelia Vetus from Pisa to the north (Anon, n.d.). Moreover, Lunae was connected, through an efficient road and river network, both to Parma (and therefore to the Po Valley) and to Luca, the Latin colony founded in 180 BC, also with an anti-Ligurian function (Fig. 10.1). In the early 2nd century BC, many military actions in this district were documented by (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)). In 180 BC Rome managed to deport 48,000 Ligurians to Samnium, and therefore the colony of Lunae could be founded, with 2,000 settlers each receiving a plot of 51.5 jugera (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Lunae can be included in the 2nd century BC 'maritime experimental' type of colony, that maintained the usual plan of a military fort (Fig. 10.2) (particularly necessary because the Apuanian Ligurians were only definitively defeated in 155 BC by M. Claudius Marcellus), but having an agrarian character: many more settlers compared to the 'traditional' 300 colonists and with very large allotments to compensate for the risk (Anon, 1969)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In the town's foundation phase, interaction between the local people and the elite (Anon, 2008)(Anon, 2022)) is barely perceptible, given the disruptive intervention of Rome, although cultural exchanges are documented in numerous graves identified in this territory (Anon, n.d.). The wall circuit was 560 m north-south by 440 m east-west, enclosing an area of more than 24 ha: therefore, Lunae was a settlement of medium dimensions, more or less equal or larger than many 3rd-2nd-century BC Roman colonies along the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic coasts (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The town walls today are completely buried, but they have been identified by aerial photography and, in some parts, by archaeological excavations (Pasquinucci & Menchelli, 2023). The plan shows an indentation in the southeastern sector of the wall circuit, recorded in historical cartography at least from the second half of the 18th century. In the relevant literature, this indentation has always been considered an adaptation to the shoreline, but recent geoarchaeological research has proved that it was due to the presence of a palaeoriverbed of the Parmignola stream (Bini et al., 2013)) today represented by a canal not surprisingly called 'il canale dei grandi muri'. Figure 10.2. Plan of Lunae, Soprintendenza Archeologica Liguria (Anon, n.d.). Our Luni-Porta Marina Project (Anon, n.d.)) deals precisely with the southeast quarter of the town, immediately to the east of the cardo maximus, and near this indentation and 'Porta Marina' (i.e. 'Porta Meridionale' on Fig. 10.2; see also Fig. 10.3). We chose this area, firstly, because it had never been investigated before neither by 19th-century archaeologists nor in contemporary times, and, secondly, because of its strategic location for studying the connections between Lunae and its harbour system, which from the mid-1st century BC was of great economic importance since becoming the trading centre of the white Apuanian marble (Anon, n.d.). According to Strabo's description (5.2.5), this harbour system was large and made up of various basins, and in fact the geoarchaeological investigations have identified, in the southeast sector of the town, a large inlet with a deep draft, and therefore particularly suitable for the naves lapidariae, while a river port has been located to the west for lower tonnage ships (Bini et al., 2013). Considering the town's urbanistic development, the most ancient settlement in Lunae has been identified in some archaeological trenches below the Capitolium and the tabernae (C, D, E) in the western portico of the forum. This settlement dates back to the late 3rd to early 2nd century BC and consisted of huts featuring clay and straw walls with curved-tiled roofs. It also included some fireplaces and pits interpreted as garbage dumps, and a hole containing Graeco-Italic amphorae fixed vertically, most probably for libation offerings. Moreover, a stockade consisting of east-west-oriented double poles was brought to light: most probably it had defensive functions, or it may have been meant to separate the different housing sectors (Rossignani et al., 2002). Naturally, it is difficult to establish whether this settlement preceded the foundation of the colony, when portus Lunae was utilised by military expeditions, or if these huts were the temporary dwellings of the colonists before the construction of the town. In any case, it is significant that this first settlement is close to the main 'junction' (diverticulum) connecting to the via Aurelia Nova, and this is where the central area of the town would develop shortly afterwards (Anon, n.d.). Moving on to the foundation of the colony, it is obvious that the wall circuit was built at the same time as the founding of Lunae in 177 BC, followed by the most significant civil and religious buildings (the forum, the Capitolium and the Great Temple dedicated to Luna, Apollo, and either to Dionysus or to the Genius of the Roman People) (Anon, n.d.). Burial rituals of dogs identified both below Taberna E in the forum (an entire skeleton deposited in two ollae) and in the northeastern sector of the town, where the theatre would later be built (two burials of dogs in pits) also refer to the initial phases of the colony (Gervasini, 2020). Given that these graves were respectively placed in the most ancient settlement of Luna and at a short distance from the southeast corner of the walls, their meaning is evident: dogs, a symbol of purification, were considered protectors in the transitional and transformational phases (from enemy territory to conquered territory, from outside to inside, from the world of the living to the world of the dead). Similar dog burials to protect the town walls have been documented in the colonies of Ariminum (268 BC), Paestum (273 BC) and perhaps Saena Julia (Gervasini, 2020). Being a 2nd-century BC colony, Lunae could have been endowed with a forum as early as its initial phases: it had elongated dimensions and it was lined by tabernae, 10. Lunae: new perspectives from recent archaeological fieldwork according to a late 4th-century BC successful model, most probably derived from the forum Romanum (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The decumanus maximus replaced the above-mentioned sideway of the via Aurelia Nova which entered the town through the eastern gate and continued northwards from the western gate. The cardo maximus was the main road between Lunae's northern suburbium and its harbour area, but it was divided into two sectors (the northern and the southern) by the Capitolium-Forum block. Although in this period the square grid pattern was spreading (Anon, n.d.), as documented in the nearby colonies of Parma (183 BC) and Luca (180 BC), Lunae had insulae with the traditional rectangular form and a constant width (2 actus = 240 pedes = 70 m), while their length varied: it was 90-95 m, and 71, 120, 140 m respectively north and south of the decumanus maximus (Anon, n.d.). Most probably, this town plan was the most suitable for the Lunae's topographical context which, as we have seen, was affected by the proximity of its harbour system and of the palaeo-riverbed of the Parmignola stream. In the late 2nd/early 1st century BC the Capitolium was rebuilt, and in this period some of the rich domus of Lunae, which would characterise the townscape until the late Roman period, started to be constructed (Durante, 2010). Regarding this topic, our project made a significant contribution to the knowledge of the urban planning of Lunae by bringing to light Domus A and Domus B in the Porta Marina quarter (par. 10.2). The sector of the insula excavated in the Porta Marina quarter is occupied by two domus (A-B) (Fig. 10.3) featuring a long period of use (from the Republican period to the early 8th century AD) with important building transformations (Domus A was partially occupied by a workshops and Domus B by Temple C). As in other cases in Lunae, the two domus shared the east-west perimeter wall: parietes communes have been found in the 'Domus Repubblicana' and in the late Republican phase of the 'Domus degli Affreschi' (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Given its planimetric, organisational and decorative characteristics, Domus B is of remarkable interest not only for its structural evidence, but also for its position in the Lunae plan, providing new data for discussing the organisation of the space within the town (Fig. 10.3 and Plate 10.1B). The cross-referencing of excavation data (pottery, fresco fragments, and floor decorations) allows us to place the construction of Domus B between 70 and 50 BC (Anon, n.d.) and the organisational scheme fits the type with atrium (B4, about 160 m 2 ) (Anon, n.d.), but already featuring a peristyle of considerable size with a central columned area and a nymphaeum (B12), a probable triclinium (B5) and at least one reception room (B8) (Anon, n.d.). Lacking traces of pillars around the impluvium, the atrium can be considered of Tuscanic style, as documented in other domus in Lunae ('Domus degli Affreschi' / first phase (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.); 'Domus Occidentale'/second phase and 'Domus degli Affreschi' (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The atrium was flanked (Vitr. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) by two alae (B1, B9a) and four cubicula (B2-3, B10, B11). The basin of the impluvium would have been completely removed by the construction of Temple C (par. 10.3) and, underneath it, there are no traces of either a cistern or 10. Lunae: new perspectives from recent archaeological fieldwork channelling systems (an element common to all the domus investigated to date in Lunae (Anon, n.d.). It is worth noting the presence, in axis with the impluvium basin, of a plinth most probably intended to support the cartibulum (Anon, n.d.). On its eastern side, the atrium was flanked by a tablinum (B7) and by the corridor (B6) leading into the peristyle (B12), which presents a slightly offset plan to the north with respect to the front of the Domus B, thus occupying a sector expected, by symmetry, to belong to the Domus A. Its central area, having brick columns covered with stucco, in the Byzantine/ Lombard period was used as a necropolis (at the moment four tombs have been brought to light: (Anon, 2022). The pavements of the domus are of a remarkable quality, starting with the mosaic of the fauces, in black and white rows of adjacent squares, delineated and divided by their diagonals (Anon, n.d.). This geometric motif is connected, by means of a wide white band, with the figured mosaic leading into the atrium. This is formed by a band of rectangles with arched structures surmounted by T-shaped merlons which accommodate -on a white background -ships with their masts laid-down (Plate 10.1A): most probably this mosaic represented navalia (Vincenti, 2001). The floor of the atrium continued with an elegant orthogonal punctuation of white marble cubes on a black background field (Gervasini et al., 2021), its floor continuing from ala B1 and cubicle B2. Ala B1 preserves part of the mosaic threshold and its preparation in the southern part, while the northern one is paved with a cocciopesto floor without inserts. Cubicle B2, having a marble-based cement floor, was only accessible from room B1. The organisation of these two lateral rooms is also reflected in the southern side, where the division between rooms B9a and B9b is indicated not only by the different floors (B9a having mosaic in alternating black and white isosceles triangles with preparatory drawing preserved on the cement base: (Anon, n.d.), but also by an east-west wall that separated them. Given the presence of Temple C, we cannot hypothesise the relationship between room B9a and room B10, but since room B9b can only be reached through the threshold connecting it with room B10, most probably, by symmetry with the northern side, room B10 was entered through room B9a. The floor of cubicle B10 is lost, while B9b retains flooring evidently related to its function. The latter room was paved in opus sectile: only the mortar imprints remain, indicating an orthogonal composition of adjacent squares and rhombuses bordered by rows of tiles, framed by a pink local limestone frame. The northeastern corner of the room, aligned with the threshold in the southwestern corner, is instead paved with a marble-based cement having coloured inserts; linear traces of mortar identified on this small square space suggest that it could be utilised for a fixture or housing a piece of furniture, which we obviously cannot identify. The tablinum (B7) has a black-and-white mosaic floor with a central pseudoemblem surrounded by a scale motif, bordered by a double red and black frame, with vine shoots and vine leaves in the corners (Gervasini et al., 2021). The corridor (B6), paved in cocciopesto without inserts, led into the peristyle with a marble-based cement floor with red and blue coloured inserts. The likely triclinium (B5) was most probably paved like room B2 and opened onto the peristyle. Room B8, also opened onto the peristyle, presents an opus sectile floor with a perspective cube motif consisting of three-coloured rhombuses in local limestone having a central pseudo-emblem in a geometric pattern; this motif is bordered by a series of alternating coloured tiles; a further sequence of square tiles with embedded square elements in alternating colours continues up to the western wall with a marble band. The decorative apparatus of the domus obviously corresponds to the organisation of the housing spaces, and therefore, although excavations are still ongoing, we can present some considerations on this topic. The navalia mosaic, at the end of the entrance corridor, indicates the source of the dominus' wealth, while the presence of the cartibulum, in axis with the impluvium basin and the tablinum, seems to be a clear reference to the traditional values of the Roman house. The characteristics of the rooms gravitating around the atrium permit us to consider this sector not completely 'public' but to distinguish between different degrees of this definition. In fact, while the tablinum is an open and visible place of power and communication, a first degree of privacy is given by cubicle B2, accessible only from ala B1, which is also open onto the atrium. A completely private or very exclusive access can be attributed to the rooms on the southern side of the atrium: ala B9a was most probably transformed into a vestibule for cubicle B10, which guaranteed the only way into cubicle B9b. In this room the restricted access and the characteristics of the floor (featuring a funnel-shaped perspective given by the different sizes of the rows of tiles) suggest an optical pathway tied to the likely furniture originally present in the northeastern corner, which perhaps contained/represented sacred, or in any case very intimate, elements shared by the inhabitants of the Domus B (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Corridor B6, on the northern side of the tablinum, gave access to the peristyle, which was overlooked by room B5, most probably used as a triclinium, and by room B8 that, given its large size and highquality floor decoration, can be interpreted as a reception room (without excluding the triclinium function) where the dominus could receive important guests in a private and pleasant hall, open onto the colonnaded space of the peristyle. So many floor typologies, its complex plan, the respect for tradition (given the most probable presence of the cartibulum) identify Domus B as a high-quality building, in no way inferior to the contemporary domus facing the forum and therefore an expression of the same social class. The presence of such domus along the cardo maximus prompts some reflections about the urban structure of Lunae. Given the small size of the town, if members of the local elite built their domus not only on the forum but also along the cardo maximus, we can assume that the latter (which, through the southern gate, came from the port area, the most representative site of the town's wealth) was also considered part of the centre. From this point of view, the area around this axis would almost take on the role of the 'town's atrium', where the protagonists of its economic 10. Lunae: new perspectives from recent archaeological fieldwork development appear and present themselves, and the mosaic with the navalia would be its most obvious symbol. In the first century AD, the Domus B in the Porta Marina quarter underwent a fundamental rebuilding and the small Temple C was constructed on this site. The new building, whose structures are preserved at the foundation level, has a rectangular plan (Anon, n.d.).9 m) divided into two rooms (Fig. 10.4A). For its installation, a single rectangular cut affected the mosaic floor of the atrium, part of the impluvium and the rooms on the south side of the domus. It was a small tetrastyle temple, prostyle or in antis, probably built on a podium and accessible, via a staircase, on the west side (Anon, n.d.). Along with the construction of the temple, a series of building interventions reconfigured the plan of the rooms of the domus located along the north and east sides of the atrium: the inner walls of the rooms were razed to the ground; the entrances to the atrium (B1, B6, B7) and to the peristyle (B12) were closed. After these operations, the floors were raised using different building materials resulting from the spoliation of the domus. The renovation of the rooms located along the north and east sides of the atrium created an uninterrupted space (4.30 m wide), probably a porticus, that skirted the temple and the square that surrounded it (Anon, n.d.). The imposing work thus defined an open area, between the temple and the porticus, probably paved in marble (c. 5.4 m wide on the north side and c. 2.7 m on the east side). The refurbishment of the domus and the construction of the temple were brought to completion as a unitary project, to be dated in the second half of the 1st century AD (Anon, n.d.). We have no evidence of similar operations in the southern rooms of the domus, that are still being excavated, and in the western sector, which have been deeply altered by post-depositional phenomena. At the moment, we can propose two different solutions about the plan of the porticus on the southern side. In this regard, the information provided by the southern perimeter wall of the domus is decisive: it was dismantled in ancient times, but its traces along the southern side of cubicle B9 are about 5.4 m away from the temple. Assuming that the temple had been erected in the centre of the available space, according to a principle of symmetry, two reconstructive hypotheses are possible: (1) the southern arm of the porticus could have been extended beyond the southern wall, involving the structures of another building, still to be identified; (2) more likely, the temple did not display any portico on the southern side, which was therefore closed by the perimeter wall of Domus B. It is still not clear how -along the eastern side of the temple -the porticus was connected with the cardo maximus which, by then, was colonnaded (Anon, n.d.). At the same time, we still have to understand whether, and in which way, the peristyle of the domus was involved in the renovation of the eastern sector of the building. In any case, we know that the east-west perimeter wall shared by Domus A and B defined the northern limit of the religious complex, and it was respected as a demarcation line between two properties until Late Antiquity. The construction of Temple C is part of a phase of growth and urban development of the Roman colony, documented by the building activity that involved the public and private spaces of the town from the Julio-Claudian period, that has frequently been related to the lucrative marble economy (Gervasini, 2015). It was from this moment onwards that the vast programme of monumentalisation of the town centre was progressively implemented, starting with the forum, which was paved, and its porticoes rebuilt in marble (Anon, n.d.). Meanwhile, the theatre was built in the northeastern corner of the colony's plan (Berton et al., 2020)(Anon, n.d.). A building, perhaps the curia, was erected in the middle of the southern side of the forum and it was flanked by two quadrangular squares, paved in opus sectile (E 1 , the (Anon, n.d.)). eastern one; E 2 , the western one) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The 'area con fontane', in the southeastern sector of the forum, can be attributed to this phase; it was communicating to the north with a meeting room, possibly the seat of the collegium of Augustales (Anon, n.d.). In the Claudian age, a large porticoed square was built alongside the forum vetus and housed, along the southern side, a single-cell temple on a podium, called 'Tempio di Diana', modelled on the imperial fora in Rome (Anon, n.d.). On the opposite side of the forum adiectum, the basilica was built in the same phase, incorporating the eastern arm of the portico of the Capitolium (Anon, n.d.). The rich domus provides further elements to define the framework of renovation that affected Lunae from the Julio-Claudian age onwards. The construction of the 'Domus settentrionale', located near the northern gate of the town walls, is dated to the end of the Tiberian period. It presents a vast residential wing gravitating around the peristyle; all the rooms were paved in opus sectile (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The coeval 'Domus di Oceano', in the western sector of the town, displayed a series of (Anon, n.d.). B: The forum and the domus overlooking it (late-Republican period) (Anon, n.d.). C: 'Domus settentrionale' (Anon, n.d.). (Anon, n.d.). Lunae: new perspectives from recent archaeological fieldwork rooms opening onto a Tuscanic atrium paved in grit and polychrome marble scutulae (Anon, n.d.). This renovation frenzy also involved the 'Domus degli Affreschi', located near the southeastern corner of the forum, which can be traced back to the same chronological horizon. The domus, realised through the acquisition of several residential units, was made of two areas connected by porticoes and gardens (Anon, 2012)) (Anon, n.d.). As it has been pointed out, this vast building programme affecting the political centre of Lunae (and of many other towns in Italy) entailed the expropriation of sectors of domus located near the forum (Facchinetti, 2016): for example the construction of the forum adiectum cancelled the 'Domus repubblicana' built on the east side of the forum vetus (Anon, n.d.). Square E 1 and the 'area con fontane' were built on the 'Domus degli Affreschi' rooms overlooking the forum (Anon, n.d.). Square E 2 obliterated part of the western rooms in the 'Domus occidentale', built close to the southwestern sector of the forum during the 1st century BC (Anon, n.d.). Temple C was not necessarily linked to this phenomenon: its modest dimensions and marginal position, even if placed along the cardo maximus, suggest that it was not involved in the general building frenzy that aimed at constructing remarkable public buildings in the forum area, which in turn required the acquisition, and in some case the expropriation, of private property. Considering the temple's poor state of preservation, the lack of decorative elements and the absence of epigraphic documentation, we cannot identify the deity to whom it was dedicated. In any case, the temple's dimensions and the careful renovation of Domus B seems to indicate that it could have belonged to a collegium: in fact, its similarities, both structural and topographical, with the temple of the fabri tignarii in Ostia (Anon, n.d.) have already been recognised. Therefore, the temple may have been built by a collegium or a private individual connected to it, most probably a member of the local elite (about which see in general (Cafaro, 2022). In this regard, the mosaic with navalia (par. 10.2), can suggest that the wealth of the owner of Domus B derived from maritime trade and/or shipbuilding. Albeit more than a century had passed since the construction of the domus, it seems at least intriguing to suppose a link between a professional association of traders or shipbuilders and one of the members of the family which formerly owned the domus from the late Republic. Perhaps even the individual who promoted the construction of the temple belonged to a collegium or was a patron of the association and donated the space and/or built the temple at his own expense. The stratigraphy of the temple complex, directly covered by agricultural layers, does not allow us to reconstruct its phases and identify the moment of its decommissioning. This structure, like the adjacent ones, is indeed only preserved at the level of its foundation, due to the intensive spoliation of building material that affected the area from Late Antiquity up to modern times, and also to the agricultural works in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the excavations which involved the southern area of Domus B with the porticus surrounding the temple, and those in the area between the Domus A and Domus B, allow us to frame the final phase of the structure within the town's historical context. In the area to the south of Domus B, an accumulation of ceramic sherds for drainage attributable to the Byzantine period has been identified. It covered the southern perimeter wall of Domus B, which was affected by spoliation. The porticus of the temple rested on this perimeter wall up to its foundation. The northern wall of the porticus instead reused the perimeter wall separating Domus A and Domus B. The former presents traces of a fire (remains of burnt and collapsed roof beams on atrium A3) that can be dated to the last decades of the 4th century AD, probably resulting from the earthquake that has been documented in several areas in the town. In general, collapsed structures linked to a seismic event followed by fires have been identified along the southern sector of the decumanus maximus: the earthquake is documented, for example, in the house known as 'del piccolo dolio', which presents traces of fire and of the first floor collapsing onto the ground floor (Anon, n.d.). Relevant evidence, even though less marked, is also present in the 'Domus di Oceano', whose destruction its materials seem to date to the end of the 4th century AD (Anon, n.d.). The honorary base of the Consularis Tusciae et Umbriae Lucilius Constantius, datable to after AD 366 and probably placed in the Capitolium, is the latest document of an intervention in the public and religious areas of the town (Anon, n.d.), which should not have been of particular interest in the late 4th century AD. In fact, a little further north, the rubble of the Great Temple was found in a fallen position and not removed after the earthquake, with the columns of the eastern portico all collapsed in the same direction. Most probably, even the removal of the marble pavement in the forum area and of other architectural elements was connected with this crisis (Anon, n.d.). Returning to the area of 'Porta Marina', the perimeter wall common to Domus A and Domus B, which constituted the north side of the temple's porticus, was stripped to the foundation, like its southern analogue, except in the western sector. In this latter sector, in fact, the wall was preserved and a small round cistern was built on it: it belonged to a workshop, most probably for washing fabrics, installed on Domus A around the mid-5th century AD. (Fig. 10.4B). This workshop included a large pool that reused the enlarged impluvium of Domus A (Anon, n.d.). The marble slabs used to extend the surface area of the impluvium may have come from the paving of Temple C or its access staircase. Therefore, we can assume that materials were recovered from the porticus wall to be employed in the construction of the workshop once the temple had lost its sacral function. On the other hand, the search for building material does seem to have involved either 10. Lunae: new perspectives from recent archaeological fieldwork the temple's plinth (whose foundation was brought to light intact) or the internal structure of the porticus. Most probably, the base of the temple was still used as a dwelling, shelter or otherwise, so that the surrounding space was not affected by the spoliation operations that affected the perimeter wall. From the late 4th century AD onwards, the disinterest in the town's public and religious buildings became tangible. At this time, a bath likely related to the nearby 'Domus dei Mosaici' was built reusing part of the north branch of the porticus of the Capitolium, thus closing off access to the sacred area from that side. The bath was built precisely by reusing fragments of architectural decoration and statues recovered from the dismantling of the public area (Anon, n.d.). At the same time or a few decades later, the 'Domus dei Mosaici' was restructured: it came to occupy areas previously belonging to public buildings (such as the basilica and the porticus around the Capitolium) and featured the conspicuous mosaic representing the Circus Maximus (Anon, n.d.). In the last decades of the 4th century AD the 'Domus di Oceano' (Fig. 10.6A) was still being endowed with a series of large and well decorated rooms, including a hall connected to an exedra with a balustrade and a room with masonry benches along three sides (Anon, n.d.). Next to the hall with an exedra, another large hall was later built, characterised by a poorer pavement and connected to a smaller room (Anon, n.d.). The entire complex (apsidal hall, room with benches, smaller room) was still in use in the late 4th to early 5th century AD, as indicated by numismatic evidence (Anon, n.d.): it may have been a domus ecclesiae in use between the earthquake which damaged the domus and the construction of the first church of Lunae in the 5th century AD (Anon, n.d.). In this church the plinths of the columns reused marble bases probably removed from the triporticus surrounding the Capitolium: one of these bases, dated to the second half of the 4th century AD, provides a terminus post quem for the construction of the church (Anon, n.d.), a chronology confirmed by the materials found in the abandonment layers of the domus (Anon, n.d.). The general situation documented in Lunae, together with the stratigraphy of our excavations, allows us to hypothesise a decline in interest and a progressive abandonment of Temple C during the 4th century AD. This event was certainly influenced both by the Christianisation process (a diocese is attested at Lunae in the 5th century (Anon, n.d.) and by the Theodosian edict of AD 380 (Anon, n.d.). Most probably, Temple C, like the adjacent Domus A, suffered damage during the earthquake that occurred at the end of the 4th century AD and, like the other religious buildings in the town, was not repaired, its space being repurposed with part of its building materials being reused (as indicated by the excavation results). From at least the mid-5th century AD onwards, the town organised its political and religious structures around the bishop's chair: the construction of the Byzantine fortress, which would enclose all the religious buildings between the late 6th and the early 7th century AD (Anon, n.d.), sanctioned the definitive deconstruction of the Roman town's plan. Simonetta (Anon, n.d.) In conclusion, the town's urban evolution can thus be outlined in a diachronic perspective, even though we must admit that our knowledge of Lunae remains partial: we are only informed about the top of society, that is the group most associated with public buildings and the remarkable domus. Throughout the Roman period much of the Lunae's society continues to escape us: not only the dwellings of the first colonists, but also later middle-class houses are yet to be identified. Even so, the restudy of the published documentation identified a specimen of a small house near the western gate featuring an upper floor in opus craticium (Anon, n.d.). This may well represent the first clue that a less elite quarter may have been located in the western sector of Lunae, crossed by the minor cardo that connected the town with its port system through the south gate (i.e. 'porta sud' on Fig. 10.1). Furthermore, we now need to look for Lunae beyond its town walls: as it is often the case in Roman towns, the urban settlement further extended outside the colonial walls. In the north sector, immediately west of the northern gate, the Great Baths building (featuring two piscinae, many rooms and opus sectile floors) was brought to light in the late 19th century and then reburied for preservation. In the eastern sector, apart from the amphitheatre built along the sideway of the via Aurelia Nova in the 1st-2nd centuries AD, some structures have been partially excavated, whereas investigations in the western sector have offered very limited results. Moreover, at the moment there is no evidence for reconstructing the harbour system with, presumably, its horrea, all the facilities necessary for the handling of the marble, and the scholae of the various collegia, some of which are epigraphically attested (fabri tignarii: CIL XI 1355; dendrophori: CIL XI 1355; centonarii: CIL XI 1354; Cafaro 2022). In conclusion we hope that our project, which include systematic GPR (Adriano Ribolini, University of Pisa) and aerial photography campaigns (Giuseepe Ceraudo and Veronica Ferrari, University of Salento: (Anon, 2022), will very soon provide new data about Lunae's urban development, inside and outside its walls. Chapter 11 Interamna Lirenas: how special? Many ancient towns have enjoyed a long life, often reaching well beyond Antiquity. When this has happened, it has been primarily on account of the continued relevance they enjoyed as the world around them changed. Many, however, failed to keep up with such transformations and were eventually abandoned, never to be occupied again. While the memory of their former existence began to fade, some of them acquired a new purpose as vast sources of building materials ready to be extracted and (re)used elsewhere: the more accessible the site, the more systematic, thorough, and prolonged these 'extractive activities' turned out to be. Once this had ceased, debris was spread over to level the ground and many of these sites were eventually reclaimed for agriculture ('greenfield sites'). The site of an ancient town is often given away by the enduring presence of some notable ruins, usually associated with those monumental features which are indicative of its original status. Interamna Lirenas (Southern Lazio, Central Italy) is one Roman town, which, on the other hand, disappeared almost completely from sight (Fig. 11.1), its memory mostly preserved in the modern name of the area (Contrada Termine, today part of the Municipality of Pignataro Interamna). By the time modern scholarship began to take a more systematic interest in it, it offered such an underwhelming spectacle that archaeologists were quickly convinced of its early decline and fundamentally backwater character (par. 11.2). However, as it has been the case for several other 'greenfield sites' (e.g. Falerii Novi: Millett, this volume; Septempeda: Vermeulen, this volume), since 2010 our understanding of Interamna has been profoundly affected by the systematic and extensive application of non-destructive archaeological techniques, particularly geophysical prospection and the study of the plough soil assemblage (Anon, 2023), enhanced by targeted excavations (Anon, n.d.)(Bellini et al., 2017)(Bellini et al., 2018)(Bellini et al., 2019)(Bellini et al., 2020)(Ballantyne et al., 2015)(Ballantyne et al., 2016)(Goddard et al., 2022)(Anon, n.d.). This approach has since revealed an urban plan sprawling over 24 ha 11. Interamna Lirenas: how special? and featuring a hitherto unknown level of urban complexity. Furthermore, it has produced clear evidence of sustained growth from the mid-Republican to early Imperial period, with no real signs of either contraction or decline until the later part of the 3rd century AD. If these discoveries have prompted a specific reconsideration of the archaeology of this town, their implications are in fact broader. As it will be shown, the historical trajectory of Interamna appears to have significantly diverged from traditional narratives about the development of Roman Italy in the Imperial period, long-assumed to have been characterised by stagnation and decline (e.g. (Anon, 1997)(Anon, n.d.). Therefore, the problem is whether Interamna should be considered a special case in Antiquity (i.e. representative of itself only) or rather an average community in Roman Italy whose nature and trajectory have been more comprehensively revealed by archaeology than it is usually the case. This chapter will thus provide an overview of the results of 13 years of archaeological fieldwork at Interamna, and how these may contribute to a reappraisal of the longterm development of Roman urbanism in Italy. The site of Interamna Lirenas occupies a southern spur of a river terrace in the middle of the Liri Valley, a fundamental route of communication across Central Italy in any period. About 1 km long, roughly triangular in shape, the spur is oriented northwest-southeast and extends towards the meandering course of the River Liri (ancient Liris), only few hundred metres away. Flat on top, it features rather marked slopes on its sides (especially the southwestern one) and towers over the plain below from a relative height of 30 m (60 m a.s.l.). Gifted with a well defensible site, Interamna was placed at a strategic crossroad in the landscape (Fig. 11.2): the via Latina, which constituted the main axis of the urban settlement, here approached the course of the Liri (navigable at the time), where it was joined by a road running along the valley bottom (from the northwest, today corresponding to the Strada Provinciale 45) and another one crossing over the river itself (to the south), before further proceeding to the southeast (towards Teanum, in Campania) (Anon, n.d.). The site represented a bridgehead along the left bank of the river Liri and lay within a territory which, in the latter part of the 4th and the early 3rd centuries BC, was crucially involved in the confrontation between Romans and Samnites. Such character is well reflected in the available textual evidence, which for long has represented the main source of information about Interamna (Anon, n.d.). Ancient authors mentioned Interamna in passing, primarily due to its participation in broader events of the Republican period: its foundation as a Latin colony in 312 BC in the context of the Samnite Wars (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.); its role as a (wavering) ally of Rome during the Second Punic War (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.); the Triumviral settlement of veterans in its territory (Anon, n.d.). By the time of the Principate, Interamna had comprehensively ceased to play any part in the main narrative of Roman history and, as such, it disappeared from it. Epigraphic evidence partly compensated for this lack of information, even though it projected the image of a town soon bypassed by the main road network (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), and which, albeit acting as a venue for local periodical markets (Inscriptiones Italiae 13.2.49-50), may have struggled financially such as to require direct supervision from a curator rei publicae at the turn of the 3rd century AD (CIL X 4860). After all, Interamna is notably absent from the relevant sections of both the Tabula Peutingeriana (Segmentum V) and the Itinerarium Antonini (Anon, n.d.). Besides, we are told that an otherwise 'collapsing' bath complex was maintained and kept in operation only thanks to generous benefactions from members of the gens Sentia (M. Sentius Crispinus and M. Sentius Redemptus) between the 3rd/4th and the early 5th centuries AD (CIL X 5348-5349). Considering the scarcity of visible material remains across the site, it should not surprise that the first modern archaeological studies of Interamna tended to see it flourish in the Republican period, only to begin a process of inexorable decline soon afterwards. Michelangelo Cagiano de Azevedo (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), implicitly subscribing to a long-established view that interpreted colonies as propugnacula imperii (Cic. Leg. agr. 2.27), linked the fortunes of Interamna to the military and strategic role it played while Rome was consolidating its hold over Italy. According to Filippo (Anon, n.d.) the centre was eventually 'absorbed' by nearby Aquinum, likely becoming one of its vici. The first systematic analysis of the plough soil assemblage over the urban area, carried out by Canadian archaeologists in 1978-83 and primarily focussed on the distribution of fineware and amphorae potsherds, appeared to confirm these interpretations: the area of occupation would have peaked (c. 30 ha) around the late 2nd to early 1st centuries BC, only to have shrunk dramatically (c. 10 ha) by the 1st century AD, and even further later on (Anon, n.d.). The obvious contrast between Interamna and its neighbouring towns in terms of archaeological remains ('city walls are not definitely attested at Interamna, which also lacks theatre and amphitheatre') and surviving inscriptions ('Interamna has only one quarter to one fifth of the number found in the town and territories of Aquinum and Casinum') only reinforced this view (Anon, n.d.). Admittedly, one dissonant interpretation was put forward by Gaetano (Anon, n.d.), a local scholar whose own analysis of the plough soil assemblage dated the peak of urban occupation to the Imperial period (dismissed by (Anon, n.d.). What made Interamna Lirenas so unpromising and somewhat underwhelming is exactly what brought our team from the University of Cambridge to Contrada Termine. Looking for a 'greenfield site' where to pursue the non-destructive survey approaches that had been successfully applied in the Tiber Valley and elsewhere (Millett, 2013)(Keay & Millett, 2016), we were drawn there by the ideal conditions the site offered for both geophysical prospection (almost unencumbered by later buildings and comprehensively accessible) and systematic surface collections (fields being periodically ploughed with optimal visibility) (Anon, n.d.). After all, notwithstanding its possible decline in the Imperial period, early modern wanderers had indeed recorded the presence of numerous ruins across the site (Anon, 1814)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), with some of the paved streets being still visible (and in use!) in the 1940s (Cagiano de (Anon, n.d.). If Interamna had indeed experienced an early decline as previous scholarship had argued, it would have still presented a rare opportunity to map a Republican urban layout little affected by later developments (an almost 'closed context', akin to Fregellae: Diosono, this volume). However, there were already good reasons to believe that this may have not been the case. First, just outside town, downhill from the main settlement, next to a likely crossing over the River Liri, stood the remains of a large room in opus listatum/ vittatum, featuring a groin vault and two apses. Known locally as 'Dogana Vecchia', it was badly damaged during the Second World War and only the lower part is still preserved today. Notwithstanding the lack of any specific features normally found in association with bath complexes (e.g. tubuli, suspensurae), Cagiano de Azevedo (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) was minded to interpret this structure as what was left of the building repeatedly restored by the gens Sentia (par 11.2), taking it as an indicator of Interamna's flourishing between the end of the 4th and the beginning of the 5th century AD. But this late vitality, not impossible after a prolonged period of decline, clearly contrasted with the results of the Canadian survey (par 11.2). As it happens, a quick reanalysis of the Canadian dataset highlighted possible flaws in its original interpretation, somewhat misrepresenting the widespread presence of early -and even late -Imperial finds across the site (Anon, n.d.). These preliminary considerations convinced us that a systematic reappraisal of the archaeology of Interamna was indeed fully warranted. While a full-coverage geophysical prospection may have well revealed the (still-buried) urban layout, we were also aware that knowledge of commonware pottery had very much improved since the 1980s. Due to their local/regional distribution, commonwares were likely to 11. Interamna Lirenas: how special? provide more reliable evidence of occupation compared to finewares and amphorae, whose access/supply had been significantly affected over time by their increasingly overseas origin (Anon, n.d.). To further enhance these activities, we carried out a systematic field survey in the surrounding territory (2010-14: preliminary results discussed in (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) and launched a series of targeted excavations around the forum. The extent of the surface scatters in the plough soil provided a good indication of the (maximum) extent of the urban area of Interamna Lirenas. Except for a group of houses located at the northwestern and southeastern ends of the spur (Masseria Cardillo and Masseria Morra respectively), the rest of the site consisted of a series of open agricultural fields, whose easy accessibility made it possible to carry out a full-coverage geophysical prospection of the site (24.3 ha in total) with both fluxgate gradiometry and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The fluxgate gradiometry and the initial targeted application of (Anon, n.d.) were carried out in collaboration with the British School at Rome (BSR) and the Archaeological Prospection Services of Southampton University (APSS), under the supervision of Sophie Hay. The main GPR survey was carried out in partnership with Lieven Verdonck and Frank Vermeulen from Ghent University (2015-17), part of a larger project involving similar work at the site of Falerii Novi as well (Anon, n.d.). The results of all these activities have been comprehensively presented and thoroughly discussed in a recent monograph (Anon, n.d.). The following discussion will draw attention to some relevant features of the ancient town which the geophysical prospection has revealed (Plate 11.1). One of the most striking aspects of the town is certainly its dense occupation. Except for some marginal sectors featuring few (if any) geophysical anomalies interpreted as buried structures, the built area is generally packed with a wide array of private and public units. Most domestic units (84%) tend to be relatively small (190 x House I: <500 m 2 ), but are widely interspersed with fewer larger ones (25 x House II: 500-1,000 m 2 ; 5 x House III: > 1,000 m 2 ), thus showing no noticeable sign of zoning or separation according to social status (a pattern which is well-attested at those Roman towns, like Pompeii and Herculaneum, whose plan is comprehensively known: Wallace-Hadrill 1994, 75-78). Furthermore, a series of 19 sizable 'courtyard buildings', mostly located at a distance from the forum, may represent service structures (horrea, macella, scholae) as well as apartment blocks (or indeed both, especially if they had featured an upper floor). A preliminary comparison with the new plan of Falerii Novi (Anon, n.d.) is proving helpful. Even though the intramural area of Interamna (c. 23 ha) was considerably smaller than that of Falerii (c. 31 ha), it did harbour a much larger proportion of smaller domestic units (House I) and about six times the number of 'courtyard buildings', possibly indicating a higher population density and an even larger population overall. Although its higher population density (90 inhabitants/ha) may have represented a response to spatial constraints imposed by the topography, it is in fact more or less in line with independent estimates which have been put forward for Roman urban settlement of middling size (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In short, from a demographic point of view, Interamna appears to have been hardly special. However, one of the problems with this kind of population estimates is that they tend to refer to the 'peak' of occupation, invariably assuming the entirety of the urban area to have been comprehensively occupied at some point in time. This lack of chronological/spatial dimension is admittedly problematic but can be effectively balanced out with a systematic study of the plough soil assemblage (e.g. (Vaccaro, 2013). Taking the spread of well-dated commonware pottery to provide a reliable diachronic indication of occupation levels across the site (par. 11.3.1), it was possible to map how the urban area of Interamna may have developed in the Roman period (Anon, n.d.). Its initial occupation appears to have been rather limited, clustered around the forum area and few satellites spots within the plateau (possibly involving as few as 200 families out of an initial colonial contingent of 4,000). This may be explained by considering that a larger number of colonists than normally assumed may have been settled in the ager (Anon, n.d.). Besides, the nefarious impact of the Samnite siege (294 BC) and the passage of Hannibal's army (211 BC) must have seriously disrupted the development of the Latin colony in its crucial, initial phase (Anon, n.d.). But the situation began to improve soon afterwards, and urban occupation may have indeed reached its maximum extent by the 1st century BC (as originally argued by (Anon, n.d.). However, this trend continued until the early 3rd century AD, with a population likely peaking in the 1st-2nd centuries AD (Anon, n.d.). This trajectory appears to defy traditional expectations about Interamna -and many other towns in mid-Imperial Italy. This requires some explanation, particularly in consideration of the apparent sidelining of this community as indicated by the later course of the via Latina (established in the Augustan period (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), which effectively bypassed Interamna, in favour of a more direct link between Aquinum and Casinum (a situation later reflected in both the Tabula Peutingeriana and the Itinerarium Antonini) (par. 11.2). If the later course of the via Latina undoubtedly provided a more expedient route for long-distance journeys through the Liri Valley (i.e. the kind of travel which itineraria were arguably for), this does not imply that the existing communication network had ceased to exist. On the contrary, large and important centres like Aquinum (Anon, n.d.) and Casinum may have relied on this secondary network to further connect with the rest of the valley and, most importantly, the River Liri itself. After all, if the Emperor Claudius had indeed considered redirecting the waters from the Fucine Lake into the Liri not only to reclaim good agricultural land, but also to make it even more navigable (Anon, n.d.), it stands to reason that the river represented a very important waterway across that part of Central Italy, linked with the important port of (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The spread of commonware potsherds by period over the urban area of Interamna Lirenas (as modelled in (Anon, n.d.). the Mediterranean (Anon, n.d.). If one considers this extended and integrated communication network, the place of Interamna acquires renewed centrality: not only it was the only town located along the course of the Liri between Fabrateria Nova and Minturnae, but it was well connected to both Aquinum (earlier route of the via Latina) and Casinum (road leading northwards, today known as 'Via Vecchia Esperia', and passing on the bridge over the Rio Spalla Bassa, the socalled 'Ponte del Diavolo: Fig. 11.1). These considerations may go some way towards explaining the considerable presence of those 'courtyard buildings' which, as it has been suggested, may have represented apartment blocks as well as horrea, or even macella (see above; see Plate 11.1). If their number appears excessive for a middling town like Interamna, it would be much more explicable had the town represented a trade hub within the valley, in service to larger centres like Aquinum and Casinum. That Interamna played such a crucial role is indicated by the fact that its name features in two separate lists of periodical market venues (nundinae), meaning that it likely acted as a link between two (largely independent) regional market circuits, the only town in the Liri Valley known to have done so (Anon, n.d.). A large open space (c. 0.5 ha) at its southeastern end has been interpreted as a forum pecuarium (Anon, n.d.). This likely played a part in the wool trade, which represented a fundamental resource across the region more generally, and at Interamna specifically (Anon, n.d.). More recently, Interamna's direct link with the river has found further confirmation thanks to a GPR survey of the area of 'Dogana Vecchia' (Fig. 11.1), near the present course of the Liri (Launaro & Verdonck forthcoming). The preliminary interpretation of the geophysical anomalies has revealed the presence of a temple (whose remains may have been seen by (Anon, 1814)(Anon, 1814): 42), a possible bath complex (distinct from the remains which Cagiano interpreted as such), and -more significantly -a sizable horreum. All things considered, these structures likely formed part of the river port of Interamna, whose main period of operation (as tentatively indicated by the plough soil assemblage) is currently attested between the late 1st century BC and the 4th century AD. By intercepting -and enabling -an intense traffic between the centres of Aquinum and Casinum to the north and Minturane and the Tyrrhenian coast to the southeast, Interamna likely offered a diverse range of opportunities to many, something which may well explain its population levels and dense occupation over a prolonged period (2nd century BC to 3rd century AD). Remarkably, the scale and significance of these activities would be completely lost were we to exclusively rely on the presence of finewares and amphorae imported from overseas (Anon, n.d.). Interamna was thus a lively node in a local/regional network which the town supported and -no less importantly -benefitted from. Without this awareness, it would be impossible to explain the hitherto unknown urban monumental character as revealed by the geophysical prospection. Two intramural sanctuaries dominated the lower plain and the course of the Liri to the southeast, their position consonant with a Hellenistic architectural tradition well-attested both in Italy and abroad (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Similarly, along the northwestern side of the town, a roofed theatre (Anon, n.d.) towered over an open terrace (an elegant garden?), enhancing its visibility from the road running on the parallel spur immediately to the northeast (today Strada Provinciale 152). Remarkably, notwithstanding the relevance of the via Latina as the backbone of the urban layout, the town's most impressive public buildings were located away from it, invariably facing outwards, as if to convey a sense of the opulence and success of that community to those approaching it from any side (Anon, n.d.). But Interamna did not merely offer a spectacle to outsiders: at least one secure macellum and three bath complexes served its own population. Of the latter group, the largest one is likely the one maintained and renovated by members of the gens Sentia (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Conditions may have significantly changed from the 3rd century AD onwards, involving a significant if gradual reduction of both the urban area (Fig. 11.3) and the underlying population, a process apparently mirrored in the countryside (Anon, n.d.). Nevertheless, that the town continued to exist as a civic centre of some relevance well into the 5th century AD is indicated by that late act of euergetism from a wealthy patronus (M. Sentius Redemptus, in AD 408). This represents a rather unusual case among the towns of southern Latium in this period (Anon, n.d.), made even more remarkable by the fact that, although the gens Sentia was probably from Atina (Anon, n.d.), they had clear interests at Interamna. One cannot but wonder if Interamna's privileged relationship with the River Liri, an important waterway whose existence did not require the same level of maintenance or investment as the road network clearly did, may have had a part in slowing down and delaying the town's decline and abandonment (Anon, n.d.). Since 2013, guided by the results of the geophysical prospection, targeted excavations around the forum area have brought to light a series of public buildings and some remarkable epigraphic evidence whose nature and chronology have significantly added to our understanding of Interamna Lirenas and its development. But geophysical prospection did not merely identify the most promising sectors in which to open our trenches. It rather provided invaluable information about both their immediate and broader context, making it possible to widen the reach of our interpretation in ways that would not be possible in the absence of such (detailed) data about what it is still buried (and invisible). The earliest well-dated structures brought to light belong to a porticus built in the early 2nd century BC, which was eventually razed to make room for the theatre towards the end of the 1st century BC (Bellini et al., 2019). A small section of the covered walkway (featuring a width of c. 6 m) was uncovered underneath the postscaenium of the theatre (Fig. 11.4). It likely extended further in both directions, its continuation to the Southwest having been entirely removed (including foundations) when the (lower) cavea was excavated. It is defined by two linear parallel structures in opus quadratum (local travertine): the one to the northwest was open, featuring descending steps and a series of columns/pilasters (as indicated by their foundations), whereas the one to the southeast corresponded to a perimeter wall which closed the building on that side. Whatever complex it may have been originally part of, the porticus was located quite centrally, but notably away from both the via Latina and the forum, along the northeastern limit of the settlement. This situation strikingly resonates with the one already recorded for the intramural sanctuaries (and their likely porticus) which have been identified along the southwestern edge of town (Anon, n.d.). An adaptation of the Greek stoa, the porticus was being adopted by Roman architecture at about the same time, especially in its more 'functional' versions closely associated with trade and other business activities (Anon, n.d.). But precocious examples of this architectural type were to be found outside Rome too, notably at Minturnae, where a porticus duplex (190-174 BC) was built along the via Appia, immediately outside the western gate of the original castrum 11. Interamna Lirenas: how special? (Anon, n.d.). What may have acted as the model for the porticus at Interamna is less relevant than its early date, which is contemporaneous with precocious developments elsewhere. Besides, a preliminary study of the early (Republican) phase of the basilica (see below) recorded same building technique and materials as those employed in the porticus (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), thus suggesting that both buildings may have formed part of a contemporary monumental development. All things considered, whatever the actual scale of the troubles experienced by Interamna during the 3rd century BC, this community had begun to flourish soon after the end of the Second Punic War, likely seizing the unprecedented opportunities that the conquest of the Mediterranean offered to both Romans and their Italian allies. The next major urban transformation took place between the end of the 1st century BC and the early decades of the 1st century AD. Hardly a surprising outcome when considering the development of Roman urbanism in Italy (Anon, n.d.), this discovery actually defied traditional expectations about Interamna, a town long assumed to have been already declining by the beginning of that period (par. 11.2). Building activities associated with this phase tend to feature same techniques (mainly opus reticulatum, complemented with opus testaceum) and building materials (cubilia made of local travertine). The earlier basilica at the northern corner of the forum was demolished to (and largely including) foundation level, being replaced by a new structure (c. 26 × 19 m) (Fig. 11.5) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). This building presented a rather standard plan, whose internal layout was defined by a series of 14 columns. The excavation confirmed these columns to have been made of bricks and decorated with a thick layer of stucco featuring 24 flutes (as typical of the Ionic/Corinthian order which was popular at the time). The sector immediately to the north of the forum underwent an even more significant redevelopment: two insulae were merged (by closing off the road running behind the basilica), earlier buildings were knocked down (including a porticus: see above) and a large terrace was created (supported by a solid retaining wall: (Anon, n.d.). The resulting platform was then occupied by a theatre (c. 55 × 31 m), whose cavea was contained within a rectangular roofed hall (c. 45 m × 26 m) (Bellini et al., 2017)(Anon, n.d.). Roofed theatres, albeit not unknown in Italy, did represent a relatively rare occurrence (in general (Anon, n.d.). Acoustically better performing than their more traditional, open-air counterpart, they presented their own structural challenges (in general (Anon, 1993). It certainly made sense to advertise the clear monumental ambition of this project (and the notable wealth which had made it possible) by giving it pride of place on a purpose-built stage (the terrace): anyone traveling along the alternative route of the via Latina few hundred metres away would have linked this with the ambition and resources of the citizens of Interamna -and of their wealthy and powerful patroni too. What the excavation has brought to light mirrors what else we have since learned about the place which Interamna occupied within a political network which extended across the region, including Rome. Not only a reappraisal of a well-known inscription has confirmed that Julius Caesar had been patronus municipi in 46 BC, but the excavations themselves have uncovered new epigraphic evidence that matches and enhances our renewed narrative of the development of the town (Launaro & Patterson, 2020). A member of the local gens Novia (M. Novius Tubula) likely began a senatorial career by being elected as a plebeian tribune in the time of Augustus, celebrating this achievement by donating an inscribed sundial to its hometown. The construction of the theatre itself likely benefitted from the generosity of a wealthy freedman of the Sulpicii Galbae, a certain Anoptes, whose name may have featured on the frons scaenae itself. The fact that the interests of this powerful and wealthy family primarily concentrated along the coast between Terracina and Puteoli, passing through Minturnae, provides a suggestive indication of the place which Interamna occupied within the political and economic geography of the region between the late Republican and early Imperial periods. What the excavation reveals about later phases is heavily affected by significant post-abandonment disruptions. Dating any development to the mid-to-late Imperial period is thus rather challenging. The basilica certainly received a new concrete floor, 11. Interamna Lirenas: how special? but the associated stratigraphy has not yet revealed an absolute chronology for this intervention. The frons scaenae of the theatre was certainly transformed at a later period, with the addition of elements in opus testaceum whose characteristics (e.g. the increased thickness of the layer of mortar) may find some correspondence with examples dated to the 3rd century AD (Anon, n.d.). That the theatre was still in operation in this period (and possibly after) seems indicated by the fact that M. Sentius Crispinus had been awarded the honour of a bisellium (double seat at the theatre) at some point between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD (par. 11.2). On the other hand, the excavation has been quite informative about the postabandonment phase. In line with earlier interpretations, it seems likely that the increased level of disruption, conflict and general insecurity associated with the Greco-Gothic War (AD 535-554), and not experienced in the area since the time of Hannibal, had prompted the last remaining inhabitants to abandon the town, probably already deserted by the time of the Lombard invasion of the late 6th century AD (Anon, n.d.). The earliest archaeological sign of abandonment may indeed be represented by some skeletal remains radiocarbon dated to 588-704 cal AD at 83.8% probability (LTL21908 -1381+45BP). These belonged to a 30/40-year-old woman, whose burial cut through what was left of the marble floor of a building of uncertain function located at the southwestern corner of the forum (Anon, n.d.). Additional juvenile burials are attested at this spot, one of which has been radiocarbon dated to 994-1155 cal AD at 95.4% probability (LTL20241A -977±40 bp) (Anon, n.d.). These latter activities may well have taken place at the time when the theatre was undergoing a systematic and thorough process of spoliation (as indicated by the presence of few fragments of ceramica a bande rosse tentatively dated to the 10th-12th centuries AD). This process is attested across the trenches more generally and resulted in a large quantity of debris being accumulated everywhere. Later on, this material was spread over: the area was levelled by filling any hollows (e.g. the theatre's cavea) so as to create an even surface suitable for arable agriculture (although few remains of modest height must have remained partly visible across the plateau). Our understanding of Interamna Lirenas has profoundly changed. Whether our insights can be used to develop any more general consideration about the development of towns in Roman Italy depends on how representative we consider this case to be. Interamna's trajectory for the period up to and including the 1st century AD now hardly stands out compared to our expectations for most other Italian towns over the same period. Clear signs of expansion in the 2nd century BC and, even more so, in the time of Augustus and the early Imperial period, are well-known phenomena. The significance of Caesar's patronage of Interamna in 46 BC should not be overstated: although only three other towns are currently known to have boasted such privilege (Alba Fucens, Bovianum and Vibo Valentia), significantly more probably did so (Caesar needed to consolidate his network of political support as widely and thoroughly as possible across Italy, especially at such a critical time). What really defies expectation is the lack of visible crisis and the apparent continuity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Again, this is not unheard of (Anon, n.d.), but it is something which we would have remained ignorant about Interamna had it not been for the study of commonware pottery as evidence of local/regional networks. That Italy and its towns had been experiencing a precocious crisis during the 2nd century AD, somewhat prefiguring and anticipating the more general crisis of the 3rd century AD, has been predicated on a very specific interpretation of the earlier period. For a long time, the success (and wealth) of Italian communities in the late Republican period has been attributed to their elites' ability to fully exploit the unprecedented business opportunities resulting from a combination of most favourable market conditions across the Mediterranean and the widespread availability of (cheap) slave labour. This would have led to the development of an intensive agricultural system centred on cash crops (wine, olive oil) and so closely reliant on such specific conditions as to be fundamentally inflexible (i.e. the so-called 'villa economy': (Launaro, 2015). As such it could have not survived the maturation of the empire and the rise of the provinces (less favourable market conditions), let alone the decline in the supply of the essential slave labour (as the empire stabilised and military campaigns became much rarer) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The crisis of Italian agriculture and overseas exports could not but have a negative feedback effect on the wealth of the Italian landed elite and their ability to invest and take a direct interest in towns and their communities. On the other hand, Italian towns would have been effectively sidelined as the flow of trade and wealth between Italy and the rest of the Mediterranean had fundamentally changed. In other words, the success of Italy and its towns has for long been understood as a function of its participation in long-distance Mediterranean trade. However, it is precisely this emphasis which is probably unwarranted. It has been shown that overseas demand for the products of such an intensive, export-oriented, slave-based agriculture was relatively limited even at its peak (Anon, n.d.). Thanks in no little part to the wealth generated by military campaign overseas and the varied range of business opportunities which they had created, the Roman and Italian elites took on themselves to invest in their towns, triggering a process which turned Italy into one of the most urbanized regions in the Roman world (Anon, n.d.). The supply of this growing urban demand (including -but not limited to -Rome) likely came to represent a solid and vast market for Italian agriculture, largely independent of changing patterns across the empire. Given the variety and fragmentation of the Italian landscape, an integrated communication network must have played an effective and essential role in guaranteeing a comprehensive supply of these communities (especially when located further away from the coast, and thus less likely to be able to intercept the flow of provincial goods to Rome). The local and regional nature of these networks may well explain their limited archaeological visibility if only (imported) finewares and amphorae are considered diagnostic (Bellini et al., 2019). All things considered, Interamna was never 'special'. Between the late Republican and early Imperial period, it enjoyed that same growth that is attested at many other Italian towns. On the other hand, its unexpected continuity in the mid-Imperial period may reflect conditions that were much more widespread across Italy than traditionally acknowledged. What, if anything, makes this site somewhat special is how comprehensively its archaeology has been revealed (Anon, n.d.): none of the approaches, methodologies and techniques employed there are new, but their systematic combination and scale of application have allowed a remarkably holistic (re)appraisal of a Roman town in Italy. This research has indeed shown the immense informative potential of 'greenfield sites', even those -like Interamna -which may look the most underwhelming on the surface. It is precisely their marked accessibility and, therefore, suitability for the application of a wide array of extensive survey techniques and approaches which holds the greatest potential. Indeed, more integrated studies like this one will hopefully follow, expanding our dataset of Roman towns -both in Italy and beyond -whose plan and full range of material culture are comprehensively known and understood. A town and its road: Aeclanum on the via Appia Ben Russell & Girolamo F. De Simone Aeclanum lies in the district of ancient Hirpinia, a hilly region that still to this day constitutes a key corridor across the southern Apennines between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic coasts of the Italian peninsula (Fig. 12.1). Hirpinia was gradually brought under Roman control following the construction of the via Appia through its heart in the 290s BC and the establishment of the colony at Beneventum, on its northern fringes, in 268 BC (on the Hirpini: Poccetti 2021). The earliest material culture recovered at Aeclanum dates to before this, perhaps as early as the 5th century BC, though we have only limited evidence for the character of the site prior to the 1st century BC. By this date, Aeclanum had certainly developed into an urban centre with a wall circuit. Following its capture by Sulla in 89 BC it became a Roman municipium and was later integrated into the Regio II Apulia et Calabria, as the westernmost town in the region. Aeclanum was promoted to colonial status relatively late, under Hadrian in AD 120 (as Colonia Aelia Augusta Aeclanum), and finally developed into an important Christian bishopric between the 4th and 7th centuries AD. The site of Aeclanum covers c. 21 ha and the centre of this is now protected as a parco archeologico in Passo di Mirabella, within the territory of the Municipality of Mirabella Eclano (which preserves the name of the ancient town). Standing remains of substantial structures are still visible on site, though much of the town remains unexcavated. In 2016, new excavations and survey work at the site were initiated as a collaboration between the Apolline Project, the University of Edinburgh, the Soprintendenza Archeologica, Belle Arti e Paesaggio per le Province di Salerno e Avellino and the Comune di Mirabella Eclano, in association with the British School at Rome. This paper will examine what the work at Aeclanum since 2016 reveals about the urban topography of the town and its development and relative prosperity over the longue durée. The via Appia has a key role to play in this story, but so too does the position of the town in its wider landscape: Aeclanum owed its prominence not to its size but its location, as an interconnected road station and the centre of a thriving 12. A town and its road: Aeclanum on the via Appia local territory (see Fig. 12.2). Aeclanum lay directly on the via Appia. Cicero stayed in the town twice while travelling along the Appia (Att. 7.3; 16.2), and it is listed on the Antonine Itinerary and shown on the Tabula Peutingeriana. The road brought a steady flow of people through the town, travellers' requirements providing opportunities for local businesses. The road also made Aeclanum a commercial hub for its wider territory and the most visible, and visited, centre in the local landscape. It attracted the attention of local elites keen to make their beneficence visible in the urban core, where everyone passing along the via Appia could witness it. As a result, Aeclanum has a monumentality and epigraphic record disproportionate to its relatively small size (Evangelisti, 2017)(Anon, n.d.). The Apennine mountain range presents a longstanding challenge for travel across the Italian peninsula. From the broad ager Campanus and the plains around Vesuvius, two primary routes are available across the Apennines. The first of these is through the treacherous Furculae Caudinae, which were used by the via Appia. The second is a narrow mountain pass leading toward Abellinum, which is utilised by the modern motorway. Beyond the formidable limestone peaks of Taburno, Partenio, and the Picentini mountains, the topography is characterised by the rivers Sabato, Calore, Ufita, and Ofanto, which create valleys and many low hills, with a scattering of a few rocky peaks impeding efficient travelling. Located between the valleys of the rivers Calore and Ufita is Aeclanum. To the east of the town the landscape is dominated by the Daunian mountains, an irregularly shaped chain of hills and low mountains (on average c. 1000 m a.s.l.), and by the extinct volcano Vulture, before the land opens up to the extensive plains of Puglia. In the Roman period an intricate system of roads developed to connect the two coasts of the Italian peninsula and facilitate travel across this difficult landscape. The town of Beneventum served as a primary transport hub in the west of the region. The town was a pivotal point on the via Appia, which then proceeds towards the southeast, passing through Aeclanum before reaching Venusia, on the edge of the plain (Fig. 12.1). The via Traiana, a later addition to the network, originated in Beneventum and was directed towards the northeast, passing through Aequum Tuticum before reaching Herdonia, again situated on the plain (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The remaining 12. A town and its road: Aeclanum on the via Appia components of the network consisted of secondary roads, which ran between the via Appia and the via Traiana and connected key settlements, such as the via Herdonitana, which connected Aeclanum to Herdonia, and the via Aemilia, linking Aequum Tuticum to Forum Aemilii. Within this road network, Aeclanum was the largest town after Beneventum, from which it could be reached within two days by oxcart. The town was also well connected to several secondary routes, including a well-known drovers' path for sheep (Anon, n.d.)). Aeclanum's territory probably covered a sizeable portion of the territory southeast of Beneventum. The Liber Coloniarum (1.210.4-6 L; 2.261.5-8 L) reports the assignment of centuriae of 240 iugera (c. 60 ha), with a module of 20 × 24 actus, probably connected to the establishment of a colony under Hadrian. Based on aerial photographs and cartography, a sizeable centuriation grid (27° NE) of c. 15,200 ha between the rivers Calore and Ufita has been identified (Fig. 12.2; Ditaranto 2017). These centuriae probably only encompass a fraction of the territory of Aeclanum, which potentially reached as far as the River Calore to the west, or even beyond. This hypothesis is reinforced by the identification of material culture and pottery fabrics found in Taurasi, to the west, indicating close ties to Aeclanum rather than Abellinum. Under such circumstances, the territory of Aeclanum might have spanned 19,000-32,000 ha. The clay hills of this region, interlayered with volcanic debris and carved by the rivers, were perhaps as fertile in antiquity as they are today. Currently grain and vineyards cover most of the land, while olive groves are also present; forests in the territory continue to be exploited for timber, while oxen and sheep still play a prominent cultural role. While the archaeological evidence remains incomplete, it nevertheless aligns with this picture and suggests that the area achieved a measure of self-sufficiency in terms of agricultural output. Prior to the 1st century BC, we know little about the settlement at Aeclanum, and it is unclear whether the via Appia was constructed to pass through a pre-existing foundation or whether the presence of the road encouraged occupation of the site. A small sanctuary of Mefitis just to the north of the town was probably active in the 2nd century BC and several Oscan inscriptions can be associated with it (Sgobbo, 1930)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Little has been found in the area of the town itself, however, other than some scattered pottery of the 5th century BC (Anon, n.d.). Several architectural terracottas, found near the early Christian basilica at the site, used to be thought to date to the Hellenistic period and so provide evidence for high-end building in this period (Sgobbo, 1930)), but they have recently been redated to the second half of the 1st century BC at the earliest and could be Augustan or later (Frese, 2012). Terracing activity in the Roman period may well have removed early structures at Aeclanum. However, it is also possible that the site only developed an urban character in the late 2nd and 1st centuries BC, paralleling patterns elsewhere in Samnite regions (Anon, n.d.). (Anon, n.d.) notes that there is no mention of Aeclanum in Livy's account of the Hannibalic Wars, suggesting it did not exist or was unimportant. Aeclanum is first mentioned in the historical sources by Appian, who documents Sulla's assault on the town in 89 BC (Anon, n.d.). He tells us that the town had become a focal point of resistance to Sulla, who captured it by burning down its wooden walls. The fact that Aeclanum had a wall circuit, albeit a wooden one, indicates that the site had an urban character at this date. The town was also clearly influential in the region: Sulla makes an example of Aeclanum because he knows other towns in the region will pay attention. The rest of what we know of 1st-century BC Aeclanum comes from the epigraphic record. Despite the punishment meted out by the Sullan forces, the town was immediately made a Roman municipium and inscribed in the Cornelia tribe (unlike most of the region of Hirpinia, which was enrolled in the Galeria tribe (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). This somewhat surprising turnaround in fortunes might be explained by the presence of prominent citizens of Aeclanum on the Sullan side, notably Minatus Magius, the great-grandfather of the historian Velleius Paterculus and a famous general who had raised a legion in Hirpinia in support of Sulla (Vell. Pat. 2.16.1; (Anon, n.d.). In the wake of its sack, Aeclanum experienced a wave of reconstruction, as outlined in four key inscriptions. A dominant player in this process was Gaius Quinctius Valgus, the notorious Sullan supporter (Anon, n.d.) calls him 'Sulla's greedy henchman'), who held various magistracies in towns across Campania, including Casinum and Pompeii, in the aftermath of the civil wars (CIL X 852 = ILS 5627 [Pompeii]; CIL X 5282 = ILLRP 565 (Anon, n.d.)). At Aeclanum he is recorded as patronus municipii (CIL IX 1140-1141 = ILLRP 523 = ILS 5318). This same text tells us that, along with two of the appointed quattuorviri, Valgus paid for the construction of new walls, gates, and towers. These other quattuorviri were Aulus Patlacius and Marcus Magius Syrus, the latter being probably the son of Minatus Magius, mentioned above. The second relevant inscription mentions two other individuals similarly paying for walls and towers as well (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). To these two we can add a third inscription, reused in the walls of Frigento cathedral but probably from Aeclanum, which connects Valgus also to a forum, porticus, curia and cistern (CIL I 2 3191 = ILLRP 598). A final text notes that another quattuorvir, Marcus Palius, paid for another porticus and an arch (CIL I 2 3192 = ILLRP 599). We will return to some of these individuals below. Of the various Late Republican structures mentioned epigraphically the only one that remains visible above ground is the wall circuit (marked on (Anon, n.d.). This encloses an area of just over 21 ha and the construction technique of the walls, where it can be observed, is a crude form of limestone opus reticulatum, which is not inconsistent with a 1st-century BC date (Anon, n.d.). Until recently the 12. A town and its road: Aeclanum on the via Appia forum at Aeclanum -presumably the one mentioned in the inscription above, unless it was moved -was also unknown, but our geophysical survey at the site has now pinpointed a location, as will be discussed below. We know more archaeologically about Aeclanum in the Imperial period. Most of the standing remains still visible at the site (indicated in black on Fig. 12.3) date to the 2nd century AD or later. The bulk of these were uncovered during the systematic and large-scale excavations carried out in the 1950s-60s under the direction of Giovanni Onorato and then in the following decades by Gabriella d'Henry (Anon, 1960)(Pescatori & Giovanni, 1999)(Pescatori, 2017). They include a residential area, comprising at least two large elite houses (the most complete the so-called 'Casa con peristilio': Fig. 12.3: 7), a macellum (Fig. 12.3: 9), bath complex (Fig. 12.3: 1), and the early Christian basilica (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Industrial structures, including a kiln and a glass workshop, were added to the residential area in Late Antiquity (Anon, n.d.). More recently, excavations along the via Appia to the southeast of the town have uncovered several suburban buildings and tombs (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), as well as extensive Roman and Late Antique cemeteries (Pilato, 2005)(Anon, 2015). In 2005 significant work was carried out in and around the early Christian basilica (Pilato, 2010). And between 2006 and 2009, excavations at the entrance to the archaeological park also discovered various public structures (Fig. (Anon, n.d.), tentatively identified as part of a porticus and a nymphaeum and assumed therefore to be connected to the forum. Behind the façade of the presumed nymphaeum was found a headless imperial statue, thought originally to be Marcus Aurelius but now published as Domitian, as well as a series of marble architectural elements dating to the Julio-Claudian period (Anon, 2013)(Avagliano, 2017)(Anon, n.d.). Despite considerable excavation at the site up to 2009, there remained significant gaps in our knowledge of the urban topography of Aeclanum prior to the start of the current project. The exact course of the via Appia through the town had not been verified through archaeology (assumed course (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The layout of the wider street network had also not been clarified. The precise locations of the forum, of any temples or larger entertainment structuressuch as theatre or amphitheatre -were also unknown. Of the structures partially uncovered during excavation, several were of uncertain function: the supposed porticus and nymphaeum complex uncovered in 2006-09, for example, and the series of rooms comprising the lower story of a building with apsidal wall adjacent to the baths (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Other structures, while their function was apparent, had unclear layouts or chronological phasing and required further investigation. Work at Aeclanum between 2016 and 2019 concentrated on a combination of targeted excavation and larger scale geophysical survey. The latter focused on three zones of the town, with a view to connecting areas of earlier interventions and understanding how the street system and built environment interacted with the unusual topography of the town (Strapazzon et al., 2017). Trenches were opened in four sectors, where it was thought stratified deposits could be uncovered and the phasing of structures revealed: 1. Sector A (Fig. (Anon, n.d.): the area of the structures previously described as a porticus and nymphaeum close to the entrance to the archaeological park, which we were able to identify as the location of the town's theatre (Trenches 1 and 5). 2. Sector B (Fig. 12.3: 1-3): the northern area of the town, where the baths excavated by Onorato are located and which we refer to as the 'North Baths' of the town (Trenches 2-4 and 7), as well as the area to the west of these where the line of a major roadway was visible on the geophysics (Trench 12). 3. Sector C (Fig. (Anon, n.d.): the residential zone in the centre of the town, next to the modern site office, where the early Christian basilica has been excavated (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.): the central-southern district, where the macellum was located and the geophysics now enables the identification of both the forum and a series of residential blocks stretching to the west (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Understanding the urban layout of Aeclanum is complicated by the site's topography. The town occupies the point at which a spur of land projects westwards from the main northwest-southeast ridge along which the via Appia ran in antiquity. The northeastern half of the town is constructed along the top of this northwest-southeast ridge, while the southern part of the town occupies the westward spur (Fig. 12.4). The northwestern quarter of the town, in contrast, drops away sharply. A number of long terrace walls must have been constructed in the Roman period to ensure that the public structures built up on the top of the two ridges did not slide down the hill to the northwest. Substantial terracing can still be noticed on the site along the western side of the North Baths and the central residential sector, across which the early Christian basilica was constructed (marked on Plate 12.1). A series of at least seven large buttress walls were also added to the western side of the North Baths to mitigate slippage. A further terrace wall of some description must have run roughly east-west along the northern side of the westward projecting spur that dominates the southern half of the town (marked as a dashed line on Plate 12.1). Indeed, a series of barrel vaults that are perhaps part of such a terrace are preserved in the farmhouse close to the westernmost tip of the town. A terrace wall very likely also ran between the area of the North Baths and the central residential sector, but no traces of it survive. GPR survey of 890 m 2 of this area in 2016 identified evidence of substantial erosion, perhaps a landslide resulting from the collapse of this wall (Anon, n.d.). The ends of walls can be seen on the geophysical results in this area, but their full extent cannot be determined (Fig. 12.3). GPR transects carried out over the lower, northwestern portion of the town in 2017 also failed to identify any structures in this area of the town, which seems to have been covered by several metres of soil eroded from the upper terraces of the site. That there certainly were structures on at least part of this lower terrace is confirmed by excavations in 2005 to the west of the early Christian basilica, where the walls of a domus with painted wall plaster were uncovered (Anon, n.d.). Currently, however, we can reconstruct little of the urban plan in this part of the town and it is even possible that parts of the steep hillside here were never built on. In the upper part of the town, especially in the northern, central, and southern districts, the GPR survey was considerably more productive. In the northern area (Sector B), the GPR helped to clarify the arrangement of the structure(s) to the east and south of the North Baths (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). This complex was excavated by Onorato and probably dates to the 2nd century AD; it is the largest bathhouse in the town identified to date, covering an area of c. 1,400 m 2 . To the east of the main rooms of the bathing complex the GPR indicated that there are no further structures, but rather an open space, perhaps a palaestra. The GPR also helped to make sense of the series of small rooms originally excavated by Onorato to the south of the baths, which are probably of the same date (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Considering the topography of the site and the geophysical results it is now clear that these rooms comprise the basement story of a larger complex with a substantial apse at the centre of its western wall. At the level of the story above these small rooms the complex extended eastwards, like the baths, via an open space towards a pair of parallel north-south features, c. 5 m apart. This is evidently a second public building, with a substantial two-story building at its western end and an open porticus, in total measuring 64 × 39 m (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). We have previously proposed that this was a cultic complex or possibly a gymnasium, given the proximity of the baths (Simone & Russell, 2018). The parallel north-south features to the east of the two complexes described above mark the foundations of a porticus, a fact confirmed by the excavations in Trench 12 12. A town and its road: Aeclanum on the via Appia (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). This porticus ran alongside the western side of a major north-south road, identified by the GPR survey and excavated in Trench 12. The North Baths and the public building to the south of it presumably faced on to this road. The alignment and width of the road, and the presence of the porticus running along its western side, strongly suggest that this is the via Appia. Where exposed in Trench 12, the road had been stripped of its paving, but a substantial stone-built drain, its vaulted covering still intact, ran along its western edge, immediately in front of the portico (Anon, n.d.). The line of this road can be traced on the GPR as far as the northeastern corner of the excavated residential sector. Here the GPR showed an area with a more irregular street network, which has been heavily damaged by deep ploughing (Anon, n.d.). The carpark of the archaeological park also reduced the legibility of the results in this area, though to the northwest of the structures identified in 2006-09 as a porticus and nymphaeum (Fig. (Anon, n.d.), walls could be identified. A pair of parallel, curved walls with cross walls connecting them could be made out on the geophysics. Excavations in this area have since shown that the westernmost of these correspond to the outer wall of the cavea of a theatre, the stage building of which corresponds to the structure previously identified as a nymphaeum -the alternating aediculae and niches exposed in 2006-09 correspond to the façade of the proscenium. The architectural elements from this building, published already in 2013 and 2015, can be dated to the Julio-Claudian period (Anon, 2013)(Mesisca, 2015) and the complex seems to have remained in use until the 4th century AD (Anon, n.d.). To judge from its plan, and especially the area of its cavea (c. 784 m 2 ), the theatre was probably designed to accommodate at least 2,200 people. The line of the via Appia could be traced as far as the rear of the theatre, where it either continued to the south or turned towards the southeast. The most detailed GPR results came from the southern half of the town, in the area to the west of the macellum (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). This is the highest point in the town and seems to have been its civic core. Just to the west of the macellum, the GPR revealed a large open space, 28 × 75 m long (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). A test trench on the western edge of this space showed that this was originally a paved area, though the paving has since been stripped, leaving just the preparation surface behind. Such a large paved area can only be the forum of Aeclanum. The macellum opens off the eastern side of the forum and can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century AD. It has an interesting form, with a circular internal courtyard ringed by rooms; the closest parallels are from Herdonia and Alba Fucens and are of similar date (Anon, 1983)(Russell & Simone, 2020). To the south of the macellum the GPR results reveal a probable road, flanked by a porticus to the east of it, which delineates the rest of the eastern side of the forum; this might be where traffic left the forum to join back on to the via Appia. A corresponding road seems to have run the full length of the western side of the forum. Along the southern edge of the forum, meanwhile, one side of a rectilinear building, at least as long (east-west) as the forum is wide, with an interior colonnade, is visible (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). This could be a further porticus or an enclosed public building, perhaps a basilica. The southern half of this complex lies under the modern access road that runs east-west through the site. To the west of the forum, five evenly sized insulae were revealed. The first of these contained a small number of large buildings. The most northerly of these, which has two apsidal rooms, was probably a public bathhouse (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). If a praefurnium excavated in Trench 6 at the north end of this insula (which was originally interpreted as part of a domestic bath) was connected to these public baths, then this was a substantial complex, measuring c. 28 × 56 m. South of this is a rectangular structure broken up into smaller units by thin walls, perhaps foundation walls (Fig. (Anon, n.d.); the location of this structure would suggest either a civic or perhaps a commercial function (shops or a horreum?). One of the late Republican inscriptions noted above mentions a curia and this would be a logical location for it, but no certain identification can be posited on the basis of the GPR alone. 12. A town and its road: Aeclanum on the via Appia The next insula to the west contains a series of smaller structures. The southern half of the insula contains a building comprising a series of small rooms around a courtyard; those on the east side measure 4 × 5.5 m. This might represent a horreum or other storage or commercial building, comparable to the horrea identified at Interamna Lirenas on the basis of the geophysical survey there (Anon, n.d.). The structures in the northern half of this insula appear to be smaller units, perhaps houses or commercial structures. The third insula to the west of the forum contains a series of buildings of similarly uncertain function, though their arrangement suggests they are not public buildings. More can be said about the fourth and fifth insulae to the west of the forum. No remains were identified in the GPR in the northern parts of these insulae. This is probably because the terracing structures over which the early Christian basilica was built, just to the north, turned to the west in this area, to align with the barrel vaults described above, which are further west. If this is correct then a substantial change in elevation probably occurred two-thirds of the way through these insulae, the original ground surface dropping away in those areas where the GPR results trail off. Some of the buildings in this part of the town seem to have been large and might even have had a public function: a large building with a courtyard and apse visible in the southeast corner of the fourth block to the west of the forum is particularly noteworthy (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). In 2019, Trench 16 was opened to test the GPR results in this southern sector of the town (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). An inner room of a large residence, filled by multiple phases of collapse, was exposed. Fragments of painted plaster in the collapse suggest this was a high-end domus, while the ceramics show it was probably destroyed by the earthquake of AD 346. It was impossible to expose the full height of the walls, but at a depth of 3 m the top of an arch was exposed, suggesting the walls continued further down. The discussion above reveals how much our understanding of the urban plan of Aeclanum has improved since 2016. Excavations across the site have also added chronological depth to this picture, in particular with regard to Late Antique developments. The AD 346 earthquake mentioned above appears to have been keenly felt at Aeclanum and ushered in an era of redevelopment (on this earthquake more generally: (Galadini & Galli, 2004). Unlike other towns in the region, in fact, Aeclanum seems to have generally prospered in the 4th and 5th centuries, at least up until AD 472, when ash from the so-called 'Pollena eruption' of Vesuvius blanketed the town. The bulk of our stratigraphic information from the excavation undertaken between 2016 and 2019 dates to the period AD 346-472. This evidence has been discussed in detail elsewhere (Simone & Russell, 2019)(Castaldo et al., 2023), but some of the salient features of Late Antique Aeclanum bear repeating here. The impact of the AD 346 earthquake was detected archaeologically in all of the sectors of Aeclanum investigated via excavation. However, the response to the devastation varied across the site. Several buildings excavated were evidently destroyed in AD 346 and never rebuilt; they lay as ruins or piles of rubble. This was the case with the building -perhaps a house or commercial structure -uncovered in Trench 8, to the east of the previously excavated residential sector (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). This building had collapsed suddenly, its wall caving in before the roof fell on it (Simone & Russell, 2018). The elite house explored in Trench 16, as noted above, also never seems to have been rebuilt after the middle of the 4th century AD and might be connected to the earthquake of AD 346. Two large public buildings that were not abandoned after AD 346, but which did change function, are the theatre and the macellum. The theatre was certainly no longer in use and was in the process of being spoliated when ash from the AD 472 eruption fell on Aeclanum (on the ash found during excavation: Colucci Pescatori 2017, 174). How long before this date it had stopped to function as a theatre, however, is indicated by the discovery of domestic occupation layers in the substructures of the cavea (those identified by the GPR survey, mentioned above; Fig. (Anon, n.d.). The ceramics in these layers indicate that at least by the first half of the 5th century AD the substructures of the cavea were being lived in, and it is possible that the building stopped functioning as a theatre proper before this time (Anon, n.d.). This picture is partly replicated in the macellum, where most of the structure seems to have been given over to domestic units after the 4th century AD (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), with occupation lasting even after AD 472 to judge from the ceramics (Castaldo et al., 2023). Just a single room in the northwest corner of the complex seems to have still acted as a commercial space, perhaps butcher's shop (Anon, n.d.). Alongside signs of abandonment and the shifting functions of buildings, there is also evidence for renewed investment and reconstruction at Aeclanum. The North Baths were a major recipient of this investment. New marble floors and mosaics were laid out in the 4th or 5th century AD and a new pool was added to one side of the frigidarium. Another structure that seems to have been reconfigured and restored in this period is the large 'Casa con peristilio' in the centre of the town (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). Excavations in 2019 here showed that several of the walls were rebuilt with reused brick and tile in the late Roman period (Russell & Simone, 2020) and this restoration work might well have been connected to the building of the new Christian basilica adjacent to the domus (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). This new church, in fact, was built over the intersection of the streets beyond the southwestern corner of the house; its walls probably abutted those of the house. As Lo Pilato has noted (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), the road to the west of the 'Casa con peristilio' was blocked off by a wall in this later period and she has suggested that these developments were part of the creation of a sort of 'insula episcopalis', centred on the new church in the town. If this is correct, then it is likely that the 'Casa con peristilio' was a key part of this new ecclesiastical core. New geophysical survey and excavation work at Aeclanum has helped to flesh out the urban plan of the site, even if very significant gaps remain. We now know where the via Appia entered and (approximately) left the town as well as much of its likely route through the site (Plate 12.1). The key late Republican and Imperial-era public buildings were aligned along a central spine, determined both by the topography of the site and the presence of the via Appia. Moving from north to south, a visitor passing along the via Appia would have encountered the North Baths and the public complex adjacent to them (on their right) then the theatre (on their left). It is probable that heavy, wheeled traffic would have turned to the southeast at the theatre -in order to bypass the forum -but anyone continuing further south would have found the macellum, a second set of baths, and probably the usual array of other civic buildings. We know little about the southeastern corner of Aeclanum, but the line of the via Appia can be traced via older excavations out of the town in that direction. Substantial terracing was required to produce level ground on which these various public structures were constructed. The result was that, while the monumental façade of Aeclanum was oriented primarily inwards, towards traffic along the via Appia, this string of public buildings would also have dominated the skyline when viewed from the valleys to the east and, especially, to the west of the town, where the Calore River ran (Fig. 12.2). The town and its key public monuments, therefore, would have been visible from much of its territory. Aeclanum was never a large urban centre. At just over 21 ha, it lies on the cusp between de Ligt's categories of 'small town' (<20 ha) and 'medium town' (20-40 ha) (Anon, n.d.). If we consider Aeclanum within the wider context of the Augustan Regiones I-II and perform a rank-size analysis, the town can be grouped with Fabrateria Nova, Acerrae, and Herdonia (<26 ha), while Telesia, Suessa, Minturnae (26-45 ha), Beneventum, and Neapolis (46-85 ha), and the large centres of Aquinum and Teanum Sidicinum (86-150 ha), can be grouped together in larger size rankings. For context, these can be compared to Ostia (154 ha), Capua (182 ha), and Rome (1,270 ha). If we take a subregional perspective, however, in the 750,000 ha centred on Aeclanum, the largest towns were Beneventum (46 ha) and Venusia (44 ha), with Aeclanum, Abellinum, and Herdonia acting as mid-rank centres (Fig. 12.1). Much smaller towns (such as Aequum Tuticum and Compsa) as well as smaller settlements and mansiones were interspersed between these centres. From this more focused perspective, Aeclanum was an important centre for a wide, lightly urbanised territory. Calculating the exact population of Aeclanum is complicated by the fact that we simply have no idea what proportion of the town was occupied by housing. The domestic structures identified to date are largely elite domus and we have little information about where ordinary citizens lived. It seems probable that many of the insulae to the south of the forum contained housing, but we do not know whether the northwest area of the town was densely occupied or not; here the slope of the hillside now ranges between 13.5% and 15%. Despite uncertainties about the size of the inhabited area, we can estimate the urban population using density calculations derived from studies of Roman urban demography. Hanson shows that most studies of pre-industrial urbanism have identified typical population densities of between 100 and 500 inhabitants/ha (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), with smaller towns tending to be less densely occupied. Hanson therefore proposes using a value of 100 inhabitants/ha for urban centres under 50 ha (Anon, n.d.). Millett has argued for 90-110 inhabitant/ha on the basis of the geophysical results at Falerii Novi (Anon, n.d.), while a slightly higher average of 150 inhabitants/ha is used by (Anon, n.d.) in his analysis of central and southern Italy. If we take the area of Aeclanum as 21 ha, a density of 100-150 inhabitants/ha would result in a population of c. 2,100-3,150. If the steeply sloping northwestern part of the town was not occupied, we could reduce the overall area to 18 ha, resulting in a population of 1,800-2,700. Given the topography of the site, and the fact that some of it was probably not densely occupied, therefore, a population of c. 2,100 seems most plausible. Despite its small size, Aeclanum was evidently a wealthy centre. Its public buildings were lavishly decorated with imported marble, which, given the location of the town in the centre of the Italian peninsula, implies serious investment of capital. This is most apparent in the theatre (on the marble of which: (Anon, 2013)(Mesisca, 2015), but the macellum and the North Baths also features marble revetment and flooring (Astolfi et al., 2023). The site has also produced substantial quantities of statuary, including marble images of numerous emperors and members of the local elite (Avagliano, 2021). Perhaps the most striking testament to the status of the town is its epigraphy. The number of inscriptions from the site -over 530 -is comparable to the total from much larger centres in the region and further south, such as Beneventum and Brundisium (Anon, n.d.). In a local context, it is particularly noteworthy that Aeclanum has produced roughly three times the number of inscriptions as Abellinum (a town that had become a colony over 200 years earlier) and far more 2nd-3rd-century AD inscriptions, in particular, are known from Aeclanum than Abellinum (Anon, n.d.). Strikingly, investment in Aeclanum continued into Late Antiquity, when the town maintained the status it had enjoyed earlier. After the 3rd century AD, new investments came primarily via the correctores, the governors of Apulia et Calabria. But one final flourish of civic investment was provided, probably in the aftermath of the AD 346 earthquake, by one Umbonius Mannachius, who was honoured as patronus and fabricator ex maxima parte etiam civitatis nostrae (CIL IX 1362). New investment can be traced archaeologically on the site and fits into a wider pattern. We can compare the work carried out on the North Baths in the 4th century AD, for example, with the rebuilding of baths at other sites in central Italy in this period, largely funded 12. A town and its road: Aeclanum on the via Appia by governors (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). At nearby Herdonia the baths underwent a similar transformation at this date (Leone et al., 2009)(Anon, n.d.), while those at Venusia were expanded in the 4th century AD (Anon, n.d.). Despite these parallels, in its immediate vicinity, there are notable differences between the changes apparent at Aeclanum after AD 346 and those at Abellinum (Anon, n.d.). At the latter, the baths never seem to have reopened after the AD 346 earthquake, while the large domus close to the town walls was broken up into smaller units, themselves mostly abandoned by AD 472 (Anon, n.d.). While the new ecclesiastical centre at Aeclanum grew up in the heart of the town, not far from the old forum, at Abellinum -as at Nola, to give a further example (Anon, 2003)) -religious life shifted outside the town to the church at Capo La Torre (Anon, n.d.). Where Aeclanum became an important bishopric in southern Italy -producing the controversial Julian of Aeclanum in the early 5th century AD and sending a bishop to the Council of Constantinople as late as AD 536 (Anon, n.d.)) -Abellinum struggled. Aeclanum was seemingly a town that punched above its weight in terms of its public architecture and epigraphy. Where did this wealth come from? The presence of the via Appia must explain some of this. To some extent we might view Aeclanum as a town projected towards passing travellers. The North Baths and those to the west of the forum, visible on the GPR, were conveniently located, close to the line of the via Appia, similarly to many mansiones (Medri, 2016). Beyond these public buildings, travellers would have required accommodation, food and drink, entertainment, and other transport-related services. Beyond its role as a road station, most of the wealth in the town probably derived from its territory and especially its local elites. The prominence of the latter in the late Republican period has already been noted above. Minatus Magius had the influence and capital to raise a legion for Sulla in the 1st century BC, and his son was a prominent quattuorvir. While Gaius Quinctius Valgus invested heavily in the urban fabric of Aeclanum in the same period, he also seems to have benefitted from Sullan land confiscations to build up substantial estates in Hirpinia. This is a key point of Cicero's de Lege Agraria Contra Rullum (Anon, n.d.), in 63 BC, in which he claims (presumably with a degree of exaggeration) that Gaius Quinctius Valgus, Publius Servilius Rullus' fatherin-law, owned most of Hirpinia. Aeclanum also produced prominent members of the equestrian and senatorial classes in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, as demonstrated by inscriptions from the site (Evangelisti, 2014)(Anon, n.d.). Members of these families held magistracies and invested their money in the town and were rewarded for their efforts with public honours. They presumably had large estates in the area around Aeclanum, like Valgus had before them. This was a territory rich in timber, well-suited to all cultivations, and the raising of livestock. Aeclanum, while small, was a key central place in the wider region and highly visible; it was here that the members of the local elite invested their capital in order to ensure their own prominence in the monuments of the town. The size of these monuments, notably the baths but also the theatre -which seems to have been able to seat all of the likely adult urban population, while in other towns theatres generally accommodate about a third to a half (e.g. the theatre of Pompeii seats 3,100 out of a population of c. 9,600 inhabitants) -were presumably designed with the population of the territory in mind, as well as travellers along the via Appia. There are clear parallels between Aeclanum and other 'small towns' on major roads. We can point to Ocriculum in Umbria, for instance. This small town again lay at the centre of a wealthy territory containing villa estates and was noted for its brick production and timber resources (Anon, n.d.). Ocriculum was located both on the via Flaminia and adjacent to the River Tiber. Like Aeclanum, the urban plan of Ocriculum was heavily determined by the topography of the site, with its key public structures aligned on terraces dominating the via Flaminia as it passed through the town (Anon, n.d.). The local elites of the territory invested heavily in Ocriculum despite its small size, as shown by the fact that over 20% of the urban territory is devoted to public monuments and the town has produced a disproportionate quantity of high-end sculpture. A more local parallel is provided by Herdonia, a town of broadly similar size, which owed its Imperial-era prominence to another road, the via Traiana. Like Aeclanum the town prospered from the 2nd century AD and a degree of vitality can be traced into the 4th century AD (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The town again suffered in AD 346 but key structures were rebuilt or repurposed, and signs of ruralization only appear after the end of the 5th century AD (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Fruitful comparison might also be made with cities like Carsulae and Amiternum (recent work (Whitehead, 2004)(Heinzelmann & Buess, 2022), and a range of other small towns in Italy. These small centres, like Aeclanum, prospered primarily due to their location. Despite its sack by Sulla, the construction of the via Traiana in the early 2nd century AD, and the pair of natural disasters that impacted the town in AD 346 and 472 (all events that could have negatively impact the town's development), Aeclanum remained a vital urban centre at the heart of a rich territory for at least six centuries. In the wider region, only Beneventum -which found a new lease of life under Lombard rule -shows greater continuity. Aeclanum was firmly rooted in both its fertile and potentially quite large local territory, populated by wealthy elites and agriculturally self-sufficient, as well as a diverse range of transport connections, the via Appia key among them. The construction of the via Traiana might have led to more long-distance traffic (Brundisium-Rome and vice versa) by-passing Aeclanum, 12. A town and its road: Aeclanum on the via Appia but local and regional traffic would still have relied on the via Appia, while roads like the via Herdonitana bolstered this connectivity. For a town so reliant on its road, it is apt that, when Aeclanum does eventually succumb and cease to function as an urban centre, its ruins are named with respect to their distance along this road. A document from the papacy of Gregory II, in the 8th century AD, describes the site simply as 'civitate diruta XV miliario apud Beneventanam civitatem' (Anon, n.d.). This distance is eventually immortalised in the medieval name for the site: Quintodecimo. Chapter 13 New archaeological perspective on Late Antique Aquileia Patrizia Basso Late Antiquity represents a crucial moment for the study of urban landscapes: the 4th and above all the 5th c. AD witnessed the decline of a long-stable empire and the onset of new historical processes that would lead to profound change, even to the physiognomy of the town. This was the result of the wars and the profound political and economic crisis that marked those years, but it was probably also linked to the period's decisive changes in the natural environment. Urban transformation in Late Antiquity will be approached in this essay through a privileged case, namely the town of Aquileia, near modern Udine, which in that period played a major political, military, and economic role. In those years, the town was a grand metropolis, the capital of Venetia et Histria, as well as the checkpoint on Italy's northeastern border and a supply point for the troops engaged on the limes. Therefore, it was an important Late Antique node for commercial traffic, as it had always been in previous phases of its history. 1 In particular, in this paper I will present the results of an archaeological research project begun by the University of Verona in 2018, under my direction, in a field located in a southeastern sector of the town called, after its ancient owners, 'ex Fondo Pasqualis' (Plate 13.1). 2 Although our work is still ongoing, the excavation has already revealed very interesting data about the town in Late Antiquity -not just about the 4th century AD, a period, as is well known, of great vitality, but also about the lesser-known 5th century AD. 3 In order to better understand these results, it would be useful to briefly contextualise our excavation in the historical and topographic framework of the town. As Livy writes (39. 55. (Anon, n.d.), the colony at Aquileia was founded in 181 BC, after 12,000 Gauls invaded the border area between the respective territories of the Venetians, Gauls, and Istrians, where there had been a settlement since the 11th century BC and in particular a commercial emporium active between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC (Anon, 1988)(Chiabà, 2009)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2022). Like the pre-Roman centre, the new colony had a marked commercial character due to its geographical position, open to the Orient and the Mediterranean via the Adriatic but also to the Balkans and Continental Europe (Anon, n.d.). The colony was built in an inland location, linked to the sea by a river about 50 m wide, identified as the Natiso cum Turro mentioned by Pliny (Anon, n.d.). Its right bank was home to a large river port, whose buildings were laid out in the middle of the 1st century AD (Plate 13.1: A). Over time, it grew to include ever-larger warehouses and ramps leading into the urban centre (Carre & Scotti, 2001)(Carre, 2008)(Anon, n.d.). At the end of the 4th century AD, the poet Ausonius celebrated it, along with the town walls, defining Aquileia to be moenibus et portu celeberrima . Other, smaller docks have been hypothesised -thanks to geophysical analyses (Groh 2011) -to have been placed along the canals that surrounded Aquileia on the north and west sides, which would have provided a means of circumnavigating the town (Anon, 2004). Literary sources also emphasise the crucial role of Aquileia as a crossroads of trade, as can be read in a famous passage from Strabo (Anon, n.d.), from the end of the 1st century BC, and in Herodian (Anon, n.d.), from the 3rd century AD. 'Further confirmation comes from the numerous imported materials excavated in urban areas. These provide evidence of exchange not only with the nearby territories of Noricum, Histria and Pannonia but also with northeastern Europe, the Orient, Spain, and North Africa' (Anon, n.d.). 4 In addition to the port, Aquileia was progressively built up in the Republican and Imperial periods with typical public urban monuments, showing the monumental character of the town and its wealth over the centuries (Anon, 2003)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). These works include the earliest town walls (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)) (Plate 13.1: M1 in yellow); the forum with the comitium (Plate 13.1: B), the macellum (Plate 13.1: C) and the basilica (Plate 13.1: D), built at the time of the town's foundation (Anon, 2007)(Anon, n.d.); the Augustan-age theatre (Ghiotto, 2018)(Ghiotto et al., 2020); 2021) (Plate 13.1: E); and the amphitheatre that, based on other excavations I recently directed, dates to the Claudian age (Basso 2018) (Plate 13.1: F). In the 4th century AD, as we will explain in more detail below, the town saw an 'urban revolution' (Anon, n.d.)(Tiussi & Villa, 2019), with the construction of a circus, which was probably built during the Terarchy (Tiussi & Villa, 2018)(Anon, n.d.)) (Plate 13.1: G); the huge thermae from the Constantinian age (Rubinich, 2020)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2021)) (Plate 13.1: H); and the large market we are going to describe. This market, along with its large connected horreum for foodstuffs, constituted the town's new commercial centre despite the fact that the Republican/ Imperial forum was still in use (Anon, n.d.). It functioned throughout the 5th century AD, demonstrating the continuity of the town's role as a hub for travel and commerce in this period. Our excavation area (a surface area of 16,000 square metres) (Plate 13.1 and Fig. 13.1) had already been partially excavated in the 1950s by Giovanni Battista Brusin, then director of the Archaeological Museum of Aquileia, who was actively engaged in urban excavations (Bandelli, 1990)(Cigaina, 2018); https://www.dizionariobiograficodeifriulani. it/brusin-giovanni-battista/). During his work in 'ex Fondo Pasqualis', Brusin identified three paved areas, interpreted as three market buildings, within a large commercial complex, as well as two parallel fortification walls, running along the north bank of the river Natissa, and two rooms with mosaic floors in the southeast corner of the central market (Brusin, 1957); Basso forthcoming). Apart from these mosaics and the eastern market building, which was backfilled due to its poor state of preservation, the structures remain visible today in an archaeological area open to the public, managed by the Fondazione Aquileia (https://www.fondazioneaquileia. it/it/cosa-vedere/fondo-pasqualis-mercati). Before the excavation, we studied Brusin's manuscripts and drawings along with a series of black and white photographs from the archives of the National Archaeological Museum of Aquileia (Basso forthcoming). This material allowed us to see that, despite the large amounts of data gathered during those excavations, many questions remain unanswered about this area. In particular, Brusin was only able to excavate the eastern part of the land, because the owners did not want him to dig up a vineyard on the western side. Another important approach used geophysical surveys. In 2018, Frank Vermeulen and his team (to whom I am very grateful) conducted a magnetometry and a georadar survey of the entire area, revealing some particularly clear anomalies such as a paved area surrounded by pillars located to the west of the structures excavated by Brusin (Anon, n.d.)) (Fig. 13.2). On the basis of these surveys and the archival documentation, in the four archaeological campaigns conducted so far, we have investigated both the walls and the market with the various excavation areas and trenches (Fig. 13.3A: excavation areas 1-5). Also, in order to reconstruct the natural environment, and in particular the course of the river, corings were taken from the south of the area (Fig. 13.3A: S1-S4). We also conducted botanical analyses on samples drawn from the most complete stratigraphic section of the site, in the northern part of the field, as well as C14 analyses and archeozoological analyses, to supplement the data collected by Brusin at a time when such analytical approaches were not applied. In this paper we focus on the Late Antique fortifications and market. However, we briefly mention the earliest structures brought to light by our excavations: some walls and pillars underneath the pavements of the market area and a quay by the bank of the Natissa brought to light at three points in the fortification's sector, from which there were some steps down to the river. The limited extent of the excavations, as well as groundwater that has risen since antiquity, prevent us from understanding these structures. However, even if the evidence is flimsy, it points to an earlier habitation in the area during the 1st-2nd centuries AD, which was unknown before our excavations (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). To study the fortifications, we excavated in three areas: the first between the inner and outer walls already brought to light by Brusin in the southern part of the field; the second further east, along the inner wall; the third near the ex Pasqualis house, where other excavations were conducted in 1993-1996 (Mandruzzato, 1996)(Anon, n.d.). The inner wall was very large (2.40-2.60 m), but only the foundations are preserved, because over time the wall was largely stripped of its stone (Fig. 13.4A). The foundations were constructed using numerous spolia recovered from other urban monuments and burial areas (honorary inscriptions, parts of moulded cornices, columns, funerary inscriptions: Buonopane forthcoming; Grazioli forthcoming). Of particular interest are two statue bases which probably come from the forum: they are dedicated to a senator T. Caesernius Statius Quinctius Macedo Quinctianus, who had a direct link with Emperor Hadrian, given that he was his comes per Orientem et Illyricum (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The wall stood above the quay by the bank of the Natissa, as mentioned above. That meant that the fortification used the river as a further defensive element, which functioned like the ditches that formed an integral part of other urban fortification systems. The section of wall brought to light in our excavation area is topographically linked to many others uncovered in various parts of the town (Plate 13.1: M2, in red) and dated to around the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 4th century AD (Villa, 2004)(Bonetto, 2009)(Anon, n.d.)(Buora, 2016)(Tiussi & Villa, 2019)). As mentioned above, all that remains of this wall are its foundations, so it has never been possible to estimate its elevation. So, we were particularly intrigued when we discovered a collapsed sector of its southern façade (Anon, n.d.). This face, clearly detached from the core, perhaps due to a seismic event or some other violent occurrence, still presents an orderly succession of at least 30 rows of bricks, pebbles, and ashlar blocks. In the northern portion, a small rectangular slit with a semicircular brick ring is still visible 13. New archaeological perspective on Late Antique Aquileia (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). This finding allowed us to estimate that the wall was about 11 m high (Delbarba 2021-22) (Fig. 13.8A). Regarding its dating, Brusin's excavation trenches disrupted the relationship between the stratification and the wall, making it very hard to date. However, materials from the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th centuries AD were collected in the layer that covered the fold of the wall. Diana Dobreva recognised African amphorae (e.g. African IID, the early version of Keay 25.1, Tripolitan II, Ostia IV.263) and common pottery (e.g. the Bierbrauer IIIc olla) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Subsequently, at an as yet undetermined time in the 4th century AD, the Natissa shrank and its course moved further south, where it still runs today. Environmental analyses conducted in Aquileia suggest that the current of the Natissa was less strong toward the end of the 4th century AD. 5 But the movement of the riverbed was probably the result of artificial intervention. Indeed, during our excavation, four corings showed that the bank of the river was moved, carrying over a massive amount of debris (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Although it is too soon to come to any firm conclusions, it seems possible that we can connect these findings to Ammianus Marcellinus's story (21.12.17) that during the siege of the town by Julian in AD 361 the river was diverted with great effort. This intervention had already been hypothesised in the port area, where several towers appear to have been constructed on the western bank of the river, which had evidently been moved before their construction. reduced the width of the river, which, as has already been said, was probably originally around 50 m wide (Anon, n.d.)) (Plate 13.1: TTT2, TTT3, TTT4). A new fortification, built about 12 m south of the inner wall, was much thinner (1.50 m) and was made with a core of irregular stone blocks. Its façade was composed of squared ashlar stones, bonded with abundant mortar (Fig. 13.4B) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The wall was built on the above-mentioned highly inconsistent layer highlighted in the coring. Indeed, its construction required extensive land consolidation. On the southern side of the wall, a series of wooden piles was discovered, while on the northern side another row of wooden piles and some amphorae were brought to light (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). These poles were of oak, the most commonly used timber in the Roman age for public works in a damp environment, due to its robustness and resistance to moisture and xylophagous organisms (Anon, n.d.). Moreover, below the wall, in a deep excavation carried out under very difficult working conditions due to the presence of a lot of rising groundwater, a bed of alder beams was brought 13. New archaeological perspective on Late Antique Aquileia to light (another wood widely used in wet environments) and below that we found a series of vertical poles and amphorae submerged vertically in the soil. Thanks to the amphorae recovered, studied by Diana Dobreva, the outer wall was dated to the first half of the 5th century AD (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The wooden poles, by contrast, are radiocarbon dated to before the amphorae: they were probably recycled from an earlier structure, perhaps related to a previous consolidation of the Natissa's bank. Dendrochronology unfortunately did not yield a more precise dating (Anon, n.d.). Brusin discovered three openings about 2-3 m wide on the excavated wall section, some 25 m apart from each other, one of which he more fully excavated. Our excavation focused on the analysis of another of these openings (the westernmost). At the southern-facing opening, we uncovered a wooden structure, consisting of three parallel beams, at least 1.5 m long and 0.18 m thick, joined to six planks, at most 1.7 m long. At first, the structure was thought to be a pier for the river, but then the thinness of the planks, incompatible with the stresses produced by the weight of men and goods, as well as the fact that the wooden structure was the same width as the opening in the wall, led to the conclusion that this structure was probably a kind of closure system for that opening which had fallen from its original vertical position. The structure was radiocarbon dated (CEDAD-LTL19856A 1689 ± 45 BP, δ 13 C (‰) 27.4 ± 0.4, 238AD (95.4%) 429AD), thus confirming the chronological framing of the wall in the first half of the 5th century AD (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The stratigraphy of this area seems to suggest the presence of a narrow channel that branched off from the river to allow boats to enter the opening to unload goods. To the north of the opening, the excavation revealed a ramp sloping in a northsouth direction, with a slope of about 6-7 degrees, which seems to be connected at the north end with another passage running east-west (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). This was a system for offloading and transporting merchandise from the river to the market. There is no trace of openings for passage of merchandise in the inner wall in our excavated area, due to the later spoliation already mentioned, but a sector of the wall discovered further west than our excavation preserves one opening, about 2 m wide, as we discovered in archival documents (Anon, n.d.). Only a part of the parapets of the ramp remains, consisting of some very large stone blocks (Anon, n.d.). The floor surface is missing, but in front of the opening it seems that it mainly consisted of wooden planks, since we found at least two lines of long iron nails. In the rest of the space, by contrast, the pavement was made of cocciopesto and rebuilt several times, as evidenced by the three surfaces identified (Anon, n.d.). Materials found in all these layers can be dated to the 5th century AD, demonstrating that the ramps and the opening were in use at that time (Anon, n.d.). The frequent restoration of the floor opens new debate over what caused the deterioration of the space between the walls. Perhaps in the 5th century AD the natural environment or climate had changed? Future research and in particular the pollen analyses currently underway may provide the answers. Immediately north of the inner wall, a monumental commercial complex was revealed, consisting of three or four large market buildings, one identified by our excavations and two or three by Brusin (the interpretation of the easternmost building as an additional commercial area remains uncertain, given that Brusin says that it was poorly preserved, without offering further data) (Anon, n.d.). Over several years of excavation, we undertook two excavations to study two market buildings already discovered by (Anon, n.d.).3A: excavation area 2, 5). The complex was unitary, built on a very thick artificial fill, to raise the pavement in response to a rise of the water table. Materials collected in this level are being studied but seem to suggest that the two buildings date from the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century AD (Anon, n.d.). The building here named 3 (Figs 13.3B and 13.7A) consists of a paved square, surrounded by two lines of stone bases with quadrangular holes in their surface, which probably held wooden poles (Anon, n.d.)) that supported a roof or canopy of some other light material, as proposed in the virtual reconstruction (Fig. 13.8B). A water channel runs around the northern sector, suggesting that 'messy' goods that required water, like fish and meat, were sold here. The animal bones found inside the small well located at the centre of this sector also confirm this hypothesis (Bandera forthcoming). The vast majority of these are from cattle, 85.2% of which show signs of butchery. Of particular interest is a scapula with a hole probably intended for suspension by a hook for the sale of the meat. A bear bone is also worth mentioning, possibly attesting to the presence of this animal as well in the diet of the time. Figure 13.8. A: 3D reconstruction of the two walls (Anon, 2021). B: 3D reconstruction of the two market buildings brought to light by (Anon, n.d.) and the horreum (by Nudesign; thanks to Fondazione Aquileia). The building named 2 presents a paved area, surrounded by a portico, which underwent various phases of structural change, as evidenced by the different rows of pillars brought to light by Brusin on the eastern side of the paved area (Anon, n.d.) (Anon, n.d.). Perhaps on either side of the portico was a row of stores, as proposed in the virtual reconstruction (Fig. 13.8B). One particularly important finding uncovered by our excavation (Figs 13.3A: excavation area 2; 13.3B and 13.7C) is a previously undocumented market building (named 1), corresponding to the previously mentioned geophysical anomalies (Anon, n.d.). It was paved by Aurisina stones and in some cases by recycled architectural elements, such as a manhole. A kerb runs along the eastern limit of the paved area, on which are preserved some circular signs that we think were part of a tabula lusoria, where the market customers would have played games. On both sides of the paved area, six quadrangular pillars or reused columns emerged, corresponding to the geophysical anomalies. In our next excavation campaign, we plan to investigate them further. At this phase of the research, we think that this building, too, was surrounded by a portico. To the east, the building was enclosed by a wall (Anon, n.d.). The fact that it is adjacent to the wall that blocks off the western side of building 2 shows that the two buildings (1 and 2) sat side by side (Fig. 13.3B). The north wall of the complex was extensively despoiled over time. What remains, in building 2, is a section of the wall with external reinforcing pilasters, and, in building 1 just the wall's foundation. Between the wall and the paved area, a double entrance was identified, probably intended for chariots (traces remain of wheel ruts in the cocciopesto pavement) and pedestrians (Anon, n.d.). This entrance was directly connected to the road that was discovered immediately north of the wall and that constituted one of the town's decumani (Plate 13.1: I; Fig. 13.3B): the excavation revealed several overlapping layers of pavement preparation starting from the early Imperial age up to the modern age (Anon, n.d.). Excavating the building, we identified a brick channel discharging water outside the complex, probably towards the Natissa, as well as one of the drains where water from the square drained into the channel (Anon, n.d.). Brusin brought to light another similar channel connected to building 3 (Basso forthcoming) (Fig. 13.3B). In future excavations we will try to understand the relationship between this channel and the inner boundary wall. A photograph of Brusin's excavation in the 1950s, in the eastern border of the field, shows that in that portion of the wall there was a further channel that passed through it (Basso forthcoming). This would confirm the close architectonic, and therefore chronological, relationship between the squares and the internal wall. In fact, as has been said, the data gathered so far seem to date both constructions to sometime between the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century AD. Judging from the piles of carbonised seeds found in the layers belonging to the era when a violent fire caused the abandonment of the market, it seems likely that buildings 1 and 2 were reserved for the sale of cereals. Archaeobotanical analyses conducted by Maria Bosco show that these cereals were mostly wheat and spelt and, to a lesser extent, barley and rye (Anon, n.d.). These findings reveal some parts of the diet in this period. The discovery of cereals in buildings 1 and 2 and animal bones in building 3, as it has been said, attests to the differentiation of the commercial areas within a single structural complex. We have not yet identified the east, west, and south perimeter walls of the complex (Fig. 13.3B). In addition, we do not know whether there was a north-south passage between buildings 2 and 3, or some other passages between all the buildings. So, as far as the market is concerned, there is still a lot of work to be done in future digs. However, based on the data so far obtained from excavations, archival research, geophysical surveys, cores, and analyses, our research is tracing a new physiognomy of Late Antique Aquileia, as I will explain in the next section. As mentioned above, the inner wall of our area was part of a large and solid urban fortification (Plate 13.1: M2, in red), built at the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century AD, in order to protect the town but also to strengthen its urban dignitas (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Up to that time the Republican wall (Plate 13.1: M1. in yellow) would have remained in use. In fact, at the time of Maximinus the Thracian and his siege (AD 238) Herodian (8.2-4) described the walls as very old and in parts fallen into ruin (Anon, n.d.). The new wall includes an urban area of about 83 ha, running along the river, which was used as an additional defensive element (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Almost 4,000 m long, the wall is constructed from an enormous amount of building material, probably around 85,000 cubic metres (Anon, n.d.). The costs and difficulties of such an undertaking could perhaps explain the extensive use of spoliated materials observed along the entire perimeter (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Between the Tetrarchy and the Constantinian period, Aquileia witnessed a notable phase of urban monumentalisation, related to the economic and strategic role it played at that time (Tiussi & Villa, 2019). Limiting ourselves to the southeast sector, the above-mentioned great horreum (66 × 88 m) (Plate 13.1: L) was modelled on those of Milan, built by Emperor Maximian: it consists of two large rectangular halls divided into naves by pillars and separated by an uncovered central area (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The discovery of cereals on the floor level testifies to the main use of the complex as a granary, probably intended to supply the army that had to be stationed there because of the threats on Italy's eastern borders (Mandruzzato & Scotti, 1994)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Closely connected to this horreum was the large market that we have been excavating over the past few years, built, like the horreum, at the end of 3rd or the beginning of 4th century AD. This monumental commercial complex is evidence of Aquileia's important economic role during this phase of its history. North of the horreum, the first basilica (Plate 13.1: M) was built in the Costantinian age (to be precise, in the second decade of the 4th century AD) by bishop Theodore (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Novello et al., 2013), 13. New archaeological perspective on Late Antique Aquileia whose name is found in the centre of the magnificently preserved floor mosaics. The construction of these sacred and commercial structures shifts the urban centre of gravity from the forum, the heart of Aquileia in the Republican and Imperial periods, to this southwestern part of the town. The area was still extremely vital in the first half of the 5th century AD, when a new fortification was built, probably at the behest of Theodosius II, who at that time controlled the fragile empire of the very young Valentinian III. The wall enclosed only the southern sector of Aquileia to protect this new centre of gravity of its urban life (Anon, n.d.); forthcoming) (Plate 13.1: M3, in green). For Aquileia, those years were difficult, not just because of internal politics, which saw the clash between Valentinian III and the usurper John, killed in the circus of the town (Procop. Vand. 1.3.9), but also because of the external threats from the Goths and a few years later from the Huns, which resulted in the conquest of the urban centre in AD 452. This second wall functioned as an ante-mural of the other, if we judge by examples from the eastern area of the Empire, particularly from Constantinople (Anon, 2021)(Anon, n.d.). The presence of openings in this wall, which would have been related to a system of ramps identified between the two fortifications thanks to our excavation, attests to the close relationship that still existed between the river and the great market, with goods arriving along the Natissa and then being transported to the points of sale. In these years the abovementioned eastern port was probably replaced by new docks along the river in the southern sector of the town (Anon, n.d.). Throughout the 5th century AD, and therefore even after the siege by Attila, the market maintained its economic vitality (Anon, n.d.). In fact, the material evidence from that period, studied by Diana Dobreva, shows that Aquileia was fully integrated into the Mediterranean trade network: the ceramics found in urban excavations dating to the second half of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th century AD are 84% amphorae, which attest to the importation of foodstuffs (oil, wine, and garum), and also fine tableware and oil lamps. The origins are mainly African but also Aegean and micro-Asian with a small percentage (2%) of ceramics of Southern Italic origin (Anon, 2021)(Anon, n.d.). Many coins were found, as is typical in a commercial area, and most date from the 4th and 5th centuries AD. But what was exceptional was the discovery of a gold solid of Leo I, the first to be found at Aquileia. This finding attests to the circulation of precious metal coins on site in the second half of the 5th century AD and is extremely important evidence for market attendance. 6 Finally, the vitality of the area in this period is demonstrated by two floor mosaics identified by Brusin in the southeast corner of building 3, dated to the middle of the 5th century AD, although we do not yet know how exactly they fit into the broader context (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The abandonment of the markets occurred in the first decades of the 6th century AD, when a violent fire caused the roof of the portico to collapse. The date is suggested by the materials uncovered in these layers and by radiocarbon dating carried out on some abovementioned cereal caryopses (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2021). The ramp discovered between the two boundary walls and used for the transport of goods from the rivers to the commercial squares, also fell into disuse in this period (Anon, n.d.). In Aquileia, the poor evidence from the middle of the 6th century AD suggests a clear change in the function of the town during the Lombard period, when it gradually lost importance compared to the new centres of power such as Cividale del Friuli and later Udine. However, our research shows that people frequented the area even after the abandonment of the market. From the southeast to the northeast corner of building 1, excavations revealed a cut in the paving stones stratigraphically datable to between the second half of the 6th and the 7th century AD (Fig. 13.7C). Numerous postholes observed at the bottom suggest that this was the location of an enclosure or fence (Anon, n.d.). But we will have to excavate the other half of the structure to get a better idea. The presence of a number of graves, some of which Brusin discovered, attests to later frequentations. During our excavations, we identified five inhumations, without grave goods, splitting the stones of the Late Antique paved square. Dated between the 8th and 9th centuries AD, they could be related to a larger necropolis that was discovered around the basilica (Anon, n.d.). Then, apart from sporadic traces of life even in the Middle Ages, when the arealike the whole town -probably became an open-air stone quarry, the field began a long phase of agricultural use, as evidenced in the historical cartography (Anon, n.d.). Even at the time of the Brusin excavation, as mentioned, the area was a farm and a vineyard. This discontinuity of structures has allowed us to freely investigate the terrain, gathering many clues about its life over time. In summary, it seems that the 5th century AD in Aquileia was a period of profound transformations in the natural and urban landscapes. On the one hand, one could say that the town in this period continued to play an important commercial role in the context of the Northern Adriatic, as demonstrated by the articulated mercantile structure we investigated -which appears to be without equal in the Empire for its dimensions and the structure of its diversified commercial areas -and probably also by a new system of docks along the Natissa, a substitute for the old river port then in disuse (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Besides this urban sector, other important public monuments continued to be vital in this period, such as the so-called 'Great Baths', where archaeologists from the University of Udine found evidence from the 5th century AD of the restoration of floors and the construction of new rooms in the northeast sector (Anon, 2021). Based on the written sources, even the circus and the hypothetical (but not 13. New archaeological perspective on Late Antique Aquileia yet located) imperial residence were still in use at least until the beginning of the 5th century AD, given that the former hosted the execution of John the Usurper in AD 423, and that Galla Placidia and her son Valentinian III, the last emperor who we know to have resided in the town, lodged in the palace until the autumn of AD 425 (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). As in many other urban centers in the Empire, in the 5th century AD Aquilea witnessed the monumentalisation of places of worship, which by these years had become the community's new gathering places, marking a decisive change in the town's topography: one may consider the new religious buildings that extended outside the walls sometime between the 4th and 5th centuries AD, like Saint John in the Forum, the basilica of Saint Felix and Fortunatus and other two basilicas in the southern locality 'Beligna' (named 'del Fondo Tullio') and in the northern locality 'Monastero' (Cuscito, 2004)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.); within the walls there was also the construction, in the time of Chromatius, of the southern post-Theodoran basilica and of the baptistery (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). However, in contrast with this monumental continuity, other archaeological data seem to suggest a completely different urban landscape, with signs of discontinuity and radical and irreversible transformations. Consider the amphitheatre, in the area of today's Palazzo Brunner (via Roma), where the excavations conducted by the University of Verona under my direction between 2015 and 2017 have shown the defunctionalisation of the building by the second half of the 4th century AD and, from the middle of the 5th century AD, the reuse of its radial walls for housing (Anon, n.d.). These were perhaps modular houses, trapezoidal in plan, of perishable materials, which unloaded their domestic garbage in the ancient arena, as proved by the microstratigraphic analysis of organic levels (almost one meter thick) from the arena (Anon, n.d.). If this public building was reappropriated for private purposes and underwent a decisive transformation of its monumental structure, profound alterations of the management of public space, albeit in different, more productive forms, also emerged in the theatre area. In fact, archaeological research suggests that, between the 4th and 5th centuries AD, facilities for the forging and beating of iron, as well as other metals, were created between the theatre buildings (Anon, 2021). Other similar productive structures have also been highlighted by excavations within the urban centre, such as the house of Titus Macro and the warehouses at the port, yet again clearly attesting to ongoing construction in a town that was still very much alive. For the moment, however, with our incomplete data, the image of Aquileia in the 5th century AD remains blurry. We have long since overcome the idea that, after Attila's conquest in AD 452, Aquileia began a long decline that would lead to its definitive disappearance at the dawn of the early Middle Ages (Bratoz, 2003)(Sotinel, 2003)(Villa, 2004)(Marano, 2009)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2022). Nonetheless, this phase of the town's history still requires more multidisciplinary and integrated archaeological research to Notes 1. On the theme of the 5th and 6th centuries in Aquileia with comparisons to other cities, see (Anon, n.d.). 2. The excavations were conducted with ministerial concession and in close scientific collaboration with the Fondazione Aquileia, which also funded our investigations. 3. To date, only initial excavation results have been published (Anon, n.d.)(Basso & Dobreva, 2020)(Basso, 2021)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) and an initial volume on the research conducted in the archives of National Archaeological Museum of Aquileia (Basso & Dobreva forthcoming). 4. The bibliography on Aquileia's marked commercial character is extensive: e.g. Cuscito & Zaccaria 2007; Zaccaria & Pesavento Mattioli 2009; Ungaro et al. 2017, 147-228 together with the preceding bibliography. For an extensive summary of Aquileia market spaces, Tiussi 2004; Basso 2021. 5. Despite its important historical status, few environmental studies have been undertaken at Aquileia. The bibliography on the subject has recently expanded: e.g. Arnaud-Fassetta et al. 2003; Sichè et al. 2004; Cottica et al. 2018; Cottica & Ventura 2019; Kaniewsky et al. 2022. understand the environmental change, not to mention the transformation of politics, society, architecture, and material culture, it witnessed, and which may be fruitfully compared with other urban contexts. Like the phase of urban foundation, for which this volume offers wide-ranging discussions and case studies, Aquileia's history in the 5th century AD represents an extremely complex and therefore also extremely interesting period for the study of urban landscapes -one of radical changes and shifts, the collapse of old realities and the beginnings of other, completely new oneswhich archaeology, with the refinement of its technique and analytical approaches, is ever more capable of grasping. Chapter 14 Bridging the gap: new data on the settlement continuity in Parma from the stone bridge Alessia Morigi To explore the evidence of antiquity in the long-term context of the city of Parma, we could start from Italo Calvino's observation on the ideas underpinning this research: The city however does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls. (Anon, n.d.). In this view, the city mutates and changes over time, and bears, engraved on its surface, the signs of the different landscapes that have characterized it over time. The archaeological features of a centre with a long and continuous history can be traced in the material signs of these changes: stratigraphic studies, renovated remains of ancient buildings, topography, and those signs present that today have become part of the identity of the place and thus act as doors through which to glimpse a submerged history. In the collective imagination, the symbols of Parma are the Romanesque cathedral, the Baptistery, the Teatro Regio and its great artists: Correggio, Parmigianino, Verdi, Toscanini, and Bertolucci. But rather than these eminent aspects, this study focuses on the history of undiscovered Parma using data from new research promoted by Programma S.F.E.R.A. Spazi e Forme dell'Emilia Romagna Antica dell'Università di Parma (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). This study in fact looks at what is called the Roman bridge, the only monument in Parma which makes the invisible visible to us today (Plate 14.1). The research project is in a preliminary phase, and what follows is an initial presentation of some early results and an outline of challenges faced by the research. Parma today is located in a heavily industrialised area and, as in many Italian cities, the urban plan of ancient times has been erased by two thousand years of life and construction. Roman Parma today is confined to the renowned archaeological museum, the Complesso Monumentale della Pilotta, which displays the magnificent art of which the town was the centre. Otherwise, as noted by Andrew Wallace Hadrill (2022) at the 'Symposium Parma 2200' (Anon, 2018), the ancient plan survives in Parma indirectly in the imprint it left on the urban grid (Fig. 14.1A). Such traces are evident in the ancient and modern cities of Emilia Romagna, which share as their centre of gravity the Roman via Aemilia (today 'via Emilia'). The via Aemilia was the decumanus maximus of the entire Roman centuriation still visible in Emilia Romagna (Chevallier, 1961)(Montanari, 1983)(Calzolari, 1995)(Anon, 1996)(Brighi, 1972)(Anon, 2000)(Quilici, 2000)(Anon, 2003)(Maraldi, 2006)(Anon, 2007)(Lenzi, 2009)(Marchesini & Marvelli, 2009)(Anon, n.d.). It is as though the whole region were a gigantic chessboard, coherent in that the main road is also the main axis of its agrarian division. This centuriation is well preserved and is the most important identifying landscape feature in the region of Emilia Romagna. The close interconnection between town and countryside means that a town cannot be studied without its territory, and there have been urban cartography projects carried out using excavations, surveys, and GIS models (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Basso & Dobreva, 2020)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Fontana & Garbasi, 2018)(Morigi & Bergamini, 2019)(Anon, n.d.)(Diosono, 2019)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In this context, the Parma bridge, positioned along the consular road leading out of the town, is to all intents and purposes a link between the town and the territory. This is how it is framed in our description. However, the bridge as a monument has not been able to 'speak'. Until recently there was very little information. Next to nothing was known about its shape, its chronology, its exact location, or its significance in relation to the town and the territory. Until a few years ago, it was also quite difficult to see. It was only in 2018 that a joint project between the University, the Municipality, and Ministry of Culture restored the part of the town where the bridge had been almost hidden underground. Today the area has been reopened for public use as an underpass and is also home to a new Information Centre of the University of Parma (Anon, n.d.)(Morigi, 2016)(Anon, n.d.)(Quintelli, 2015)(Morigi & Tedeschi, 2018). The bridge is thus not only an ancient passage but also a bridge between the city and its university, metaphorically and physically. The project is important; beforehand the surroundings and remains of the bridge were in very poor condition. But since the renovation, the bridge can be clearly viewed in spite of the modern buildings that have sprung up around it. Two new ramps have been put in to cross the bridge from one side to the other and an access ramp, at different heights, allows people to view the bridge from various perspectives. The site of the ancient riverbed has also been restored. And importantly, a permanent open-air museum displaying archaeological discoveries from excavations on the site has already been opened in advance of further study or specific publication. Emergency measures were adopted by the municipality to restore the bridge, and the restoration has radically changed what we know about the history of settlement in Parma. Previously, neither the shape, location nor history of the bridge was known. Focusing first on the shape, the new restoration has made visible only two of the bridge's arches, along the ancient via Aemilia, which runs through the city centre. Geoarchaeological investigations on the site show the location of the palaeo-riverbed. They confirm that the riverbed was very wide in ancient times, as it is in fact today. Stratigraphy of the area also shows that in the earliest times the riverbed included an islet and was therefore very large (Anon, 2012)(Malnati et al., 2013). It is impossible to find and count the remaining arches 'in the field' since today the bridge is enclosed between the present-day riverbed and modern buildings built after the Second World War bombing. We thus carried out an archaeological 'excavation' in the most important historical archives of Parma (Archivio Storico Comunale), where dozens of city maps are conserved. The maps are currently being digitized in GIS in order to reconstruct the evolution of the settlement (Fig. 14.1A). Documents from the archive of the National Archaeological Museum show that in 1858, the Municipal Inspector Martelli discovered the extremity of a bridge along the via Aemilia after the demolition of the building above it. Almost 100 years later, in 1948, an arch was found in the same area and recognised by the Inspector of Antiquities, Corradi Cervi, as part of the ancient bridge (Fig. 14.1B). The distance between the newly discovered arch and the two which are visible today indicates that the bridge was very long. The discovery was very important because it indicates the connection between the bridge and city. But in spite of this coup de théâtre, no further explorations were made until another stroke of luck in 1951. The main road through the town, the modern via Emilia, at the point called today 'via Mazzini', began to subside under the pressure of motor traffic. The owners of the buildings with cellars situated under the road wrote to the Parma Municipality, which commissioned a series of technical surveys. Dozens of documents in the Parma City Archives reveal the cellar owners' alarm and describe the measures taken by the Municipality between the 1950s-60s. These included a number of maps and surveys, which reveal the extent of the bridge. They show the relationship between the ancient arches of the bridge and the small arches of the cellars built inside them clearly. The first series of maps from the 1950s shows seven arches above the cellars of the buildings along the modern 'via Mazzini'. The second series, from the 1960s, shows the same arches, plus two more on the left, which correspond to those now visible in the underpass today (Cervi, 1963)(Catarsi, 1993)). Cross-checking data from the two-map series shows that the bridge had ten arches. Only two can be seen today and eight cannot; seven were buried under 'via Mazzini', and one was destroyed by a bomb in the Second World War (Fig. 14.2A). The second series of surveys is, not surprisingly, more detailed. In fact, at that time new building sites were opening along the via Emilia, and there was consolidation of the areas which had become unstable due to heavy traffic. The building sites inevitably became archaeological sites, and an important sequence of urban archaeological excavations began in Parma. The images, again from the archives, are spectacular. Under the via Emilia, the buried arches, which had been repeatedly reported since the end of the 19th century, came to light. They remained, however, embedded in the foundations of the buildings, and were only partially visible (Fig. 14.3A). Only the arches nearest to the river could be seen in all their splendour under the modern road (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). At this point in the story of the bridge, the human factor entered the sequence of events. The excavations provoked heated debate between those who wanted to create an open-air museum encompassing the whole bridge, and those for whom the requirements of modern life were the priority. The issue was significant in that the construction site and the excavations interrupted the city's main traffic route. The impact of the old town on the modern city was considered a threat. There was a clash involving the Municipality and the Ministry of Culture, as it is called today, and neither side was prepared to give way (Morigi, 2016)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In the end, the cause of the rebirth of the bridge was also the cause of its premature death. The road became dangerously unstable and the Municipality hastily covered all the arches of the bridge with the asphalt of the modern via Emilia. Only the two arches next to the river, which lay under the road but not under buildings, were saved. In 1967 they were enclosed inside the underpass of the modern via Emilia, from which they were only freed in 2018. So, in shape the bridge comprised ten, or rather, at least ten, arches. To give a definitive shape to the bridge, we need to explore precisely where it stands. The bridge was narrow and ran between the colony and the suburban road hub (Anon, 2000)(Quilici, 2000)(Dall'aglio & Cocco, 2006)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Morigi, 2015)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Fontana & Garbasi, 2018)(Fontana, 2020)). On the town side, the bridge was bordered by the perimeter of the Roman colony of 183 BC. The urban grid of the colony on the river side is missing a corner and changes shape in line with the course of the palaeo-river (Dall (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Catarsi, 2009)(Morigi, 2009)(Morigi, 2015). The bridge borders the junction of the Roman roads leading both to the plain and to the mountains. Towards the plain the roads led to the River Po, the most important Italian waterway, with its important inland ports. Towards the mountains a road led to the most famous Roman town in the area, Lunae. The starting point of these Roman roads is easily recognised because the roads themselves are preserved beneath the modern ones and because they are archaeologically documented (Anon, 1990)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2006)(Morigi, 2009)(Anon, n.d.). The position of the junction confirms that the bridge was longer than the surviving one: the arches do not, in fact, fully span the palaeo-river. That the bridge was longer than today is also confirmed by the arches themselves: they in fact rise in the direction of the river so must have descended equally on the opposite side. The bridge is humpbacked with a gradual raising of the road surface from east to west. However, the question is complex, because the length of the bridge must have depended on the position of the palaeo-river, which moved over the years (Balista, 1997)(Cremaschi, 1997)(Anon, 2012)(Anon, n.d.). New data on this are provided by the stratigraphic excavation made next to the bridge in what is today 'Piazza Ghiaia' (Malnati et al., 2013)(Anon, n.d.). 'Piazza Ghiaia', the name of which derives from glarea, corresponds in position to the ancient riverbed over which the bridge once stood. The excavation revealed banks of alluvial gravel, confirming the presence of an active riverbed. We know that the riverbed dried up during the disastrous flood of AD 1180 described in medieval chronicles. However, the excavation revealed the history of the riverbed in Roman times, confirming that it had changed course several times (Fig. 14.4B). Defensive structures have in fact been found on its banks, and these structures altered over time according to the changes in the riverbed (Malnati et al., 2013). There are three examples of the defence of the riverbanks. The oldest consists of a series of wooden posts and can be dated to the Republican period thanks to the finding of a coin dated to around 211 BC. The second, a wooden palisade from the Imperial period, has large blocks of travertine and spolia (Catarsi, 2009)) reinforcing the posts, and was possibly put in place in response to a sudden shift in the course of the river. The third defence involved wooden structures, perhaps pertaining to a basin or dock (Malnati et al., 2013). The stratigraphic data, along with these three defences, show that the riverbed shifted over the years in different parts of the site. Geological data confirm this and, given that the river is a 'torrente' whose level fluctuates hugely, it is not surprising. The mapping of findings, on the other hand, is surprising, as it shows that the riverbed is not where it was expected to be, but further away from the town. This revised location for the riverbed is also confirmed by geoarchaeological analysis, which also shows that the alluvial deposits brought by flooding tend to be associated with postantique landscaping and construction (Catarsi, 2009)(Marchi & Serchia, 2022). Geoarchaeological analysis changes our perspective: it is now certain that in the 2nd century AD, the river ran further away from the colony than had been thought, and the bridge would have needed more arches to cross it. Once the results of the geoarchaeological study are published, the picture will be clearer. What appears certain today, however, is that the bridge consisted of a series of arches supported by piers carrying a road over the river. This type of bridge, or viaduct, is well suited to the type of river, subject to heavy flooding and having a very wide and unstable bed, as it still does today. The grandeur of the bridge corresponded to its importance along the via Aemilia. It in fact served as link between two worlds: on one side the Roman colony and on the other the area outside town with roads leading into the province, burial grounds, and well-documented artisan centres (Anon, n.d.)(Catarsi, 2009)(Santoro, 2009). There was a network of medium-distance centurial roads and long-distance trans-Apennine roads, and about ten miles from Parma runs the powerful waterway of the River Po. Parma thus lay at the centre of a strong system of roads and waterways. Their importance and durability are shown by the most famous of these, the Roman road between Parma, in Emilia, and Luni (Lunae), in Lunigiana, which, since the Middle Ages has been known by its medieval name, the 'Via Francigena' (Anon, 1998)(Anon, n.d.)(Medas, 2017). As regards the chronology of the bridge, a question mark hangs over the date it was built. Traditionally it was thought to have been built in Roman times and restored in Late Antiquity by King Theodoric (AD 493-526) (Anon, n.d.)(Catarsi, 1993). It was thought that the appearance of the bridge in modern times was similar to that at the time of Theodoric, who also built the walls in Parma. Let us examine this question. Theodoric, the Gothic king, was particularly important in the region of Emilia Romagna because of the presence of Ravenna. In Ravenna and across the region, particularly the Romagna part, his name is attached to palaces, monumental tombs, elegant domus, and his great villa at Galeata (Forlì-Cesena), currently under excavation by archaeologists from the University of Parma (Anon, 2017)(Diosono et al., 2019)(Diosono, 2019)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Parma enjoyed a certain prosperity under the reign of Theodoric and the presence of the Goths is documented archaeologically in the city and in the local area (Fava, 2006)(Catarsi, 2009)(Anon, n.d.). There is, however, only one extant text which mentions Theodoric: Cassiodorus (Var. 8.29.1) reports on a letter from Atalaric, which says that Theodoric, in the manner of the Roman emperors, had brought large quantities of water to the town by restoring a watercourse towards Parma (civitatem… saluberrima unda rigavit). Archaeologically, however, no 6th-century AD aqueduct has been traced, and we therefore surmise that Theodoric intervened by restructuring the ancient aqueduct and the urban canals. In fact, as Cassiodorus notes, Atalaric recalls that Parma curiales quia civis animum non habet, qui urbis suae gratia non tenetur. In Late Antiquity, the town grew on the foundations of its ancient palimpsest, conserving its ancient monuments and its civic identity. As observed by Wallace-Hadrill, the cities of Cassiodorus show 'the resilience of urban values' (Wallace-Hadrill 2022, 28). The resilience of Parma is fully confirmed by archaeological studies. Sewers and aqueducts had been defunct since the 4th century AD and Roman masonry pipelines were cut off from the town during the wars that led to the fall of the Western Roman Empire (Anon, n.d.). Canals, however, existed during Roman times. The Canale Maggiore ran along the walls, on the high ground on which the Roman colony was founded (Dall (Anon, n.d.). Recent research findings under the S.F.E.R.A. programme reveal that the Canale Comune ran along the ancient riverbed 14. Bridging the gap during the Bronze Age, and that the river itself reached the forum. At the time of the foundation of the colony, the cardo maximus ran along the canal for its entire length. The Canale Comune is therefore very important as the axis of the grid of the Roman colony and because it was used in medieval as well as modern times (Lucchetti, 1965)). Theodoric's intention to restore the town's internal water network was sound, as it was this network which generated the landscape of open canals and the Farnese aqueduct in post-antique Parma. This data offers several insights in terms of the archaeology of waters systems. If the Goths intervened in the water infrastructure, it is in fact strange that Cassiodorus did not mention the bridge when describing water routes. We now focus on the second part of the traditional belief and ask whether Theodoric actually intervened on the walls. Over the last 200 years, archaeology has uncovered various sections of wall, but the documentation is patchy, both spatially and methodologically. Recent stratigraphic excavations show that the sections of wall made of concrete with stone facing date from the end of the 3rd century AD. The late walls are thought to have been built over previous Republican brick walls, which were preserved until the Imperial period. The epigraph of Quintus Munatius Apsirtos mentions a town gate in the 1st century AD (Arrigoni Bertini 2008). However, there is no reference to Theodoric regarding the walls, just as there is no reference to him regarding the bridge (Anon, n.d.)(Fava, 2006)(Marchi & Serchia, 2022)). To answer our questions, we therefore return to the bridge. After the renovation, it was possible to conduct a new survey and technical analysis of the two accessible arches. The arches are between 9 and 11 m wide, all rounded (except for the eighth arch which has been reworked), and made of stone blocks (about 50 × 90 cm) and smaller stones mixed with cobblestones. With regard to the piers, the documentation covers only the two easternmost ones, now buried, and the westernmost one, still visible. They were built with a concrete core lined with large pebbles and square stone blocks. All three have a breakwater rostrum facing upstream. At the eastern end of the bridge, an 8-m-long breakwater protected the town from flooding. The width of the road starts at 4.6 m and then narrows to 3.8 m. Regarding the building technique, both buried and visible structures show apparent differences, but the documentation offered by earlier photographs is often unclear. The structures which are visible appear to be slightly misaligned and more reworked, and the buried structures appear to be straighter and more regular. Comparison of the less reworked part of both suggests, however, that the differences are not significant. And the direction of the bridge is certain as it can only lead towards the via Aemilia on the other side of the river. It can be helpful to compare the characteristics of the Parma bridge with others in the area. Today only two bridges in the Parma area retain their arches: Parma and Fidenza. The Roman bridge at Fidenza runs along the via Emilia, like the bridge in Parma, and is dated to the 1st-2nd centuries AD. Discovered in 1847, it was surveyed by Astolfi and Pigorini and is still partly visible today. It would be therefore useful for comparison, but it uses the traditional Roman technique of square blocks and bears no resemblance to Parma bridge (Anon, n.d.). The only other Roman bridge known of nearby is at Bettola near Piacenza. This bridge, built of roughly shaped stones, was located near a Roman kiln and dated between the second and third century BC. It is not, however, visible today and there is no certainty about its origins (Anon, n.d.). In the western part of Emilia, the bridges of Pontenure, Castellarquato, and Pieve di Campi were all built using regular building techniques with square blocks and have a double rostrum upstream and downstream (Anon, n.d.). They have little or nothing in common with the Parma bridge. Broadening the perspective to the whole Emilia Romagna region, the beginning of the via Aemilia in Rimini is marked by the famous 'Ponte di Tiberio'. This is a more usual isodomic bridge and very different from the one in Parma (Anon, 2016)). Looking at the widths of the road on the Parma bridge, as noted above, these range from 4.6 m to 3.8 m and are consistent with the sections of Roman roads found in Parma. These were usually 4 m wide; only the cardo and decumanus were paved, while the minor roads were gravel. Since, however, urban roads often keep the same dimensions over time, this is not diagnostic. So the question arises: is this really a Roman bridge? And if not, where is the Roman bridge on the via Aemilia that connected the Roman colony with the outside world? The question can be answered using stratigraphy and laboratory analysis. The stratigraphic excavation in Piazza Ghiaia (Malnati et al., 2013) brought to light a bridge pier from the Roman period made of concrete and with a brick face (Fig. 14.4C). It dated from the early Imperial period and had collapsed after a serious flood at the end of the 2nd century AD (Anon, n.d.). The stratigraphy shows that this was a bridge predating the one which we see today. It was built by Augustus, who also built the new Capitolium, theatre, and amphitheatre in Parma (Catarsi, 2009)). An epigraph from the 1st century AD recalls the work of Quinto Munazio Apsirto, who, at his own expense, had a stretch of the via Aemilia, that is the road running over the bridge, paved (stravit) (Bertini & G, 2008). This must therefore be the Roman bridge which, until the 2nd century AD, was part of the via Aemilia. If this is in fact the case, there was more than one bridge in Parma: there would have been two bridges side by side. The excavation in Piazza Ghiaia provided further information about the urban landscape within which the Roman bridge stood. The finding of a sacellum and a votive shrine show that there was also a ford. The shrine had coins and metal objects from between the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, in all probability forfeited to the river deity for a safe crossing. A second votive shrine was used in the early Imperial period (Anon, 2013). Therefore, the ford existed before the Roman colony, perhaps making use of an islet. It is proof that there was a settlement of some type in Parma before the Romans came to build a colony there (Anon, 2013). The ford existed for a very long time, as did the main trade routes. The excavation in fact revealed traces 14. Bridging the gap of the wool trade, consisting of inscribed lead seals for semi-processed hanks of wool dated between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD (Cavalieri, 2003). Along the many canals that crisscrossed the town, wool processing and dyeing were carried out for centuries until the Middle Ages. Piazza Ghiaia itself was always a centre of trade and commerce in the area around the bridge: in medieval times there were many shops, and from Farnese times onwards it became a marketplace (Anon, 2002). But the Roman bridge was destroyed by flooding in the 2nd century AD. The two bridges, the brick and the stone bridge, were close to each other, and were probably not used at the same time, given the state of collapse of the brick bridge, which was buried in a sandbank. So we are left with the question of whether the bridge we see today is the one which replaced the Imperial bridge. There is no information about it until about AD 1180, when the three rivers around Parma were severely flooded. The floods are recounted in the Chronicon Parmense (Bonazzi, 1902), kept in the Biblioteca Palatina in Parma. Even today Emilia is vulnerable to flooding, and Parma was severely flooded as recently as 2014. But in AD 1180 the floods diverted the course of the river and badly damaged the bridge, without completely destroying it. A medieval merchant guild seal (Fig. 14.1C) shows its arches supporting shops and dwellings, as it was the case with other more famous bridges, such as 'Ponte Vecchio' in Florence. The bridge functioned as a marketplace until AD 1547, when the first Duke of Parma, Pier Luigi Farnese, had the shops demolished and the bridge restored. In AD 1287 the via Aemilia had been diverted further upstream to the temporary pons Solariorum, but after almost 400 years it was brought back to life under the Farnese (Anon, 2002). So, the bridge in question was built after the 2nd century AD and was not actually used to cross the river after the 12th century AD floods. Laboratory analyses provide some indications on what happened within that period. The analysis of a sample of mortar from the exposed part of the bridge suggests that it dates to between AD 332-433 (Lindroos et al., 2018). The sample comes from a reconstructed part of the bridge and the date implies that this bridge replaced the one that collapsed in AD 160 and that was restored in the 4th-5th centuries AD. As it happens, in the 4th century AD there was not only a flood but also an earthquake in Parma (Dall'aglio, 2000)(Anon, 2000)(Anon, n.d.). Stratigraphic confirmation of this come from the 'Domus degli Augustales', the 'Domus degli Stucchi' and the walls themselves. The domus were abandoned, but the walls, on a brick foundation, underwent restorations that can be dated on a stratigraphic basis to the 3rd-4th centuries AD. This is similar to what appears to have happened to the bridge. This would mean that there was a Roman bridge which collapsed in the 2nd century AD, another one which collapsed in the 4th century AD, and a third one, which is the one which can be seen in the underpass today, which was taken out of use in the 12th century AD. The hasty rebuilding of the bridge after the earthquake would explain the uneven technique that characterises it. Looking at the shape of the bridge in light of this new information, the recent renovation makes it possible to examine variations in the fabric of the wall (Fig. (Anon, n.d.). The bridge of the end of the 2nd to 3rd centuries may in fact survive in the bases of the piers. Although they were completely rebuilt, they make systematic use of isodomic blocks and support 9-10-m-wide arches like those of the 'Ponte di Tiberio' in Rimini, which measure 8-10 m, in keeping with the measurements usually used in Roman construction. This suggests that the project of the bridge may well date to this period. On the other hand, the portion of the bridge dated on the base of the mortar samples appears to date from around the 4th century AD or shortly afterwards. The most recent masonry work clearly corresponds to the medieval phase documented by the merchant guild seal. The remaining masonry corresponds to restoration of the bald arches for the construction of buildings above, which are often added when a bridge loses its function. Certain aspects of the history of the bridge are clear and others less so. Not only the two mortar samples came from the same arch, but, since results were not technically obtainable for deep samples from Parma, they were taken from the surface: therefore, they may not be completely reliable and they cannot exclude the possibility that the bridge may be later than Roman. Under the Lombards, Parma underwent a great deal of reconstruction, and between the 6th-7th centuries AD the great Roman amphitheatre became the residence of the Lombard dukes (Gelichi, 2011)). In the 12th century AD, before the flood, Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa established a palace in the area, referred to in archival sources as palacium de arena (Guzzon, 1995). At this time the bridge was in use and will certainly have undergone alterations to keep the town's main road in use. If we look at the bridge without preconceptions, it clearly resembles bridges of the early Middle Ages. This broader perspective in fact simplifies the interpretation of the construction, the contextualisation of the chrono-typological characteristics and the dating of the walls and architectural characteristics. Until recently, these characteristics did not lead to a precise interpretation of the bridge and did not help to identify its history correctly. The bridge is in fact anomalous compared to other bridges identified as Roman, and also compared to bridges from the 13th-14th centuries AD built in the Age of Communes. A good example in a neighbouring area is the medieval bridge over the River Secchia near Rubiera, which used completely different building techniques. The structure in Rubiera includes a hexagonal pier equipped with two breakwaters in the manner of 1st-3rd centuries AD bridges. It also includes closely fitting pseudo-isodomic blocks and large square blocks at the top. The similarity with Roman bridges probably reflects that the skills typical of that period had reappeared in Medieval construction. The Rubiera bridge was for a long time thought to be Roman, but mensiochronological analysis from the rows of bricks interspersed with the stone blocks revealed that it is in fact medieval (Degani, 1970). This clearly shows that it is impossible to date works of this type in western Emilia on a purely technical-stylistic basis. Featuring medieval as well as ancient architectural elements, the bridge in Parma follows archetypal Roman measurements, and this is also true of the submerged isodomic piers. Analysis of the mortar from the arch shows that it could have been used between the 4th and 5th centuries AD (Lindroos et al., 2018) and was therefore presumably used from that point onwards. The arches appear to have been built by inexpert workers, and the building materials appear to have been chosen and used in haste. The lintels of the arches make use of rough-hewn materials and small pebbles, whereas fragments and scraps were used as padding to stabilise a vault rendered somewhat fragile by its size (which is what suggests a later date). They were probably also damaged by a 6th-century AD flood upstream of the bridge near the town walls in 'Via del Conservatorio' (Marchi & Serchia, 2022). Looking further into the area, comparison can be made with the technique of the arches of the bridge at Vetto (13th century AD). Other bridges in the Upper Valley of the Parma River ('Alta Val Parma'), such as that over the River Prolo, used the same technique around the 14th century AD. In short, the Parma bridge was built over a lengthy period. And in this it is like one of the most famous bridges in western Emilia, the bridge of San Colombano Abbey in Bobbio (the one perhaps depicted by Leonardo da Vinci in the Mona Lisa portrait): this is a 7th-century AD bridge, coeval to the Abbey, built on a Roman structure, and it was, as we know, rebuilt countless times. Chapter 15 Conclusion: recent discoveries and new directions John R. Patterson The history of Italy under the Romans is to a significant extent the history of its cities. Not only did these act as a stage where the ruling elites could display their wealth and influence, but they also served to control the resources produced by the cities' own territories, and collectively formed a structure which enabled the whole peninsula to be administered and controlled under the oversight of Rome. This volume provides a rich and welcome overview of recent and current research on a selection of these cities, and many of the papers also serve as appetisers for important (and imminent) new publications of work carried out over many years. These include reports on major projects at Falerii Novi (Anon, n.d.), and Interamna Lirenas (Anon, n.d.), and on excavations at Fregellae of a series of domus, notable for their early date and their degree of preservation, until their destruction by a Roman army in 125 BC (Anon, n.d.). Along with the more specifically archaeological acquisitions, the body of fieldwork outlined here has also identified new elements in the epigraphic record. In particular a calendar and consular Fasti painted on wall-plaster, the surviving portion covering the period from the 40s BC to the 30s AD, have been discovered during the excavation of a portico close to the forum at Alba Fucens. It is already clear that this document will cast new light on the political history and the prosopography of the triumviral period, and of the early Principate (Letta, 2012)(Anon, n.d.). Collectively, then, the work being presented here is of great significance for the history of Roman Italy. As Millett highlights in his contribution, and is also made abundantly clear by the other essays in the volume, 'cities' do not constitute a unified category in Italy in this period. While they do share essentially similar institutional frameworks, their formal status may be that of colonies (of various kinds) or municipalities. Urban frameworks may already be more or less familiar in the surrounding area; cities' physical extent, as defined by the surface area of the territory within their walls, may be large or small, as may the density of occupation, and so the population occupying that area. They may have extensive and agriculturally rich territories, and access to external resources by means of political control, trade and commerce, and connectivity with the world beyond the city's boundary. Alternatively, they may occupy a small territory, hemmed in by neighbouring cities, controlling only marginal and unproductive lands, and far away from the networks to which roads, major rivers and the sea give access. Cities may of course combine these various features to a greater or lesser extent. The central challenge for the scholar in analysing patterns of urbanism in Roman Italy is how to balance general trends with local combinations of circumstances, across the centuries which we define as 'Roman history'. The essays in the volume raise a wide variety of important issues, methodological and historical, only a few of which can be highlighted here. One central theme is the way in which multiple remote sensing technologies are now being used, often in combination, and alongside more traditional approaches to landscape history, to explore the cities of Italy. Ground-penetrating radar and resistivity have been deployed alongside magnetometry (itself extensively used since the 1990s), allowing a greater sense of depth to emerge from the imaging of a site, although the outcome is still inevitably in the form of a palimpsest (Anon, n.d.). This geophysical analysis can in turn be followed by more targeted excavation, as at Aeclanum (Anon, n.d.) and/or combined with surface survey within the urban centre, as for example at Interamna (Anon, n.d.). Various forms of aerial photography and photogrammetry, using drones as well as conventional aircraft, are being deployed alongside geophysical techniques to reconstruct the urban layout, as at Aquinum and Septempeda (Anon, n.d.). While remote sensing techniques have produced their most spectacular results on 'greenfield' sites (where there is very little post-Roman settlement), the work carried out on the Caelian Hill at Rome demonstrates how they can also be deployed with success in densely occupied and deeply stratified urban contexts, alongside structural archaeology, and the use of boreholes (Anon, n.d.). As a result, a dossier of information is being built up for the towns of Italy, combining both the high-resolution data provided by stratigraphic excavation, and the lower-resolution knowledge of cityscapes enabled by the extensive deployment of remote sensing techniques, and by surface survey, which can in turn be set alongside epigraphic and literary evidence. It is also worth highlighting in particular the potential importance for the understanding of urban -and indeed rural -landscapes of the detailed study of commonware pottery, as the strikingly different reconstructions of settlement dynamics at Interamna between the late Republic and the 3rd century AD demonstrate. The field survey carried out there in the 2010s, characterised by particular attention to commonwares, suggests a general continuity of habitation on the site into the high Empire, by contrast to the striking pattern of decline suggested by the survey of Hayes and Wightman in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which predominantly focused on fineware pottery (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Much recent research on the Roman city has been concerned with the phenomenon of colonisation in the mid-Republic, and this is also true of many of the papers here. Fregellae, Interamna, Alba Fucens, Cosa, and Aquileia, all founded as Latin colonies, are represented (Anon, n.d.): the precise knowledge derived from literary texts about when, and in what circumstances, these settlements were founded, and sometimes reinforced, provides a fundamental -if sometimes elusivestarting point for understanding their urban frameworks. The circumstances of the destruction of Fregellae, following that colony's rebellion against Rome in 125 BC, and the absence of significant later settlement on the site, makes the city a 'closed context' of particular interest. Recent work on Latin colonies has tended to move away from Aulus Gellius' idea of these being standardised 'little images and copies' of (Anon, n.d.), with e.g. the essays in (Anon, n.d.); instead, scholars have stressed the different circumstances of their foundation, and the diversity of the sites themselves and of their populations of settlers, which may in some cases have included indigenous inhabitants. The papers presented here further contribute to this picture of complexity. De Giorgi for example relates the reinforcement of Cosa at the beginning of the 2nd century BC to the decline of the fortified settlement at Orbetello on the coast below. On the other hand, the module used for laying out rooms adjacent to the forum at Alba Fucens is the same as that used at Paestum, another Latin colony established some 25 years later (Anon, n.d.), suggesting a certain standardisation in this respect at least. Lunae (founded 177 BC) was a Roman citizen colony, and here the archaeology has cast light on the earliest phases of the settlement, with a stockade containing huts built in clay and straw, and perhaps constituting the original habitation of the colonists. The burial of dogs in locations close to the city walls, as also attested at Ariminum and Paestum, seems to be related to foundational rites (Anon, n.d.). Colonial foundations thus continue to emerge as a striking combination of innovation and traditionalism. Unsurprisingly, both broad historical trends and more specific circumstances can be seen to be contributing to the history of urban centres. The process of municipalisation after the grants of Roman citizenship to Italians in the years following the Social War is clearly fundamental, for example (Anon, n.d.), but individual episodes are important too. The reconstruction of Aeclanum following that town's sack in 89 BC is led by Sulla's associates, including C. Quinctus Valgus, who are attested building walls and other fortifications (Anon, n.d.). Similarly, it has been suggested that the impressive walls and towers at Septempeda should be related to the settlement at the site of Social War veterans who had served under Sulla (Anon, n.d.). A generation later, local elites again had to manoeuvre carefully, and make decisions of crucial importance for the fate of their community, as more conflict broke out, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and then between Caesar's heir Octavian and Mark Antony. Both Alba Fucens and Interamna -wisely, as it turned out -chose Caesar as patron of their community, and Alba Fucens subsequently chose to support his adoptive son in a stand-off with Antony at the town late in 44 BC (Anon, n.d.). Following the establishment of the Principate, the support of the emperor, or someone close to him, might similarly have affected the urban fabric. At Alba Fucens, the amphitheatre was constructed with funds bequeathed to what was probably his home town by Q. Naevius Cordus Sutorius Macro, Praetorian Prefect of the emperor Tiberius in succession to Sejanus; Macro we also know to have owned brickworks nearby (Anon, n.d.). The 2nd century AD enhancement of the cityscape of Aeclanum may in part be linked to the grant of colonial status to the town by the emperor Hadrian (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). This wealth of recent work has also allowed the identification of a number of previously unknown public monuments in Italian cities: the location of the forum itself has been identified at Aeclanum (Anon, n.d.), theatres have been located at Interamna and Aeclanum (Anon, n.d.), macella at Falerii and Interamna (Anon, n.d.), and important bath-buildings at Fregellae and Aquinum. The Fregellae baths are of particular interest because of their early date (in three phrases between the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC) and the ways in which they can be compared with Greek models (Anon, n.d.); revised chronology suggested by Diosono); the Aquinum baths are remarkable for their scale, and because they preserve a mosaic inscription recording the name of the man who constructed them in the Augustan period, M. Veccius (Ceraudo et al., 2017)(Anon, n.d.). Monuments of these types are arguably the product not only of elite munificence and inter-city competitive emulation within Italy, but also influenced by examples of monumental building at Rome: the Theatre of Marcellus and the Macellum Magnum of Nero, to cite only a couple of examples. More specific influences can be seen in the Corinthian capitals recalling those of the Forum of Augustus found in the 'Columnar Hall' excavated at Alba Fucens (Anon, n.d.) and the so-called 'Forum Adiectum' of Claudian date, adjacent to the main forum at Lunae (Anon, n.d.) this example should be added to the list of multiple fora in Italian towns discussed in Patterson 2022) which seems to have been influenced by the Fora of Caesar and Augustus adjacent to the Forum Romanum. Similarly, the Sessorian palace complex, a 'new city' on the eastern Caelian at Rome, containing as it does the Amphitheatrum Castrense and Varian Circus, which were subsequently incorporated into the Aurelianic Wall, can be compared with the later Tetrarchic palatial residences established in key locations around the Empire (Anon, n.d.). This sector of Rome became more militarised in the late 2nd century AD, with the establishment of a new camp for the imperial horse-guards, and the provision of military supplies thus became particularly important, just as it did at Aquileia, where soldiers were often stationed, as the city served as a supply base for the Danubian frontier to the North (Anon, n.d.). The distinctive appearance of monuments such as theatres and macella makes them particularly easy to spot in the geophysical record. Equally, the ability to see the layout of an entire city also allows us to pay appropriate attention to structures and spaces which are less standardised but nevertheless played an important role in the urban landscape. These include the courtyard buildings identified as horrea, the finely decorated halls plausibly to be associated with sub-elite bodies like collegia and the Augustales, as at Alba, Lunae, and Interamna (Anon, n.d.), and defined open areas, such as the campus outside the city walls at Septempeda (Anon, n.d.), or the space interpreted as the forum pecuarium, an animal market, at Interamna (Anon, n.d.). Similarly, a recurrent theme in the studies contained in this volume is an interest in those areas on the margins of the cities -both inside and outside the city wallswhich have tended to be neglected in past fieldwork, mostly concerned with the monumental public buildings in the vicinity of a city's forum. At Falerii Novi and at Septempeda, geophysical survey was carried out in the area outside the walls, illustrating the way in which the approach to a city might be characterised both by the commemoration of the dead, and by activities excluded from the city by virtue of their hazardous or offensive character, such as quarrying or pottery production (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Hay et al., 2010). The bridge at Parma over the river of the same name served as a kind of monumental entrance to the city, from a location primarily characterised by tombs, workshops, and road-junctions, but separated from the urban centre proper by the river channel (Anon, n.d.), while the lofty position of the horseguards' barracks at Rome served to intimidate anyone approaching the Severan city from the southeast (Anon, n.d.), just as the Praetorian Camp had previously done for travellers approaching from the northeast. Once inside the city of Falerii, the series of temples located inside the wall-circuit highlighted to the visitor the particular importance of the sacred in the urban topography of that city (Anon, n.d.). The practicalities of community life were likewise a major focus of the peripheral areas of the city. The forum pecuarium at Interamna was located at the southeast end of the city, presumably in order to avoid flocks of animals having to be herded through the streets. Likewise storage and marketing facilities were often located on the periphery. This was the case in Rome under the Principate, where the Macellum of Republican date adjacent to the Forum Romanum was supplemented (under Augustus) by the Macellum of Livia on the Esquiline, and later replaced by the Macellum of Nero on the Caelian, both of which locations were more easily accessible from the city's southeastern hinterland (Anon, n.d.). At Cosa and Aquileia, markets and storage buildings were located at the edge of the city, whether concerned with commercial activities or for the supply of the community itself; horrea might however also be found in more central locations (Anon, n.d.) for an important recent discussion of the phenomenon of storage, see van Oyen 2020). Similarly, the periphery of towns was often also characterised by infrastructure relating to water supply, especially where one part of the city was at a physically higher level, for example the Caelian hill at Rome, where there was a concentration of the aqueducts which supplied much of the city (Anon, n.d.). Provision of water was a particular issue at Cosa, where there was no perennial water source on the hilltop, and both cisterns and what appears to be a mechanism for transporting water up the hill from a spring in the vicinity of the harbour have been identified (Anon, n.d.). The advent of Christianity, too, can be seen to have had a particular impact on the periphery of the cities: at Rome, the Lateran basilica was constructed on the site of the former barracks (Anon, n.d.), well away from the traditional religious and political spaces of the city; likewise the first, Constantinian, basilica at Aquileia was located close to the Late Antique market and walls, shifting 'the urban centre of gravity from the forum, the heart of Aquileia in the Republican and Imperial periods, to this southwestern part of the town' (Anon, n.d.). It is worth stressing that peripheral areas of the city were not only indeterminate and marginal in character, but also were liable to change over time. In particular, as new defences were created in response to security threats, areas which had previously been outside the city subsequently came to be included within it. This can be seen in particular at Rome: in the late Republic and early Principate the city grew beyond the so-called Servian Walls, and so the Lateran and Caelian hills came to be characterised not only by tombs but by the horti of the wealthy; subsequently these were included in the late 3rd-century AD Aurelianic wall. At Aquileia, too, we can see the wall-circuit being extended more than once, the Republican walls being replaced by a new circuit in the late 3rd/early 4th centuries AD, and in turn by another in the 5th century AD, in response to a change in the course of the river (Anon, n.d.). As suggested at the outset, the history of a Roman city, and in particular the extent of its civic superstructure, was closely linked to the resources available to that city, whether from its own territory or beyond. Crucial here were the ways in which roads, rivers, and the sea provided connectivity beyond the city's boundaries. Under the Republic, Latin colonies were often established in close relation to roadbuilding schemes, although the foundation of the colony might either precede or follow the laying out of the road in chronological terms (Anon, n.d.). While Fregellae and Interamna were both located on the via Latina, the exact relationship between the foundation of the colonies and the laying out of the road as a longdistance route is unclear; the establishment of Alba Fucens was subsequent to the construction of the via Valeria, which extended the route of the via Tiburtina eastwards into the territory of the Marsi. Septempeda seems to have developed along the road which connected the via Flaminia with the Adriatic at Ancona (Anon, n.d.), while the relationship of the early phases of settlement at Aeclanum with the laying out of the via Appia remains obscure (Anon, n.d.). Main roads typically, but not always, ran through the centres of towns: the latter served as sources of provisions for travellers, but the roads also provided a means of social networking with Rome, the Roman elite in particular, and other communities in Italy (Anon, n.d.). Being bypassed by a major road, however, need not necessarily have been disastrous for a community: the survey results suggest that Interamna continued to prosper even though, from the late Republic onwards, long-distance travellers journeying South along the via Latina headed direct from Aquinum to Casinum; likewise the institution of the more direct via Traiana route between Beneventum and Brundisium seems not to have been detrimental to the fortunes of Aeclanum (Anon, n.d.), where Hadrian intervened to enhance the road-network in the area, presumably in relation to his grant of colonial status to the community (Anon, n.d.)(Ceraudo, 2022). While urban centres were often laid out giving emphasis to the main road -the via Amerina at Falerii being a case in point (Anon, n.d.) -this was not invariably the case: the public monuments of Aeclanum and Interamna seem to have been directed to the viewer in the territory as well, creating impressive vistas from afar (Anon, n.d.). Access to ports was similarly of major importance in terms of connectivity, in cases where a town had access to the sea or to a navigable river. At Interamna, a group of buildings outside the city walls, but close to the River Liri, has been identified as the river-port of the town (Anon, n.d.). At Lunae, investigations in the southeast quarter of the city, along the road that gave access to the port, have revealed a complex of wealthy houses: one of these, dating to the late Republic, was decorated with a mosaic depicting ships, perhaps reflecting the source of the owner's wealth. In both cities, the existence of the port facilities seems to have been important in determining the wealth available to the town, whether related to the export of marble (as at Lunae) or of agricultural produce (as at Interamna) (Anon, n.d.). In general, much of a city's wealth was likely to be locally generated, the prosperity of Aeclanum largely relating to its extensive and fertile territory (Anon, n.d.). The case of Alba Fucens is a particularly interesting one in this context, given that we can explicitly see the extent of the agricultural land available to the community increasing in size, as the draining of the Fucine Lake seems finally to have taken place in the mid-2nd century AD, after various false starts. This does indeed seem to have been reflected in the changes in the urban superstructure of the town (Anon, n.d.). Needless to say, the papers contained in the volume also flag up topics and debates which seem to me to be worthy of further investigation. To take just three: 1. Survey at Lucus Feroniae has confirmed that the town centre there is one essentially characterised by public monuments, without significant areas of urban habitation, although a number of villas have been identified in the vicinity, notably that of the Volusii Saturnini (Anon, n.d.). The particular history of this site, and especially the presence of the sanctuary of Feronia, seems of special relevance, given also that the geophysics has identified what seems to be a sacred grove here. Equally, geophysical survey at Forum Novum, in Sabine territory on the opposite side of the Tiber, showed that this site too had little in the way of a population resident in its urban centre (Gaffney et al., 2001), and Kay et al. note that recent surveys at other small urban sites in the central Appennines, such as Amiternum, Iuvanum, and Peltuinum, have suggested similar patterns. Septempeda, however, does appear to have had a significant urban population (Vermeulen, who cautiously refers to 'the demographic bloom of the settlement from the 1st century BC onwards, when living quarters perhaps gradually filled the intra-mural space once the town wall was built'). Why do some small towns have substantial populations resident in the urban centre, and others not? How far did this process affect urban space more broadly, though? (Anon, n.d.) suggests that urban centres may have been less affected by the process of colonization than the cities' territories, though he also notes Dio's reference to widespread street-fighting taking place between veterans and the dispossessed, within Italian towns as well as at ; wealthy individuals may have had urban as well as rural properties. Many of the cities targeted by the triumvirs Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus for the confiscation and redistribution of land remained substantial urban centres into the mediaeval period and beyond, so there are few opportunities to undertake the kind of greenfield remote-sensing survey that has been carried out with such success at a number of Latin colonies. Aquinum, if -as seems likely -it is correctly identified as a triumviral colony (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), may potentially be an important case study here: the city stands out from the others discussed in this volume in terms of its surface area, the land enclosed within the walls being some 100 ha (by contrast with Cosa [13 ha]; Septempeda [15 ha]; Aeclanum [21 ha]; Alba Fucens [34 ha]; Interamna [23 ha]; Lunae [24 ha]; and Falerii [31 ha] ). The only other sites on an analogous scale discussed here are Fregellae (about 90 ha, but destroyed in 125 BC), and Aquileia (80 ha), where the city's strategic and commercial position on the Adriatic, and its connections with the Danube frontier, clearly made it a regional centre of considerable importance. Ceraudo indeed highlights the large scale of Aquinum, especially after the arrival of the colonists, and tentatively suggests an urban population of 25,000 in the mid imperial period (Anon, n.d.), but rightly stresses the need for further investigations in the urban centre. Another site discussed here, Lucus Feroniae, also received a late Republican colonial settlement, an early 1st-century BC date for which has been proposed by Stanco; if so, the formal title of the community, Colonia Iulia Felix Lucus Feroniae, suggests that there may have been a further colonial intervention, later in the century (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Despite this, as we have seen, there were few residents in the urban centre of Lucus Feroniae. Just as mid-Republican Latin colonies displayed diversity in their urban form, perhaps late Republican veteran colonies did too, reflecting the fact that such settlements tended to be imposed on already existing centres of population. There is still much more to be learnt about the cities of Roman Italy: alongside their own very substantial contributions, the papers in this volume are both suggesting new questions, and providing ways in which archaeologists and historians might attempt to answer them.

    "title": "A novel view of the destruction of Pompeii during the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius (Italy): syn-eruptive earthquakes as an additional cause of building collapse and deaths",
    "abstract": "The ancient city of Pompeii, destroyed by the 79 CE Plinian eruption of Vesuvius, is one of the most famous archaeological sites worldwide and an open-air laboratory for many disciplines. The destruction of Pompeii has so far been reconstructed in terms of a succession of volcanic phenomena and related effects, identified as the accumulation of pumice lapilli on roofs and dynamic pressure exerted by pyroclastic currents on buildings, and neglecting the potential effects of the syn-eruptive seismicity, the occurrence of which is beautifully described by an erudite eyewitness to the catastrophe, Pliny the Younger. During a recent excavation in the Insula dei Casti Amanti, in the central part of Pompeii, the peculiar evidence of building collapses, that overwhelmed two individuals, has been uncovered. The multidisciplinary investigation, involving archaeology, volcanology, and anthropology, gathered information on the construction technique of the masonry structures, the volcanological stratigraphy, the traumatic pattern of bone fractures of the skeletons, along with the detection of the wall displacements, that led to archaeoseismological considerations. The merging of the data has highlighted the need of an updated perspective in the assessment of the damage at Pompeii during the 79 CE eruption, by considering the syn-eruptive seismicity as a factor contributing to the destruction of the city and death of the inhabitants. By comparing the attitude and characteristics of different types of damage, and after ruling out any other possible damaging event, our conclusions point to the occurrence of syn-eruptive earthquake-induced failures of masonry structures. The structural collapses, based on our stratigraphic and volcanological data, are chronologically consistent with the beginning of the caldera-forming phase of the eruption which was accompanied by strong seismic shocks. The crush injuries of the skeletons of the two individuals are consistent with severe compression traumas and analogous to those shown by individuals involved in modern earthquakes testifying that, apart from other volcanic phenomena, the effects of syn-eruptive seismicity may be relevant. These outcomes lay the foundation for a more extensive study concerning the assessment of the Frontiers in Earth Science 01 frontiersin.org Sparice et al. 10.3389/feart.2024.1386960 contribution of the syn-eruptive seismic destruction at Pompeii and open new perspectives for volcanological, archaeoseismological and paleopathological studies.",
    "full_text": "Large explosive eruptions are characterized by the high-speed discharge into the atmosphere of a mixture of gas, liquid and solid particles that can be transported upward, forming sustained eruption columns up to tens of kilometers high, or can collapse and spread laterally, forming pyroclastic currents (e.g., (Woods, 1995)(Anon, n.d.)(Cioni & Pistolesi, 2015). Large eruptions are often preceded and accompanied by a significant seismic activity (Williams & Self, 1983)(Anon, n.d.)(Yokoyama, 2001)(Anon, 2008)(Mcnutt & Roman, 2015)(Arzilli et al., 2019). Pre-or syn-eruptive seismicity represents an additional threat for settlements in volcanic areas and a cause of damage to buildings, and possibly loss of life, making the assessment of the seismic hazard necessary in addition to the volcanic hazards associated mainly with tephra fallout accumulation and impact of pyroclastic currents (e.g., (Pomonis et al., 1999)(Zobin et al., 2001)(Anon, n.d.)(Zuccaro et al., 2004). Going back in time, evidence of seismicity associated with volcanic activity, and related effects, can be found in historical accounts (e.g., the 1631 sub-Plinian eruption of Vesuvius; (Anon, 1632)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 1632) or can be detected in ancient settlements struck by volcanic catastrophes. Two outstanding examples are the Akrotiri settlement, located on the island of Thera (Santorini, Greece), destroyed by the 3.6 ka Minoan Plinian eruption (Anon, n.d.)(Cioni et al., 2000), and the ancient city of Pompeii, located 9.5 km south-east of Vesuvius (Naples, Italy; Figure 1), ravaged during the 79 CE Plinian eruption (Anon, n.d.)(Cioni et al., 2003), also known as \"Pompeii eruption\". In about 2 days, the ancient Pompeii was buried under a thick pyroclastic blanket consisting of a ∼3 m thick pumice fall deposit overlaid by a sequence of ash deposits emplaced by successive pyroclastic currents. Following the first excavations started in 1748 (Maiuri, 1958), systematic archaeological investigations have unearthed most of the city that has become a landmark in the cultural landscape of Vesuvius (Vito et al., 2023) and one of the most important archaeological sites worldwide. The interplay among the succession of volcanic phenomena, the eruptive and emplacement mechanisms, and the urban structure of Pompeii resulted in a well-documented sequence of damage to buildings and death of the inhabitants (Sigurdsson et al., 1982)(Lovejoy, 1985)(Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Cioni et al., 2000)(Yokoyama & Marturano, 1997)(Varone & Marturano, 1997)(Anon, n.d.)(Luongo et al., 2003)(Ghedini et al., 2003)(Giuseppe, 2021)(Carolis & Patricelli, 2003)(Gurioli et al., 2005)(Anon, n.d.)(Marturano & Varone, 2005)(Zanella et al., 2007)(Mastrolorenzo et al., 2010)(Scandone et al., 2019)(Ruggieri et al., 2020)(Scarpati et al., 2020)(Anon, 2021)(Dellino et al., 2020)(Anon, 2021)(Anon, n.d.). Before the eruption, Pompeii was struck by historically and archaeologically documented earthquakes, the strongest of which occurred on 5 February 62-63 CE (the exact date is uncertain) resulting in severe damage to buildingsthroughoutthecity(e.g., (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Dessales, 2022). Moreover, volcanic tremors and strong seismic shocks also accompanied the eruption, between the first and second day of the event, as reported by Pliny the Younger in his letters (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) to Tacitus. Despite the extensive literature concerning the destruction caused by volcanic phenomena and damage due to the seismic events that occurred before the eruption, notably no evidence has been reported so far of syn-eruptive earthquake-induced damage at Pompeii. The lack of this information likely arises from the difficulties in identifying such type of evidence during the archaeological excavation, in a context where devastation has been primarily caused by, and always exclusively attributed to, primary volcanic phenomena (pumice lapilli fallout accumulation and pyroclastic currents flowage) whose impact may have disguised or obliterated the effects generated by syn-eruptive seismicity. This possibly resulted in an incomplete history of destruction. In fact, unlike the cases described in literature dealing with the archaeological traces of past earthquakes, the study of the co-seismic effects in Pompeii and in the other Roman cities struck by the 79 CE eruption is complicated by the intertwining between seismicity and volcanic phenomena. The rapid succession of volcanic phenomena and earthquakes, or their coincidence, is a pivotal issue for determining their combined effects on buildings, based on different eruption scenarios at Vesuvius, which lead to a progressive deterioration of the building's resistance (Anon, n.d.). For example, earthquakes may trigger the collapse of buildings already conditioned by a vertical load of a fall deposit. Alternatively, the dynamic pressure (i.e., the lateral load exerted by the flow process over buildings, e.g., (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) of a pyroclastic current may affect buildings already weakened by seismic shakings. The positive feature is that pyroclastic deposits, engulfing the buildings, freeze the exact moment of destruction and related evidence, protecting them from further break-up due to any type of decay (not considering the breaching of walls caused by the excavation of exploratory tunnels in both past centuries and more recent times, which are extensively documented in Pompeii, e.g., (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2021)(Argento et al., 2024)(Ghedini et al., 2003). In addition, some damage and related repairs in Pompeii have been associated with seismicity occurred prior to the 79 CE eruption, in some cases shortly (days) before the catastrophe (e.g., (Varone, 1993)(Anon, 2000)(Anon, 2005). Based on this evidence, the seismic swarm, precursor of the impending eruption, may have provoked structural weaknesses in the buildings, increasing their vulnerability and reducing their strength against the following volcanic/seismic processes. Furthermore, coseismic site effects due to the local geological and geomorphological features, regarded as aspects conditioning the damage in ancient towns (Hinojosa, 2023), probably also played a role in the distribution of the damage in Pompeii (e.g., (Amato et al., 2022). Satellite map of Pompeii archaeological site with subdivision in regiones, indicated by Roman numerals (I-IX), and insulae (white blocks). The locations cited in the text are reported: CA= Insula dei Casti Amanti (IX, 12); Pol= Iulius Polybius' house (IX, 13); Iuc= Caecilius Iucundus' house (V, 1); Forum= Foro Civile; Cap= Capitolium; TC= Terme Centrali (IX, 4); TS= Terme Stabiane (VII, 1); Sta= Stabianus' house (Anon, n.d.). Inset: location of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Terzigno with respect to Vesuvius. Here, we report the peculiar evidence of sudden structural damage and building collapses which involved two individuals, whose skeletons were recovered in the sequence of pyroclastic material and wall debris. The archaeological discovery was unearthed during the ongoing excavation campaign in the socalled Insula dei Casti Amanti (Insula of the Chaste Lovers), in the central part of Pompeii (Figure 1). The excavation was carried out by a multidisciplinary team that involves experts in the field of archaeology, volcanology, anthropology, and archaeoseismology in order to thoroughly assess all the fundamental aspects: the identification of the construction techniques of the Roman building, the detailed reconstruction of the 79 CE stratigraphy and its relation to the structure, the attitude and orientation of the wall failures and their stratigraphic position and, finally, the traumatic pattern of bone fractures of the skeletons of the two individuals. The stratigraphic, archaeological, and volcanological data, integrated with the severity of the crush injuries of the skeletons and the characteristics of the building collapses, have provided information for archaeoseismological considerations pointing to the occurrence of earthquake-induced damage, previously unrecognized, associated with the beginning of caldera-forming phase of the eruption. The 79 CE eruption is well known to have been the first Plinian event described by an eyewitness, Pliny the Younger, and one of the most studied Vesuvius eruptions (see (Anon, n.d.) for a review of the eruption studies). Overall, the eruption was characterized by three main phases: a transient, phreatomagmatic, opening phase followed by a paroxysmal phase, with the onset of a sustained to collapsing Plinian eruption column, and a final caldera-forming to phreatomagmatic phase during which successive pyroclastic currents spread around the volcano (e.g., (Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Macedonio et al., 1988)(Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.)(Stiros, 1996)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Lirer et al., 1993)(Anon, n.d.). The 79 CE pyroclastic sequence, with a particular focus on Pompeii, has been studied by many authors who provided detailed stratigraphic frameworks (Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.)(Varone & Marturano, 1997)(Marturano & Varone, 2005)(Scarpati et al., 2020). Here, the 79 CE stratigraphic framework is borrowed from (Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.) who arrange the stratigraphy in eight Eruption Units (EU1-EU8), and minor sub-units, having different dispersal, areal distribution, and emplacement mechanisms. Due to the distance from Vesuvius and the different areal distribution of the products, the 79 CE stratigraphy at Pompeii (Figure 2) is composed only of five (EU2f, EU3f, EU4, EU7, and EU8) out of eight EUs. The opening phreatomagmatic phase produced an easterly-dispersed accretionary lapilli-bearing ash fall deposit (EU1) which did not affect Pompeii. A stratified fall deposit made up of white (EU2f) to grey (EU3f) pumice lapilli and blocks, dispersed toward south-east, represents the product of the Plinian phase. The white to grey colour transition reflects a compositional variation of magma from phonolite to tephri-phonolite (Cioni et al., 1995)(Anon, n.d.)(Melluso et al., 2022). The pumice fall deposit in Pompeii attains a maximum total thickness of 2.8-2.9 m (Lirer et al., 1973)(Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). At least four partial collapses of the Plinian eruption column generated pyroclastic currents whose ash deposits are interspersed in the Plinian fall deposit. Only the last of these pyroclastic currents affected Pompeii, emplacing a thin ash layer (EU3pfi sub-unit) a few (Anon, n.d.) centimeters below the top of EU3f, just outside the north-western city walls (Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.) and in the northernmost part of Pompeii (Scarpati et al., 2020). The grey pumice deposit is capped by two ash layers separated by a thin horizon of pumice lapilli (EU3pftot sub-unit). This unit records the total collapse of the Plinian eruption column. The transition to the caldera-forming and final phreatomagmatic phase was marked by an abrupt variation of the eruptive and depositional mechanisms of the products, emplaced mainly by multiple pyroclastic currents alternated with brief \"lithic-rich\" fall phases (Ceccaroni et al., 2009). EU4 is formed by a basal, centimeter-thick, lithic lapillirich fall deposit (EU4bl), overlaid by a decimeter-to meter-thick, grey ash deposit containing pumice lapilli, accretionary lapilli and deep-seated lithic fragments (EU4pf), capped by an accretionary lapilli-bearing ash layer. EU4pf resulted from the most powerful pyroclastic current that overran Pompeii. EU4 is associated with the initial destabilization of the shallow plumbing system and fracturing of the magma chamber roof. This marks the beginning of the caldera collapse accompanied by significant seismicity (Cioni et al., 1999)(Anon, n.d.). EU5 and EU6 are matrix-supported lithic-enriched deposits and coarse lithic breccias emplaced by pyroclastic currents, confined in paleovalleys on the slopes of Vesuvius, that mark the definitive caldera collapse (Cioni et al., 1999). EU7 consists of two lithic lapilli-rich fall layers separated by an ash layer and overlaid by an accretionary lapilli-bearing ash layer (EU7pf; (Gurioli et al., 2007). EU8 consists mainly of a stratified sequence, up to 1 m thick, of accretionary lapilli-bearing ash layers emplaced by successive phreatomagmatic pyroclastic current pulses during the waning phase of the eruption. Seismicity occurred during the first century CE, prior to the 79 CE eruption, and related effects in Pompeii have been debated for many decades. Information arises by integrating historical sources and archaeological evidence. A first earthquake, which occurred in 37 CE, is reported by Suetonius in his book (Tiberius 74, 2) devoted to the emperor Tiberius. Its estimated magnitude (M) is 4-4.5 (Cubellis & Marturano, 2013). The major seismic event before the 79 CE eruption occurred in 62-63 CE. Two different estimates of the magnitude have been proposed: 5.1 (Cubellis & Marturano, 1999)(Anon, 2013)(Cubellis et al., 2007) and 5.8 (CFTI5med catalogue, (Guidoboni et al., 2018)(Anon, n.d.). The damage associated with this earthquake has been estimated, according to the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) scale, with Intensity (I) 9 at Pompeii, 8-9 at Herculaneum and 7-8 at Naples (Imbò, 1974)(Adam, 1989)(Guidoboni et al., 2018)(Anon, n.d.). The occurrence of this earthquake is documented by different Latin authors although the exact date is being debated (e.g., (Hine, 1984)(Savino et al., 2009)(Dessales, 2022). Tacitus (Annales XV, 22) refers to 5 February 62 CE while Seneca (Naturales Questiones VI, 1) gives 63 CE as the year of the event. The 62-63 CE earthquake resulted in such extensive damage, still visible in Pompeii buildings, as repaired fractures and deformations (e.g., (Ruggieri, 2017)(Amato et al., 2022)(Dessales, 2022), that it is believed that repair works were still under way 17 years later, making the city a large construction site (Anon, 1942) when Vesuvius awoke. Two bas-reliefs, found in the in the house of Caecilius Iucundus (Adam, 1989)(Anon, 2000)(Anon, 2005), are evocative of the effects of this earthquake in two locations: the Capitolium, in the northern part of the Foro Civile, and Porta Vesuvio (Figure 1). Aftershocks were felt for several days after the major event. The 62-63 CE earthquake was followed by another seismic event in 64 CE (Anon, n.d.)(Cubellis & Marturano, 2013) documented by Suetonius and Tacitus who reported the shaking of a theatre in Naples during an artistic performance of the emperor Nero (Simone, 1993)(Pappalardo, 1993)(Anon, 1995)(Cubellis et al., 2007)(Greca & F, 2007)(Marturano, 2008). The effects of the seismicity following the 62-63 CE major event have often been underestimated. According to (Anon, 2000)(Anon, 2005), the reports concerning the 62-63 CE earthquake provided scholars with the most valid cause-effect relationship to justify the extensive repair works throughout Pompeii at the time of the eruption. The international meeting \"Archäologie und Seismologie: la regione vesuviana dal 62 al 79 d.C.: problemi archeologici e sismologici\" held in Boscoreale (near Pompeii), in November 1993, convened by the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, the Osservatorio Vesuviano and the Archaeological Superintendence of Pompeii (currently Pompeii Archaeological Park), gathered scientific contributions reporting evidence of different phases of repair works related to a prolonged seismicity. Examples include repairs and reinforcement interventions at the Terme Stabiane (Figure 1), attributed to the effects of the 64 CE earthquake besides that of 62-63 CE (Ruggieri et al., 2018), and consolidation works of edifices built after 62-63 CE (Jacobelli, 1993)(Pappalardo, 1993) such as at the Terme Centrali (Figure 1). Other archaeological clues that point to ongoing repair works are represented by the discovery, in many houses, of goods and furniture set aside, piles of lime, building materials neatly stacked, wall plaster refurbishment, incomplete wall decorations and frescoes (e.g., (Allison, 1993)(Simone, 1993)(Ling, 1995)(Nappo, 1993)(Varone, 1993)(Anon, 2000). Some of the events responsible for the damage to buildings have been attributed to the time interval between 72 and 78 CE (Anon, 2006) testifying to a period of persistent seismicity that plagued the city for many years prior to the 79 CE eruption (Allison, 2003)(Anon, 2008)(Scandone et al., 2019). In some cases, evidence points to the effects of seismicity shortly before the catastrophe, during the year before the eruption (Anon, 2006) and up to a few days prior to it (Varone, 1993)(Anon, 2000)(Anon, 2005), in the form of warped mosaic floors in the Insula dei Casti Amanti (Figure 1) and repair works to the non-functioning sewers along the eastern alley of the same insula, where septic tanks were found filled with pumice lapilli. According to the cited authors, it appears unlikely that sewers that served an entire block, including rich dwellings, were left unrepaired for a long time before the eruption. The seismicity, precursor of the impending eruption, is also accounted by Pliny the Younger (Epistolae VI, 20) who reported that tremors were felt for several days before the eruption, but they caused little alarm as people in Campania region were accomplished to such phenomena (Praecesserat per multos dies tremor minus formidolosus, quia Campaniae solitus). Ultimately, the picture that emerges is that of a city that, between 62 and 79 CE, suffered the effects of recurring earthquakes and volcanic tremors that forced the inhabitants to undertake continuous reconstruction, renovation and restoration works until the eruption. Stratigraphic sequence of the 79 CE eruption with a focus on Pompeii archaeological site. Eruption Units (EU) are from (Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.) and (Gurioli et al., 2007). Units lacking in Pompeii are reported in italics. The pumice fall deposit is interrupted by several ash layers (at least four) emplaced by pyroclastic currents generated by partial collapses of the Plinian column; only the last of these events (EU3pfi sub-unit) reached Pompeii. The maximum height reached by the Plinian column is from (Carey & Sigurdsson, 1987). The synchronization of the events is from (Sigurdsson et al., 1985) and (Anon, n.d.). Vertical coloured lines mark deposits associated with the various phases (and sub-phases) of the eruption. frontiersin.org (Anon, n.d.) 4 Syn-eruptive seismicity No clear evidence of damage related to syn-eruptive earthquakes has been reported in Pompeii so far. (Varone, 1993) and (Marturano & Varone, 2005) reported the finding of masonry blocks horizontally displaced from their original positions, suggesting that seismic solicitations related to the eruption (or soon after) should be considered in assessing the damage. However, the occurrence of syn-eruptive seismicity is documented by Pliny the Younger who reported seismic shakings felt in Misenum (∼29 km west of Vesuvius) during the night of the first day of the eruption, and violent shocks at the daybreak of the second day. The scenario depicted by Pliny the Younger's second letter (Epistulae VI, 20) to Tacitus is a vivid picture of the seismic upheavals: \"tremor (terrae)…illa vero nocte ita invaluit, ut non moveri omnia, sed everti crederentur.\" \"earthquakes…that night became so intense that everything seemed not only to be shaken but overturning. \" \"Iam hora diei prima, et adhuc dubius et quasi languidus dies…vehicla quae produci iusseramus, quamquam in planissimo campo, in contrarias partes agebantur, ac ne lapidibus quidem fulta in eodem vestigio quiescebant. \" \"It was the first hour of the day, but the light was still faint and weak.…the chariots we had ordered to be brought out, though on a level ground, were shaken back and forth and did not remain steady in their places even wedged with stones. \" The latter has been associated with the beginning of the caldera collapse phase with the emplacement of EU4 (Cioni et al., 1999)(Anon, n.d.)(Cioni et al., 2000). According to the CFTI5med catalogue (Guidoboni et al., 2018)(Anon, n.d.), the estimated M is 6 whilst the MCS Intensity is 8. (Scandone et al., 2019) drew an isoseismal map, representing the cumulative effects of the syn-eruptive seismic swarm, through the estimation of the intensity at different localities based on epigraphs documenting repair works made after the eruption. In this map, Pompeii is well within the isoseism defining Intensity 9. According to these authors, such an intensity must have caused severe damage and widespread collapse of buildings, possibly resulting from earthquakes even stronger than the main one of the 62-63 CE sequence. The urban planning of Pompeii, conceived in the mid-19th century by the archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli (Anon, 2000), is divided in nine large districts, called \"regiones\" (singular regio) and indicated by Roman numerals (I-IX), bounded by thoroughfares oriented east-west (Decumani) and north-south (Cardi). Each regio is further subdivided into numbered blocks, called \"insulae\", bounded by alleys. The Insula dei Casti Amanti is numbered as insula 12 in Regio IX and faces south onto the via dell' Abbondanza (Figure 1). Its name originates from a fresco, found in a domus (house), depicting two lovers chastely kissing. The first excavations of the façades of the buildings fronting onto the via dell' Abbondanza were undertaken in 1911 by the archaeologist Vittorio Spinazzola (Anon, 2000). A more recent, systematic excavation campaign began in 1987, continued in various phases (Anon, 2000)(Varone & Guidobaldi, 2005)(Anon, n.d.), and is still ongoing (Calvanese et al., 2021). As a result, the southern part of the insula has been unearthed, as well as the alleys that flank it to east and west. The insula includes different domus (Figure 3): the \"casa del Cenacolo Colonnato I and II\" in the south-western sector, the \"casa dei Casti Amanti\" in the southeastern sector, where the fresco after which the insula was named was found, and the \"casa dei Pittori al Lavoro\" (house of the Painters at Work) in the northern part, which is still partly buried under the pyroclastic blanket. The latter is articulated around an internal garden (viridarium) surrounded by a portico (peristilium) on three sides (north, west, and east) where piles of lime were found, evidence of ongoing restoration works (Varone, 1993)(Anon, 2000). The current excavation campaign involves rooms located in the north-eastern part of the house of the Painters at Work, close to the east alley of the insula. In two newly excavated, adjoining rooms (room A and 22 in Figure 3), we found evidence of wall failures and damage whose characteristics (stratigraphic heights, orientation, and attitude) are compared in order to reconstruct the timing of the collapses and triggering mechanisms. Furthermore, in room A, the structural collapses overwhelmed two individuals, whose skeletons have been recovered, providing important clues that have contributed, along with volcanological data and archaeoseismological considerations, to demonstrate that an updated perspective of the destruction of Pompeii during the 79 CE eruption should be considered. The two adjoining rooms (rooms A and 22 in Figure 3) are located on the ground floor, bounded to the east by the alley oriented approximately NW-SE, and are each accessed through doors opening onto room 21 (Figure 3) which, though still unexcavated and currently filled with pumice lapilli, had the function of an open courtyard. The two rooms are not interconnected; there is no door that allows direct access from one room to the other. Both rooms are delimited by load-bearing, 45 cm thick, perimeter walls built in opus africanum, a building technique consisting of small stone blocks, bonded with different types of binder, inserted between chains of large blocks in which vertical blocks alternate with horizontal ones (Anon, 2018). Room A has been partly excavated in 1988-1989. It is surrounded to south and west by rooms previously excavated, while it is bordered by room 22 to north, sharing a perimeter wall. Room A has a nearly square shape (5.25×5.12 m). It is accessed through a door, located at the western end of the north-western perimeter wall, which currently opens onto the still buried area (room 21 in Figure 3). The interior of the room is marked by two, 30 cm thick, partition walls with no load-bearing function, perpendicular to each other (Figure 3) being oriented approximately NW-SE (hereafter PW1) and NE-SW (hereafter PW2). The partition walls are built in opus incertum, a building technique consisting of irregular stones of different size bonded with mortar (e.g., (Anon, 2018). The partition walls allow to subdivide the area of room A into three rectangular-shaped sectors. The southern sector had the function of a latrine and had already been investigated down to the ground level during the previous excavation. The western sector had the function of a service kitchen, as testified by the finding of a kitchen counter located in the south-western corner. The kitchen was decommissioned at the time of the eruption as indicated by the presence of two piles of lime, one resting directly on the counter and the other one leaning against it. The presence of piles of lime is evidence that restoration and/or renovation works were also under way in this part of the house. The northern sector occupies the largest part of the room, having dimensions of 4×2.91 m. This area is accessed from the western sector through a door located at the northern end of the PW1. Here, the northeastern perimeter wall comprises a window facing the alley, whose base is 1.70 m above the ground level of the alley itself. In this part of room A, the skeletons of two individuals were found close to the partition walls. Room 22 is rectangular-shaped (5.8×3 m) with the longest side parallel to the alley. It is accessed through a door, located along the south-western perimeter wall, which opens onto the unexcavated area (room 21 in Figure 3). Two windows, having the same characteristics as described for Room A, are present in the north-eastern perimeter wall. The stratigraphy of the 79 CE pyroclastic deposits in the recently excavated rooms is described below. The stratigraphic context of each room is described separately to better highlight the different attitude and stratigraphic height of the structural damage. The stratigraphic height and the stance of the skeletons of two individuals 10.3389/feart.2024.1386960 found in room A, as well as their relationship with the wall collapses, are also described in detail. As previously reported, the southern sector (latrine) had already been completely excavated; therefore, our stratigraphic description is limited to the western and northern sectors. In the western sector (kitchen), a deposit consisting of coarse, angular, white pumice lapilli (EU2f) was resting directly on the ground, with an uniform thickness of ∼75 cm (Figure 4A). EU2f was capped by anthropically reworked material left by the past excavations. No evidence of roof/attic collapse has been found on the ground or in the pumice lapilli deposit. Eight intact amphorae were found in a row on the ground, propped upright against the southwestern perimeter wall and embedded within the pumice lapilli deposit. It is worth noting that the door from which this sector (and the room) is accessed was completely blocked by a pumice lapilli fall deposit, consisting mainly of white pumice. In the northern sector, the ground was covered by an accumulation of grey pumice lapilli (EU3f) forming a heap, whose apex (∼1.3 m) corresponded with the window opening in the northeastern perimeter wall. The heap of grey pumice lapilli thinned out in all directions, reaching the walls. Plaster fragments, forming thin accumulations, were found interspersed within the lapilli heap close to the walls. A major collapse unit, resulting from the failure and break-up of the upper part of PW1, lay directly on a few centimeters of grey lapilli. The collapse unit consists of two features (Figures 4B,C): a large masonry fragment, measuring 200×140×30 cm, and two heap-shaped accumulations of wall debris to the sides of the masonry fragment and partly overlying it. The large masonry fragment is positioned with its long side upright and leaning laterally against the remaining, in situ, portion of the same wall. The position of the collapsed wall fragment is the result of the horizontal displacement towards the north-east, after sliding over a sub-horizontal shear plane located between 60 and 70 cm above the ground, and downward collapse without breakage, toppling or overturning. The heap-shaped accumulations of wall debris, consisting of centimeter-sized masonry rubble, pieces of mortar, and plaster fragments, were in turn covered by coarse, angular, white pumice lapilli. The deposition of white lapilli was fed from breaches in the PW1. A skeleton (individual 1; Figure 5), lying on its right side, facing the PW1, was found in the south-western corner of this sector, resting on a few centimeters of grey pumice lapilli and directly overlaid by the collapse unit. One of the heaps of wall debris covered the skull, the torso, the upper limbs and part of the lower limbs, leaving the back exposed which was facing the center of the room (Figure 5). The right hand was lying directly under the collapsed masonry fragment. A second skeleton (individual 2; Figure 5), lying on its left side, facing the north-eastern perimeter wall, was found at the same stratigraphic position in the south-eastern corner of this sector. The skull, torso and the lower limbs lay on the lapilli heap while the right foot was directly on the ground. A masonry fragment, 80 cm long, fallen from the upper part of the PW2, lay directly on the right lower limb and pelvis (Figure 5). The skeleton was covered by a heterogeneous deposit consisting of pumice lapilli, plaster fragments detached from the adjacent walls, and subordinate masonry blocks deriving from the collapse of the PW2. At the time of discovery, only the upper part of the skull and the left knee emerged from the accumulation of wall fragments and pumice. In both cases, the internal volume of the skeleton was filled with loose material (wall debris for individual 1; wall debris and pumice clasts for individual 2) that re-settled after the decomposition of the corpses. The presence of the heap of grey lapilli to the north-east and the collapse unit to the south-west resulted in a concave profile which was filled with a grey ash deposit containing pumice lapilli (EU4pf). The ash deposit covered individual 1's back and partly enveloped the skull penetrating through the voids of the wall debris. Likewise, the ash engulfed individual 2's skull, which emerged from the lapilli, and partly penetrated the lapilli deposit, filling the space between the grains and touching the individual 2's back. Close to individual 2, the limit of the ash deposit showed a circular shape which was apparent, although ephemeral, in the accumulation of lapilli. It could represent the trace of a rotted (wooden) object. The stratigraphy in this room (Figure 6) is characterized by the same three stratigraphic units (EU2f, EU3f and EU4pf) arranged in a less complicated framework. The ground was covered by accumulations of pumice lapilli (EU2f and EU3f) whose maximum thickness corresponded with the door opening in the south-western wall and the two windows in the north-eastern wall. The pumice lapilli were mainly grey. White lapilli were found only close to the door. Similar to room A, these accumulations of lapilli resulted in a longitudinally elongated, concave profile capped by a grey ash deposit containing pumice lapilli (EU4pf), burying the rest of the room. Also in this room, no evidence of roof/attic collapse has been found. A collapsed wall, fragmented in two large blocks having total dimensions of 128×70×45 cm, coming from the south-eastward toppling of the north-western perimeter wall, was found in the pyroclastic sequence (Figure 6). The masonry blocks lay horizontally on the grey ash and were engulfed by the same ash deposit (EU4pf). The thickness of the ash deposit underlying the collapsed wall was at its maximum (22 cm) along the longitudinal axis of the room while it thinned out, moving laterally, towards the north-eastern and south-western walls due to the concave profile of the underlying lapilli deposit. The collapse resulted in a channel-shaped breach in the north-western wall having a maximum depth of 1.3 m (Figure 6). The biological profile, based on the macroscopic characteristics of the skull and pelvic girdle (Bertoldi et al., 2009), indicates that both individuals were male. The age determination, based on the Suchey-Brooks pubic symphysis scoring system (Brooks & Suchey, 1990) when possible, the modifications of the auricular surface (Lovejoy et al., 1985), and the occlusal surface of the maxillary and mandibular teeth (Lovejoy, 1985), suggests a mature-senile age (≥55 years) for both. This age is further suggested by the complete ossification of the manubriosternal joint as well as the degree of obliteration of cranial sutures. The individual 1 shows a high number of rib fractures (more than 20 per hemithorax) resulting in a complex injury pattern typical of blunt chest trauma (Figure 7A). In general, rib fractures represent the most frequent type of bone fractures. In about fifty Photographs of the major collapse unit along the PW1 in Room A: (A, B) cross section view (approximately from the NW), in various phases during the excavation, of the collapsed masonry fragment leaning against the residue in situ of the same wall; note the white pumice lapilli filling the western sector (kitchen; right side of the wall) and partly covering the collapsed block in the northern sector (left side of the wall); once the lapilli deposit had been removed, two accumulations of wall debris were found to the side of the collapsed masonry fragment; (C) panoramic view (from the north) of the collapse unit. In (B, C), the skeleton of the individual 1 is visible. percent (50%) of all rib fracture cases, three or more consecutive ribs are broken being also referred to as serial rib fractures or flail chest (Liebsch et al., 2019). Combinations of multiple rib fractures can result in instability and loss of integrity of ribs and chest walls causing the harming of the inner organs, often with fatal consequences (Dogrul et al., 2020). In addition to the very severe pattern of rib fractures, there are also significant fractures of the facial skull and skull base as well as pelvic fractures. The latter, in compression damage, tends to adhere to a certain typology, usually located at the level of the pubic bone (the most fragile portion of the pelvic girdle). Furthermore, the combination of the avulsions of the vertebral spinous processes and additional fractures of variable severity in the upper and lower limbs enhances the traumatic scenario. Individual 2 shows a relatively similar pattern of fractures, although some differences are established (such as the presence of a higher number of fractures on the right hemithorax, the one directly exposed to the trauma, while the left one must be sunk View from the south of the Room 22. In the foreground the topppled wall, fragmented into two blocks, laying on a grey ash deposit (EU4pf) in turn resting on the concave profile of the pumice lapilli deposit; note the thinning of the ash deposit towards the north-eastern perimeter wall while it keeps a constant thickness along the longitudinal axis of the room. In the background, the north-western perimeter wall showing a channel-shaped breach (dashed line). Inset: detail of the collapsed wall and the underlying stratigraphy (view from the SE). into the underlying lapilli deposit). Unlike the individual 1, found directly under the main collapse unit of PW1, individual 2 was mainly buried at the level of the lower limbs by a large wall fragment detached from the PW2. Plaster fragments were in direct contact with the right femur and released red pigments that coloured its surface. At the site of greatest impact, the right iliac wing showed an extremely important cracking scenario resulting in very extensive and comminuted fractures. The same applies to the right radius and ulna characterized by a fracture defined in the literature as \"Both Bone Forearm Fractures\" (Anon, n.d.), and to the right tibia and fibula directly crushed by the large masonry fragment. Again, costal traumas, combined with facial and skull base traumas, point to a hypothesis of immediate or semi-immediate death. Interestingly, the individual 2 had a series of previous well-repaired fractures with bone remodelling which afflicted both rib cage and wrists. Importantly, the position of the skeleton, huddled on his left side with his left hand protecting his head (Figure 7B), and the faint traces of a circular object directly above the skeleton (Figure 7C) suggest that the individual was aware of the danger and attempted to take cover. The detection of past seismic effects is a complex task as the traces of past earthquakes in archaeological stratigraphic successions and within monuments, the object of the so-called \"archaeoseismology\", are seldom univocal. The detection of syn-eruptive seismic effects is even more complex due to the intertwining between seismicity and volcanic phenomena as previously described. The literature indicates that the cause-effect relationship between archaeological evidence of destruction and seismic shaking is not straightforward and often questionable (e.g., (Karcz & Kafri, 1978)(Guidoboni & Bianchi, 1995)(Stiros, 1996)(Galadini et al., 2006)(Marco, 2008)(Hinzen et al., 2010)(Jusseret et al., 2013)(Anon, 2023). For this reason, a normal procedure adopted in archaeoseismology is the exclusion of possible causes of destruction other than those associated with seismic solicitation (e.g., (Stiros, 1996)(Galadini et al., 2006)(Marco, 2008)(Hinzen et al., 2010)(Stiros & Pytharouli, 2014). Looking for maximum consistency with earthquake damage/destruction, most archaeoseismological works are based on: 1) the evidence of geological co-seismic effects in archaeological sites, mainly surface faulting and sudden areal vertical motion (e.g., (Pirazzoli et al., 1992)(Stiros, 1996)(Hancock & Altunel, 1997)(Galadini & Galli, 1999)(Akyüz & Altunel, 2001)(Stiros & Papageorgiou, 2001)(Marco et al., 2003)(Galli & Naso, 2009)(Altunel et al., 2009)(Schweppe et al., 2021); 2) the areal approach based on the correlation of destruction layers, i.e., horizons in the archaeological stratigraphy showing evidence of sudden destruction caused by human and/or natural agents (Galadini et al., 2006)(Anon, 2013), throughout a territory or an archaeological area (e.g., (Guidoboni et al., 2000)(Stiros & Papageorgiou, 2001)(Galli & Bosi, 2002)(Galadini & Galli, 2004)(Ceccaroni et al., 2009)(Galadini et al., 2022); 3) the estimation of the consistency of the damage by seismic actions through structural evaluations or modelling ground motion and structural response (e.g., (Anon, n.d.)(Korjenkov & Mazor, 1999)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Hinzen, 2005)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Hinzen et al., 2013)(Giuseppe, 2021)(Kázmér & Major, 2015). In some cases, the different approaches have also benefitted from attempts to quantify the reliability of the seismic hypothesis by using a plausibility matrix or summarizing the consistency of alternative causes of destruction (e.g., (Hinzen et al., 2013)(Giuseppe, 2021)(Galadini et al., 2006)(Anon, 2023). Considering the issues here summarized, we interpret the 79 CE stratigraphy and the associated archaeological destruction layers, along with the condition of the skeletons of the two individuals, to infer the triggering mechanisms of the wall collapses and the timing in the course of the eruption. The merging of the volcanological, archaeological, and anthropological data, along with the analysis of the wall failures and displacements, led to archaeoseismological considerations that suggest an additional syn-eruptive cause of destruction of Pompeii and death of the inhabitants beyond volcanic phenomena. In this light, our discussions are presented according to the following rationale: 1) we interpret the stratigraphic features of the deposits in terms of the sequence of events and timing of the destruction of the two adjacent rooms, 2) we compare the typical damage caused by primary volcanic phenomena, as addressed in the volcanological literature, with that found in the recently excavated rooms in order to highlight the similarities (room 22) and differences (room A) in the characteristics and attitude of the failures, in turn reflecting different dynamics and triggering mechanisms, 3) we propose an archaeoseismological interpretation of the mechanism which triggered the wall collapses in room A, after ruling out any other possible cause, 4) the traumatic pattern of the skeletons is discussed to infer the causes of death. The 79 CE pyroclastic sequence, that is easily recognizable in open space, exhibits anomalous characteristics and thicknesses when the volcanic phenomena interact with buildings (Anon, n.d.)(Luongo et al., 2003)(Gurioli et al., 2005). Here, the sequence of destruction is reconstructed for the investigated rooms of the house of the Painters at Work and illustrated in Figure 8. Although the stratigraphic record is incomplete in room A due to past excavations, the available data still permit to suggest a sequence of destruction. Since the exact date of the eruption is being debated (late August to November, e.g., Di Giuseppe, 2021; (Anon, n.d.)(Hinojosa, 2023)(Altamura & Doronzo, 2022)(Anon, 2022), we simply refer to the first and second day of the eruption. The proposed scenario is described in chronological order, following the chronology of the events as reconstructed by (Sigurdsson et al., 1985) and (Anon, n.d.). At the beginning of the Plinian phase, around 1 p.m., white pumice lapilli fell on Pompeii. After 7 h, the lapilli fallout switched to grey pumice. The resulting deposit (EU2f and EU3f) was found in both rooms as a consequence of the penetration through openings (doors and windows). In room A, the white pumice deposit (EU2f) has only been recognized in the western sector (kitchen), where it shows an almost uniform thickness (∼75 cm). We are aware that the top of this deposit was affected by past excavations due to: 1) the uniformness of the thickness, 3) the truncated horizontal surface and 3) the presence of anthropically reworked material on top. Evidence comes from a photo (Figure 9), found in the photo archive of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, dating to the early excavations of the Room A in 1988-1989. The photo was taken from the southern sector (latrine) looking at the western sector which is filled with a thick pumice lapilli deposit. Just behind Stratigraphic relationship between pyroclastic deposits and structural collapses and sequence of the events in the investigated rooms; (A) NE-SW cross section (view from the NW) in Room A whose profile (A-B transect) is showed in Figure 3: i) during the Plinian phase, white pumice lapilli (EU2f) penetrate the western sector (kitchen) through a door in the north-western perimeter wall and fill most of the space (see also Figure 9); grey pumice lapilli (EU3f) penetrate the northern sector through the window in the north-eastern perimeter wall, facing the alley; ii) after the end of the Plinian phase, the out-of-plane failure of the PW1 occurs. A large masonry fragment is horizontally (north-easterly) displaced and slipped down as a result of a seismic solicitation. Accumulations of wall debris result from the break-up of the same wall. White pumice lapilli penetrate from the western sector, through breaches in the PW1, covering the collapse unit; iii) at beginning of the caldera-forming phase, the EU4pf parental current penetrates the room and emplaces an ash deposit that entombs the underlying pumice accumulations and the collapse units (and the skeletons). When the new excavations began, the primary pyroclastic deposits were covered by a layer of reworked material left by past excavations. (B) NW-SE cross section (view from the SW) in Rom 22 whose profile (C-D transect) is showed in Figure 3. Pumice lapilli penetrate the space through the openings (door and windows) during the Plinian phase. During the early phase of caldera formation, the EU4pf parental current, coming from the north-west, hit the north-western wall causing the upper part to collapse being pulled down south-eastward. The collapsed wall blocks rest on, and are capped by, the ash deposit emplaced by the same pyroclastic current. The south-eastern perimeter wall, shared with room A (Figure 3), is not damaged at all. the PW2, the sloping surface of the pumice deposit is visible. We cannot completely exclude that the sloping surface of the pumice deposit may have been partly accentuated by the excavation itself. However, this is further evidence in favour of the conclusion that the thickness uniformness and the horizontal surface resulted from the past archaeological excavations. Consequently, we suggest that the EU2f deposit is the residue of an accumulation of pumice lapilli that penetrated through the door, along the north-western perimeter wall, which is completely blocked by a lapilli deposit (filling the still buried room 21; Figure 3). The grey phase (EU3f) was recorded in the northern sector of room A by the presence of a grey pumice lapilli heap, whose apex corresponded with the window facing the east alley of the insula. The 79 CE pyroclastic sequence in the east alley (close to rooms A and 22) was about 5 m thick, of which 3.1-3.3 m of pumice lapilli (Patti, 2003)(Sanctis et al., 2019)(Anon, n.d.), although this thickness was not uniform and could rapidly vary along the alley due to the sliding/rolling of pumice off sloping roofs (thickening) and/or erosion (thinning) exerted by the successive pyroclastic currents. By taking into account an almost equal proportion between white and grey pumice at Pompeii (Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.), a thickness of ∼1.6 m is calculated, respectively, for EU2f and EU3f. Considering that the base of the window is 1.7 m above the ground level of the alley and that the base of EU3f was not higher than 1.6 m, we can conclude that the grey pumice progressively buried the window, penetrated the room through it and extended towards the sides of the room (Figure 8A). The same dynamics can be suggested for room 22 with pumice lapilli penetrating that space through the door along the south-western wall (opening on the unexcavated room 21; Figure 3) and through the windows along the north-eastern wall facing the alley. After the end of the grey pumice fallout (around 7 a.m. on the second day), the collapse and break-up of the partition walls in room A occurred (whose causes are investigated in the following sections) likely causing, in turn, the crumbling of a wooden attic and the death of the two individuals who tried to seek shelter in this room. The wall failure caused the white pumice lapilli from the western sector to slide and partly penetrate the northern sector, through breaches in the PW1, covering the collapse units (Figure 8A). The absence of ash coating or matrix suggests that the sliding of the pumice lapilli occurred before the arrival of the pyroclastic currents. Following the ultimate collapse of the Plinian column and the beginning of the caldera-forming to phreatomagmatic phase of the eruption, a succession of pyroclastic currents overran the city. The pyroclastic currents that emplaced the EU3pftot unit were unable to penetrate the rooms. The successive EU4pf parental current arrived from the north-west and collided against the north-western wall of room 22 that happened to be perpendicular to the flow direction (Figure 8B). The dynamic pressure associated with the flow process caused the wall to be pulled down south-eastward (further evidence that led us to this conclusion is discussed in the following section). The capability of pyroclastic currents to damage buildings is testified by experimental studies (e.g., (Valentine, 1998)(Nunziante et al., 2003)(Anon, n.d.)(Zuccaro et al., 2004)(Anon, n.d.)(Spence et al., 2004)(Baxter et al., 2005), specific field-based studies in Pompeii (Varone & Marturano, 1997)(Anon, n.d.)(Cioni et al., 2000)(Anon, n.d.)(Gurioli et al., 2005)(Marturano & Varone, 2005), as well as the estimation of the flow dynamic pressure based on external fragments found in EU4pf and entrained by the pyroclastic current (Anon, n.d.) or on the structural analysis of the damage to walls (Ruggieri et al., 2020). The presence of an ash layer, up to 22 cm thick, underlying the collapsed wall fragments suggest that the toppling was instantaneous but did not happen at the first arrival of the pyroclastic current (probably due to the partial protection of buildings located in the northern sector of the Insula dei Casti Amanti which is still buried). The pyroclastic current had time to penetrate the room, likely from openings not completely buried by the pumice lapilli, emplacing the ash on top of the lapilli deposit. The dynamic pressure exerted by the pyroclastic current, then, caused the north-western wall to rapidly collapse, crumbling on the ash deposit and breaking into two fragments upon landing, and then being entombed by the same ash. The pyroclastic current travelled south-eastward across room 22 then, after a few meters, collided against the successive perimeter wall (separating rooms 22 and A; Figure 3; Figure 8B). The pyroclastic current was unable to damage such wall likely as a consequence of the temporary loss of kinetic energy caused by interaction with the previous wall (Anon, n.d.)(Gurioli et al., 2005), after which it had mainly a depositional behaviour. The current penetrated the room A (Figure 8A), progressively emplacing an ash deposit that capped the skeletons of the two individuals and the collapse units. The stratigraphic position of the main collapse unit in room A suggests that the wall failure occurred after the end of the Plinian phase (that lasted about 18 h) and before the first arrival of the EU4pf parental current in the early morning of the second day (from 8 a.m.). The death of the two individuals, whose skeletons are strictly related to the collapse of the partition walls, falls within the same chronostratigraphic interval. The accumulation of pumice lapilli during the Plinian phase of the eruption, with an average sedimentation rate of 15 cm/h (Sigurdsson et al., 1982)(Lovejoy, 1985) in open space, caused several roofs to collapse under the vertical load of the accumulating deposit on flat or low-sloping surfaces (Anon, n.d.)(Cioni et al., 2000)(Anon, n.d.)(Ghedini et al., 2003). Typically, the damage is represented by abundant roof/attic debris and tiles, intact or in fragments, smashed on the ground and covered by the pumice lapilli or embedded within it (Figure 10A). Most of roof collapses occurred a few hours after the beginning of the Plinian phase, under a deposit thickness of 40-60 cm (Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Cioni et al., 1990)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) during the emplacement of EU2f. A vertical load may also result in the failure of vertical structures (e.g., (Anon, 1998)(Sandoval et al., 2011), such as walls or columns, which could be a secondary consequence of the roof collapse (Spence et al., 2004). This mechanism has been invoked to explain the crumbling of walls locally associated with roof collapses at Pompeii (Luongo et al., 2003)(Ghedini et al., 2003). In room A of the house of the Painters at Work, the lack of any evidence of roof collapse on the ground, and the presence of an accumulation of grey pumice lapilli penetrated through a window, suggest that the roof was still in place by the end of the Plinian phase. This is likely due to the presence of a sloping roof that drained most of pumice lapilli into the east alley and, consequently, reduced the progressive Photo showing the early excavations of the (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) (photo archive of the Pompeii Archaeological Park). The photo was taken from the southern sector (latrine) looking at the western sector (kitchen) that appears filled with pumice lapilli showing a sloping surface (behind the PW2). The blackboard, reporting the date 6 April 1989, is placed on a pile of lime resting on the kitchen counter (still buried in the photo). increase of the vertical load. In addition, the collapsed partition walls had no load-bearing function so that the vertical forces were mainly discharged on the perimeter (load-bearing) walls. A direct causeeffect relationship between the accumulation of pumice lapilli and the collapse unit in room A can be confidently excluded. Similar considerations lead to rule out the effects of the weight of the pumice lapilli deposit as triggering mechanism for the wall collapse in room 22: 1) no evidence of roof collapse has been found on the ground or embedded in the pyroclastic sequence; 2) pumice lapilli penetrated through the openings; 3) the room is bounded to east by the alley and to west by an open space (courtyard) suggesting the presence of a sloping roof (or a canopy towards the courtyard) that drained most of pumice lapilli. After the end of the Plinian phase, a series of pyroclastic currents invaded Pompeii. Among these, the EU4pf parental current is regarded to have triggered building collapses and wall damage (Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Cioni et al., 1992)(Anon, n.d.)(Cioni et al., 2000)(Anon, n.d.)(Gurioli et al., 2005). As evidenced by (Anon, n.d.), through the evaluation of the destruction pattern in the house of Iulius Polybius (Figure 1), the EU4pf parental current (their unit E) was highly mobile and densitystratified (i.e., particle concentration increases toward the base of the current). The concentrated basal part was channelled, partially deflected by the buildings, while the upper diluted part was unaffected by the obstacles moving undisturbed above the buildings (Gurioli et al., 2005)(Anon, n.d.). (Anon, n.d.) suggested that the orientation of the walls with respect to the flow direction appears to be a fundamental parameter for the assessment of the damage, as also reported by (Anon, n.d.) by modelling the building vulnerability to pyroclastic currents. Walls parallel (NW-SE oriented) to the current direction were minimally or not damaged, while walls perpendicular (NE-SW oriented) to the current direction suffered severe damage being toppled or knocked down, resting on a few centimeters of ash emplaced by the pyroclastic current. A similar conclusion is provided by (Varone & Marturano, 1997) and (Marturano & Varone, 2005) interpreting a large collapsed wall in the south-western sector of the house of the Painters at Work (Figure 10B). Where successive walls (two or more) are closely spaced, the depth and the amount of the damage appears lower downcurrent (Anon, n.d.). Dynamically, these observations suggest that repeated and closely spaced wallpyroclastic current interactions forced particles to settle from the depositional system, with a consequent loss of mass resulting, in turn, in a decrease of kinetic energy. These characteristics are fully consistent with those of the damaged wall in room 22 whose demolition was reliably the result of the impact of the EU4pf parental current. In detail, the evidence of a pyroclastic currentinduced failure is: 1) The wall happens to be perpendicular to the flow direction; 2) the wall collapsed south-eastward (in the direction of the flow) resulting in toppling; 3) the north-western wall shows a channel-shaped breach; 4) the wall fragments rest on a few centimetres of ash emplaced by the EU4pf parental current. Nevertheless, we report that not all the scientific community agrees that Pompeii suffered the destructive effects of the pyroclastic currents. (Dellino et al., 2020) modelled the impact of the EU4pf parental current on buildings and humans at Pompeii through the estimation of flow physical parameters, among which the dynamic pressure. According to these authors, the EU4pf flow dynamic pressure had a maximum in the first few decimeters and decreased higher in the current to values lower than 1 kPa, suggesting that Examples of damage caused by primary volcanic phenomena in the Insula dei Casti Amanti (IX.12): (A) collapsed roof, unearthed during a recent (2023) excavation in the \"Casa del Cenacolo Colonnato II\", resulting from a vertical load, found embedded in the pumice lapilli fall deposit; (B) wall pulled down (south-eastward) in the south-western sector of the house of the Painters at Work (close to the west alley); this finding dates to the mid-1990s. Literature sources (Varone & Marturano, 1997)(Anon, n.d.)(Marturano & Varone, 2005) attribute the wall failure to the dynamic pressure exerted by the EU4pf parental current. This wall lies at the same stratigraphic height and shares the same attitude and orientation as the toppled wall found in room 22 of the same house. Inset: detail of the 79 CE stratigraphy underlying the wall. no severe mechanical damage to walls should be expected with such a flow strength. The model is based on laboratory analyses on samples extracted from the deposit and a field survey carried out in the house of Stabianus (Figure 1), in the south-eastern part of Pompeii, where human corpses as well as tiles and wooden poles (Luongo et al., 2003)(Scandone et al., 2019)(Giacomelli et al., 2011) have been embedded in the EU4pf ash deposit, with no details about the relationship between the structure (and the characteristics of the structural damage) and the 79 CE stratigraphy that, in our opinion, is an aspect as decisive as the estimation of the flow dynamic pressure when assessing the damage. Views that differ from that of (Dellino et al., 2020) are provided by other authors (Nunziante et al., 2003)(Ruggieri et al., 2020)(Anon, n.d.) through different estimations of the flow dynamic pressure. Based on the stratigraphic survey and structural analysis of a Roman villa at Terzigno (5 km E-SE of Vesuvius; Figure 1), (Nunziante et al., 2003) suggested that values of dynamic pressure up to 5 kPa (range 1-5 kPa) were sufficient to cause the failure of masonry buildings. (Anon, n.d.) suggested that the presence in Pompeii of decimeter-sized building fragments locally incorporated in the EU4pf ash deposit, as reported by (Gurioli et al., 2007), and possibly entrained and transported by the pyroclastic current, is evidence of dynamic pressures up to 5-10 kPa. Finally, (Ruggieri et al., 2020) estimated dynamic pressures up to 30 kPa through the analysis of the damage to the northern Pompeii city walls, near the Tower XI (Figure 1) also referred to as Torre di Mercurio (Mercury's Tower). In this site, these authors detected the sliding of large blocks, on both the inner and outer leaves of the city walls, that they attributed to the impact of a pyroclastic current (likely the EU4pf parental current). In addition, other aspects should be considered as they affect the strength of the buildings and, therefore, the response to external forces: 1) the construction technique and the quality of masonry structures (e.g., (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Autiero et al., 2020)) and 2) the potential structural preconditioning caused by pre-or syneruptive seismicity that would reduce the resistance of the buildings and increase their vulnerability (e.g., (Anon, n.d.), possibly resulting in structural collapses triggered even by relatively low values of dynamic pressure. Given these discrepancies concerning the dynamic pressure values and limit behaviour of the ancient Roman masonry, we rely our interpretation on the characteristics, attitude, and stratigraphic height of the damage, engulfed in the 79 CE pyroclastic sequence, that match those reported in the available field-based studies in Pompeii. Nonetheless, we have attempted a rough estimate of the flow dynamic pressure, which possibly triggered the wall collapse in room 22, by combining geometrical parameters of the wall, measured in the field, and mechanical parameters of Roman masonry structures derived from literature. (Nunziante et al., 2003) provided a correlation between the limit tensile strength of Roman masonry walls, having thickness in the range 40-60 cm, and values of dynamic pressure that make the walls unstable and prone to collapse. By means of experimental tests, the authors estimated values of tensile strength in the order of 10 2 kPa. Assuming an average tensile strength of 1.5×10 2 kPa (Nunziante et al., 2003), a wall thickness (45 cm) in the range 40-60 cm, and considering the reduction of the wall surface exposed to the passage of the pyroclastic current (due to the partial burying in the pumice lapilli deposit during the Plinian phase), a flow dynamic pressure of 3-4 kPa is roughly estimated. For the sake of clarity, we stress that our interpretation of the collapsed wall in room 22 is based on observations and data collected in a limited area with respect to the areal extent of Pompeii. The same applies to the literature studies concerning the impact of the EU4pf parental current, based on both the modelling of the pyroclastic current behaviour and fieldbased analysis of the relationship between the pyroclastic deposits and damage. This implies that the results do not necessarily represent the physical behaviour of the pyroclastic current at the scale of the city, which may vary in space due to the disturbance caused by the urban environment (Gurioli et al., 2005)(Anon, n.d.). Regarding the main collapse unit in room A, based on the stratigraphic data, we can clearly rule out a contribution of the EU4pf parental current to the wall failures. However, we provide other evidence to further constrain our conclusion: 1) the PW1, striking approximately NW-SE, happens to be parallel to the general flow direction, 2) the north-western perimeter wall (shared with the room 22, Figure 3), oriented approximately NE-SW (perpendicular to the flow direction), does not show any type of damage likely due to the protection of the adjoining room 22 to the north, 3) the large masonry fragment, behaving as a monolithic block, was horizontally displaced towards the north-east and then slipped down implying a hypothetical flow dynamic pressure coming from the south-west, 4) the wall was originally confined to the west by a pumice lapilli deposit, which filled most of the western sector (Figure 9), that protected the wall itself from the impact of the pyroclastic current; 5) no overturning or toppling occurred as a consequence of the dynamic solicitation. Ultimately, no cause-effect relationship can be invoked between the EU4pf parental current and the collapse unit in room A. After ruling out primary volcanic phenomena as the cause of the wall failures in room A, we can look for other possible damaging events like the effects of structural decay due to aging and gravity (e.g., (Marco, 2008)(Galadini, 2009). As the collapse units in room A have been engulfed primary volcanic deposits during a geologically instantaneous event (volcanic eruption) that has frozen the exact moment of the destruction, the contribution of aging or gravity for the structural decay, as well as the action of roots and soil flow, cannot be invoked. We can also exclude the contribution of spoliation or exploratory tunnels as they usually appear as roughly circular breaches through the walls filled with anthropically reworked material. Damage to archaeological structures caused by transient seismic shakings, defined as Earthquake Archaeological Effects (EAEs, (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) or Potential Earthquake Archaeological Effects (PEAEs, (Jusseret et al., 2013) are diverse, ranging from penetrative fractures to rotated, displaced or collapsed masonry blocks, walls or columns. Seismic destruction usually involves the rapid collapse of large wall fragments, locally associated with accumulations of coarse debris having maximum thickness close to the collapsed wall (e.g., (Galadini, 2009). Lateral failure and displacement along a horizontal plane and subsequent collapse of unreinforced masonry walls, whose capability to accommodate the deformation is low (Anon, 1998)(Fonti, 2016), require horizontal forces that are consistent with earthquake motion (Anon, 1998)(Marco, 2008)(Anon, n.d.). This is the described case of room A, where the PW1 was characterized by a sub-horizontal shear plane above which the large masonry fragment experienced a monolithic behaviour, being displaced (Figure 4; Figure 8A) and then slipped down. The shear plane and displacement likely occurred along the weakest mortar joints through the stone blocks of the opus incertum as demonstrated by (Autiero et al., 2020) through experimental tests on reproduced full-scale masonry panels complying with this building technique. This type of failure is also referred to as \"out-of-plane\" because it results from a load operating perpendicular to the wall surface as opposed to the \"in-plane\" load acting parallel to the wall surface and, usually, resulting in diagonal cracking (e.g., (Anon, 1998)(Vanin et al., 2020). Furthermore, as usually observed after modern earthquakes which damaged historical buildings, the collapse of the large masonry fragment was accompanied by the break-up of the adjacent parts of the wall, forming accumulations of debris composed of stones within a matrix of mortar and plaster fragments, giving a picture which has already been sketched as consistent with archaeoseismological evidence (e.g., (Galadini, 2009). The seismic hypothesis is also supported by volcanological data that chronologically place the occurrence of the wall failures in room A at the beginning of caldera-forming phase of the eruption, which was accompanied by intense seismicity (see the paragraph about the syn-eruptive seismicity). Furthermore, other evidence suggests the occurrence of shakings also during the Plinian phase. Indeed, the presence of a number of plaster fragments interspersed in the grey pumice lapilli heap, detached from the surrounding walls, may be consistent with low-amplitude volcanic tremors. Similarly, (Anon, n.d.)(Cioni et al., 2000) reported pieces of mortar lying directly on the ground at Villa dei Papiri, Herculaneum (∼7 km south-west of Vesuvius; Figure 1), resulting from precursory or syn-eruptive (Plinian phase) shakings. Regarding the toppled wall in room 22, our data point to a structural failure triggered by the EU4pf parental current. However, the hypothetical contribution of an earthquake-induced (both pre-or syn-eruptive) structural preconditioning cannot be completely excluded, even though it cannot be traced. The Pompeian geoarchaeological stratigraphy often records only the last or the most significant damaging event of a sequence. This means that it might not be possible to trace an early earthquake-induced weakening of a masonry structure (e.g., small fractures with no displacement can form) because the effects of the subsequent damaging event (pyroclastic current) can completely obliterate the (minor) seismic damage, recording only the effects of the last event as in the described case in room 22. The whole picture can also benefit from taking into account the local geological characteristics possibly conditioning the site effects (e.g., (Amato et al., 2022)(Hinojosa, 2023). From a lithostratigraphic perspective, the ancient Pompeii was built on a small hill serving as lithoid substrate, made up of lavas and welded pyroclastic deposits, covered by loose to compacted sediments consisting of pyroclastic deposits (thin layers of ash and lapilli resulting from pre-79 CE eruptions), buried soils, reworked volcaniclastic deposits and anthropogenic cuts and infills, sealed by the 79 CE eruption (Altunel et al., 2009)(Amato et al., 2022). From a geomorphological perspective, the surface of the lithoid substrate is characterized by different landforms as small crater rims, isolated peaks, elongated ridges, and relatively flat areas. This uneven superficial morphology of the lithoid substrate involves a variable thickness of the cover terrains, from absent to a few meters (Altunel et al., 2009)(Amato et al., 2022). By merging these geological and geomorphological factors, along with geophysical data (seismic tomography), (Amato et al., 2022) proposed a seismic microzonation of the entire Pompeii archaeological site. Regarding the Insula dei Casti Amanti, subsoil profiles along the alleys, drawn through borehole data, suggest the presence of a small morphological depression (lithoid substrate) in which the pre-79 CE sequence of cover terrains thickens, attaining a total thickness of at least 4-5 m (Patti, 2003)(Sanctis et al., 2019)(Anon, n.d.)(Amato et al., 2022). Such characteristics, according to the investigation by (Amato et al., 2022), make the area of the Insula dei Casti Amanti prone to site effects, possibly associated with Vp and Vs wave velocity between 300 and 600 m/s. The possibility that the local amplification of seismic motion contributed to the observed damage will be investigated in detail during a future-planned campaign of ambient vibration measurements. Causes of death in Pompeii during the 79 CE eruption are being debated since long time. Great attention has been given to the modes of death caused by the arrival of the pyroclastic currents and referred to as lethal thermal effects due to heat, asphyxiation due to inhalation of fine ash particles or, very rarely, mechanical impact (Baxter, 1990)(Luongo et al., 2003)(Ghedini et al., 2003)(Mastrolorenzo et al., 2010)(Dellino et al., 2020)(Mastrolorenzo et al., 2021)(Alapont et al., 2023). In addition, the duration of the pyroclastic current, and consequently the exposure time to an ash-rich environment, has been identified as a life-threatening factor contributing to asphyxia (Dellino et al., 2020). Conversely, much less attention has been given to the human remains of individuals who perished during the Plinian phase of the eruption. They are generally regarded as victims of the collapse of the roofs resulting from the overload of the pumice lapilli deposit, if found inside buildings, or killed by the crumbling roof tiles or by large lithic fragments falling from the eruptive column or emplaced as ballistics, if found outdoors (Luongo et al., 2003)(Ghedini et al., 2003). Moreover, (Zanella et al., 2007), based on thermal remanent magnetization data, suggested that the pumice fall deposit was emplaced hot enough to heat up cold material to 120-140 °C, speculating that it would have been able to cause skin burn and carbonization of wood. (Luongo et al., 2003) reject this hypothesis suggesting that the Plinian phase resulted in a cold deposit. The direct stratigraphic relationship between the two skeletons and the large collapsed masonry fragments (Figure 5) suggests that the death of both individuals is concurrent with the wall failures, whose timing during the eruption has been volcanologically wellconstrained. This information allows us to rule out any lethal effect associated with the pyroclastic current phase as cause of death. Their stratigraphic position above the grey pumice lapilli suggests that they were still alive by the end of the Plinian phase, allowing the exclusion of any hypothetical thermal effect of the lapilli deposit. Moreover, taking into account that the grey pumice lapilli progressively penetrated the room through the window facing the eastern alley, the lack of charred wood fragments suggests that the resulting deposit was nearly cold (only the faint trace of a rotted object has been observed above the individual 2's skeletal remains). The perimortal traumatic pattern of fractures (thoracic cage, pelvis, skull, limbs) is consistent with extremely severe compression traumas, likely having fatal consequences, caused by the collapse of the partition walls which was triggered, as previously discussed, by a seismic solicitation. For the individual 2, a contribution of asphyxia in a confined space cannot be totally excluded. It is worth noting that such traumas are analogous to those of individuals involved in modern earthquakes (e.g., (Naghi et al., 2005)(Dong et al., 2010)(Anon, n.d.) providing a further constrain to our interpretation pointing to the contribution of the seismic destruction. Our conclusions suggest that the effects of the collapse of buildings triggered by syn-eruptive seismicity should be regarded as an additional cause of death in the ancient Pompeii other than those reported in literature. In this light, in a broader view that takes into account the whole city, we consider, as a working hypothesis, that the casualties caused by seismically triggered building failures may not be limited to the two individuals described in this study. According to literature sources (Luongo et al., 2003)(Ghedini et al., 2003)(Scandone et al., 2019), a total of 394 bodies were recovered in the pumice lapilli deposit resulting from the Plinian phase. Of these, 345 were found inside the houses and are thought to have been killed by roof collapses resulting from the weight of the lapilli deposit (Luongo et al., 2003)(Ghedini et al., 2003). We hypothesize that a number of roofs, which were able to withstand the accumulation of pumice lapilli, may have crumbled shortly after the end of the Plinian phase as a consequence of the strong earthquakes that accompanied the caldera formation. This hypothesis would imply that a number of people who survived to the Plinian phase, and did not attempt to flee their houses after the cessation of the lapilli fallout, may have been overwhelmed by earthquake-induced collapses of roofs loaded by pumice lapilli. The same applies to the roof collapses and deaths that occurred during the Plinian phase. Some of them may have been triggered by earthquakes occurred during the night between the first and second day of the eruption and reported by Pliny the Younger. During modern archaeological excavations, the systematic attribution of the roof failures to the overload of the pumice lapilli possibly resulted in a misinterpretation of the actual triggering mechanism of some of them. The syneruptive seismicity probably also played a role in the choices made by the victims of the second phase of the eruption as inferred from their areal distribution (indoor vs. outdoor areas). A total of 650 bodies were recovered in the pyroclastic current deposits (Luongo et al., 2003)(Ghedini et al., 2003)(Scandone et al., 2019); the vast majority were in the EU4pf ash deposits (Luongo et al., 2003) while a few victims have been associated with the EU3pftot unit (e.g., (Anon, n.d.)(Marturano & Varone, 2005). The victims of the pyroclastic current phase are almost equally distributed between indoor (334) and outdoor (316) areas (Luongo et al., 2003)(Ghedini et al., 2003)(Scandone et al., 2019). According to (Scarpati et al., 2020), the surviving inhabitants were encouraged to leave their houses or shelters by brief breaks in the succession of volcanic events at Pompeii, represented by stratigraphic hiatuses in the 79 CE pyroclastic sequence consisting of erosion surfaces filled with reworked sediments. Such brief breaks preceded and followed the emplacement of the EU4bl fall layer (their unit D), resulting from a short-lived (about half an hour) eruption column (Scarpati et al., 2020)(Ceccaroni et al., 2009), which anticipated the most devastating and lethal pyroclastic current. It has also been speculated that some survivors who had left their houses at the first signs of unrest, or during the initial phase of the eruption, attempted to return, likely to recover their possessions, by taking advantage of the temporary decline of the volcanic phenomena (e.g., (Lirer et al., 1993). However, the evidence of severe, syneruptive (caldera collapse phase) seismic damage, provided in this study, suggests that the significant seismicity possibly contributed to push some survivors, still in Pompeii, to flee their refuges (and discouraging the return of most of those who had left), seeking safety outside, then being caught by the arrival of the EU4pf pyroclastic current along roads/alleys and in open spaces, as already speculated by (Scandone et al., 2019). frontiersin.org Sparice et al. 10.3389/feart.2024.1386960 Modern volcanology has greatly benefitted from studies concerning the destructive effects of the 79 CE Plinian eruption in Pompeii. This study provides new observations and data on underrated/neglected effects of the eruption through different investigative approaches. Our results represent a starting point for an updated view of the destruction of Pompeii, by considering the syn-eruptive seismicity as a contributing cause of building collapse and death of the inhabitants, and open new perspectives of research, e.g., the interplay between volcanic and seismic processes during the 79 CE eruption, the investigation of ancient seismic effects in volcanic areas, and paleopathological studies on individuals who suffered the consequence of building collapses. Previous studies in Pompeii have shed light on of how volcanic phenomena interacted with buildings but new information can be gained. The available data indicate that the effects of the seismicity related to the 79 CE eruption cannot be neglected and that a volcanic eruption may imply damaging effects even in absence of destruction directly related to primary volcanic phenomena. The recognition of the effects of any volcanic/seismic event and the spatial distribution of the associated damage can lead to a cumulative map of destruction layers and related timing during the 79 CE eruption. The response and resistance of buildings to seismic actions is fundamental to assess the damage, particularly when combined with vertical loads due to tephra accumulation and dynamic pressure owing to lateral flow processes (Baxter et al., 2005)(Anon, n.d.). Therefore, our next initiatives related to other excavation sites in Pompeii, where evidence consistent with past seismicity is being uncovered, will also involve widespread analysis of site effects, modelling of the dynamic solicitation and structural response of the ancient buildings bearing traces of damage/destruction, in addition to detailed stratigraphic reconstructions. This can also have implications for the mitigation of seismic vulnerability of the archaeological structures in Pompeii (Fonti, 2016)(Calvanese et al., 2021)(Satta et al., 2021). In this light, a glance to the Seismic Hazard Map of Italy (Anon, 2004) seems opportune. The Vesuvius and Pompeii area, along with other peri-Tyrrhenian volcanic areas of peninsular Italy, is included in the Zone 2 that comprises territories that may be affected by quite strong earthquakes. Based on a seismic source zone model, that in the investigated area is derived from the regional historical seismicity (Anon, 2008), the hazard map and the related classification clearly claim for building techniques and interventions that should prevent seismic damage comparable to that associated with the syneruptive seismicity. Therefore, the described archaeoseismological case in the Insula dei Casti Amanti, in Pompeii, provides further evidence of the seismic characteristics summarized in the Hazard Map and represents a new incentive to keep attention focused on the importance of the defence against earthquakes in the Vesuvius volcanic area. The death of two individuals, caused by seismically triggered wall failures, has implications for a lesser-known branch of paleopathological studies of victims of ancient earthquakes, for which very few cases exist in Italy (e.g., (Galadini et al., 2010). Also in this case, the multidisciplinary approach is a fundamental tool. The traumatic pattern of bone fractures alone, resulting from compression traumas associated with building collapses, is not indicative of a specific triggering mechanism of the collapse (e.g., (Giacomelli et al., 2011). The recognition of multiple bone fractures and the evaluation of the severity of the skeletal crush injuries, compatible with compression traumas having fatal consequences, of human and/or animal remains recovered in archaeological areas may provide important clues that, associated with the local geological and archaeoseismological picture, can contribute to the assessment of the collapse dynamics possibly pointing to the seismic destruction triggered by past and poorly known earthquakes. The comparison of the traumatic pattern with that showed by casualties (or survivors showing severe traumas) of modern earthquakes can further constrain the seismic hypothesis. Finally, our work emphasizes that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary, even decisive, in the assessment of the damage and the cause-effect relationship during future excavations in Pompeii. This is a challenging task, due to the interplay between volcanic and seismic phenomena, that can be achieved through a synergistic work between archaeologists and earth scientists (and anthropologists and/or archaeozoologists if human/animal remains are recovered), devoid of any preconceived archaeological and/or volcanological scheme in the wake of what has been done in this work.

    "abstract": "The archaeological site of Pompeii is surely one of the best known areas of Roman world, and many mosaic fountains were found in some elegant houses. Generally, it seemed that mosaic fountains which lay out in the gardens of the houses, shows one of the decorations, but the investigation for the mosaic fountains by archaeologists gave us many possibilities to known many aspects of daily Roman life. For example, the mosaic fountains had two functions: they were not only the decoration of gardens but also little sacellum, namely a shrine with a religious function. Therefore, splendid and brilliant mosaic fountains were produced using shining effect as a sacellum by the Roman craftsmen. On the contrary, it is also important issue to know the geometrical features of mosaic fountains which give valuable information for studying culture in those days such as sculptural technique, art, aesthetic sense and so on. In order to understand religious meaning and structural features of the mosaic fountains, 3D modelling and visualization is an efficient method. However, the most difficult issue for the archaeologists in an archaeological project is surly the graphic campaign, acquisition of geometrical information such as size, length and shape for the archaeological objects. In these circumstances, collaboration among the professional of different disciplines is absolutely necessary, and in order to realize these relationship, archaeological and photogrammetric investigations for the mosaic fountain in Pompeii were performed in cooperation with archaeologist and photogrammetrist.",
    "full_text": "The archaeological site of Pompeii is surely one of the best known areas of Roman world, and many mosaic fountains were found in some elegant houses. Some years ago, we have begun a project about mosaic fountains in Pompeii (Anon, n.d.) with following parts: 1) Ancient bibliography; 2) Research of ancient photos; 3) Research of ancient drawings; 4) Photo campaign; 5) Graphic campaign; 6) Final publication of the research. Generally we use very traditional methods to draw, that is to say metre, pencil, eraser and naturally hands. Therefore, the most difficult part of this project is surly the graphic campaign, because drawing a mosaic fountain has many difficulties. On the contrary, a convenient 3D measurement method using consumer grade digital camera is enormously expected with appearance of the low cost and high-resolution consumer grade digital cameras. Indeed, developing low-cost photogrammetric system have been ranked as one of the important issues during last decade in the ISPRS WG regarding Cultural Heritage; WG V/5 (World Cultural Heritage) for 1996-2000, WG V/4 (Image Analysis and Spatial Information Systems for Applications in Cultural Heritage) for 2000-2004, WG V/2 (Cultural Heritage Documentation) for (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Furthermore, establishing cooperative relations with related disciplines is also the important issue in the ISPRS WG regarding Cultural Heritage and cooperation is indispensable in archaeological investigations. In these circumstances, archaeological and photogrammetric investigations were performed in cooperation with archaeologist and photogrammetrist in this paper. Pompeii is the best site to study the mosaic fountains because there are about twenty mosaic fountains. The archaeological research in Pompeii gives us many opportunities for the knowledge of Roman world and the study of ancient mosaic fountains in this town also gives us many opportunities to know water technology and handicrafts of a typical Roman town in the first century A.D. The ancient Greeks and Romans used mosaics for floor but in some case we can see mosaics on the walls. The first mosaics in Italy are in South Italy and they belong to III or II century B.C. and they were made by little stone; ancient Greeks called them lithostroda. The tesserae of first mosaics were black and white but, generally from the I century B.C., they were coloured (Anon, 1938). For mosaic tesserae, Greek and Roman craftsmen used stones but from the first century B.C., they began to use glass tesserae. An other important aspect of Greek and Roman mosaics is the size of tesserae. Generally from the I century B.C. until the I century A.D. The mosaic tesserae are very little because in this period Greek and Roman craftsman were specialized to cut stones. Usually the archaeologists call mosaic fountains, nimphaei, because Nimphae were divinities of rivers, lakes, springs, that is to say water. The importance of water in the mosaic fountain is testified by many factors. The first factor is the colour. In fact tree colours are often present in the mosaic fountain, the azure, the blue and the green and they are colours which remind us to the rivers, the sea, etc.. The reference to water is testified also by the divinities, animals and plants portrayed on mosaic fountains. In fact many time on mosaic fountains some divinities are portrayed like Neptunus, the king of the rivers, lakes, sea etc. Oceanus, Nereides, Venus with Cupidus, her little son, etc. Among the animals, we must remember gees, ducks, swans, dolphins, fishes and among the plants, the reeds. Another reference to the sea is the presence of many kinds of shells; generally they are put on the limits of mosaic fountains and they have the function of a frame; in other cases, the shells delimit a space for a decoration. Usually in the Roman houses the mosaic fountains were in the gardens, in the open air, in contact with the sky, so the azure tesserae remind to the sky. So we have written, Venus was portrayed in mosaic fountains, but we must remember another aspect of this divinity; in fact Venus was also the divinity of the gardens and in Athens there was a sacred area, Oi Kepoi, that is to say \"The Gardens\", where Aphrodites, the Greek Venus, was venerated like Aphrodites en tois Kepois, that is to say \"Aphrodites in the Gardens\". So we can say, the mosaic fountains had two function: aesthetic function and religious function. \"House of Big Fountain\" (Figure 1) lies near the Forum, the most important square in a Roman town, in the North-West area of ancient Pompeii. It is a good example of mosaic fountain in the Roman Age (La Rocca -de Vos -de Vos, 1994). The first phase of the \"House of the Big Fountain\" was built during Republican Roman Age; in fact the façade is built, in opus quadratum, by large stones. This house was subsequently transformed and in the last phase, a beautiful mosaic fountain was built in the west side of the garden (Figure 2). The place of the fountain wasn't accidental, but it was well considered. In fact the fountain is in the garden, leant against the west closing wall of the garden; in that position, all the guests of the owner of the house could see it when they arrived. Fgure 2. Mosaic Fountain The archaeologist divide the mosaic fountains in many categories and this mosaic fountain belongs to aedicula, a Latin word meaning \"little temple\", because its shape is like a little Greek temple. So we have written, this fountain is a good example of mosaic fountain of Roman Age; in fact it has many characteristic of the mosaic fountains. Figure 5. Oceanus The first characteristic is the glass coloured tesserae and in this fountain we can admire \"the triumph of the colours\" (Figure 3). Admiring this fountain, we can notice that the azure and the green are the predominant colours (Figure 34). The religious aspect of this fountain is testified by the presence of Oceanus (Figure 5). This divinity, not causally, is portrayed above a little rectangular covered lead space from where the water came out; so Oceanus gave kindly the water, symbol of life and joy. Let's notice that the colour of the tesserae in the background is the blue. On the upper part of the fountain, we can admire two very elegant white swans (Figure 4); the birds are portrayed while they soar in the blue sky. Their position on the fountain is symmetric because the symmetry was a very important role in Greek and Roman architecture and decoration. The presence of the swans in this decoration is very important because in the second-half of I century A. D., when probably the fountain was built, the swans are portrayed also in the painting and in the paintings of ancient Pompeii, we have many examples. Not only swans are portrayed in this fountain but also the gees (Figure 6). The gees are portrayed lower, almost in the central zone of the fountain. They don't swim, may be we expect, but they are on their paws; but the bleu colour of the tesserae, in the background, remind us to water. So we have written, the shells are another very important factor for Roman mosaic fountain. This fountain has two kind of shells, the first is on the middle and on the upper part of the fountain (Figures 34567) and the second in on the low part (Figure 8). The second kind of shell, the murex, was very important in the Roman Age, because, like the Phoenicians, the Romans used the murex to make the purple, a very expansive product that the Romans used to have the famous \"purple red\". The shells of murex form a line and upper there is a beautiful decoration with glass blue tesserae. When this fountain was excavated, the archaeologists found in the basin a little bronze statue representing Cupidus, with a dolphin; nowadays this statue is in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. We aren't amazed because Cupidus is Venus's son and Venus is one of the most important divinities representing on the mosaic fountains. This fountain is surely very elegant because not only mosaic tesserae decorate it, but in the low part, there are some marble slabs, a marble the basin, a little marble staircase and two marble mask for tragedy (Figure 9). We can understand the presence of this mask if we remember the masterpieces of ancient Roman writers, like Petronius. This writer describes the dinners of the ancient Romans and so we know during the dinner they could watch a theatrical performances. Probably the owner of the \"House of Big Fountain\" had a dinner in the garden, in the open space, so the Romans loved and he watch a theatrical performances. Finally, the last characteristic of this fountain is the presence of pumice stone in the low part (Figure 8). The pumice stone was used for decoration from the I century B.C. until the first years of II century A.D.. The Romans used pumice stone to make an impression of a cavern where often there was a spring. A convenient 3D measurement method using consumer grade digital camera is enormously expected in various application fields with appearance of the low cost and high-resolution Figure 6. Gees & Blue Tesserates Figure 8. Shell on the Low Part of the Fountain (a) Left Mask (b) Right Mask Figure 9. Two marble mask on the Fountain consumer grade digital cameras, and there are many software for digital photogrammetry on the market in Japan. In these circumstances, many performance evaluations for consumer grade digital cameras have been investigated from the view point of digital Photogrammetry (Fraser, 1997)(Kunii & Chikatsu, 2001)(Noma et al., 2002)(Habib & M, 2003), and it has been concluded that consumer grade digital cameras are expected to become useful tool for convenient digital photogrammetry (Kunii & Chikatsu, 2001)). Furthermore,\"3DiVision\" under the key words; 3Dimension, Digital image and Visualization has been designed to perform convenient 3D measurement using consumer grade digital cameras (Anon, 2002). However, there are some issues for practical 3D measurements in many photogrammetric software including 3DiVision. One is surveying of Ground Control Points (GCPs) for camera calibration, and the other is interior orientation procedure which is implemented beforehand using test sheet or test target. Theses restrict conditions should be removed in ubiquitous digital photogrammetry using consumer grade digital cameras. In order to remove these restrict conditions and to promote a convenient digital photogrammetry using consumer grade digital camera, 3DiVision was improved using triplet images. Figure 10 shows the concept of the improved 3Division (Ver.2), and it was concluded that 3DiVision Ver.2 is expected to contribute the various close range application fields since interior and exterior orientation parameters are calibrated simultaneously without any GCPs on object space (Anon, n.d.). Furthermore, the most difficult part on the project regarding the fountains in Pompei was the graphic campaign, namely drawing the mosaic fountains, and it was realized that collaboration among the professional of different disciplines is absolutely necessary. In these circumstances, archaeological and photogrammetric investigations for the mosaic fountain and sculptures in Pompeii were performed in cooperation with archaeologist and photogrammetrist using 3DiVision Ver.2. In order to investigate the mosaic fountains and statues using 3DiVision Ver.2, triplet images for the mosaic fountain and complex high relief sculptures were taken respectively. The mosaic fountain (Figure 2) lay out in the garden of the House of the Big Fountain. This house lies near the Forum, the most important square in a Roman town, in the North-West area of ancient Pompeii. Figure 11 shows ortho image and Figure 12 shows contour map with 5cm interval. On the contrary, Figure 13 shows range images, and Figure 14,15 shows horizontal and vertical cross sections for the place where are shown in each figure. Figure 14.

Vertical Cross Section Figure 16 shows horizontal cross section for A3-A3', and range images with a perfect circle 1.5ｍ in diameter restrictively. It can be seen from the horizontal cross section for Figure 16 (a), (b) that the fountain was produced cylindrically with perfect circle. Therefore, it can be said from this point that the Roman craftsmen were expert on sculptural technique. On the contrary, nevertheless it seems that the roof parts shows roundly (for example Figure 3.), the roof part of the fountain shows linearity, doesn't show circle (Figure 16 (c)). From these results, it may be said that 3 dimensional illusionism was already fashionable among the Roman craftsmen. Recently, 3 dimentional visualization has been receiving more attention as a useful method to understand engineering phenomenon intuitively, or to find out important elements that we can't detect in usual simulation. Furthermore, visualization under virtual environment is efficient method from a view point that people can appreciate or experience the archaeological objects or historical space through the computer. With this motive, 3D animation for the mosaic fountain and sculptures were performed. Figure 17 shows triplet images and TIN models for the high relief sculptures which decollate the fountain. TIN model were generated after camera calibration, and 3D texture modelling were performed using texture which were taken by consumer grade digital cameras. Figure 16. Geometrical Features (c) Vertical Range Image (b) Horizontal Range Image 7cm 7cm (a) Cross Section for A3-A3' 3 dimentional visualization is efficient method to understand the culture in those days intuitively. However, the most difficult issue for the archaeologists in an archaeological project is surly the graphic campaign, acquisition of geometrical information such as size, length and shape for the archaeological objects. On the contrary, a convenient 3D measurement method using consumer grade digital camera is enormously expected with appearance of the low cost and high-resolution amateur digital cameras. In these circumstances, archaeological and photogrammetric investigations for the mosaic fountain in Pompeii were performed in cooperation with archaeologist and photogrammetrist. As the results, it can be concluded that the mosaic fountains in Romen period were not only decoration of the gardens but also little sacellum from the view point of archaeological investigation. Similarly, it can be said that Roman craftsmen had high level skill in producing fountain, and 3 dimensional illusionism was already fashionable among the Roman craftsmen from the view point of geometric investigation using photogrammetric software 3DiVision. Furthermore, it is verified that all the details of mosaic fountain and the colours of tesserae which were obtained by digital photogrammetry using 3Division aren't altered. Consequently, it is concluded that collaboration among the professional of different disciplines is absolutely necessary, and the 3DiVision Ver.2 is expected to become useful software in the various photogrammetric application fields using consumer grade digital cameras. There is issue, however, for further work. This problem is development more simple and easy photogrammetric software, or more improvement of 3Division Ver.2 so that everyone can use in any situation without special technique.",

    "full_text": "The eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD caused extensive destructions all over the Campanian area, engulfing the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplonti and Stabiae. The eruption followed a long quiescence period and the inhabitants of the area were surprised by the volcanic events. The first part of the eruption was characterized by a widespread dispersal of pumices from a high eruptive column. The second part of the eruption, characterized by pyroclastic flows emplacement, caused the major damages with extensive life losses in most of the towns surrounding the volcano. In Pompeii, the major casualties during the first phase resulted from roof collapses; during the second phase, people were killed either by physical trauma due to the kinetic energy of the flow or by suffucation because of the ash-rich atmosphere. Vesuvius is one of the most studied volcanoes in the world, because of its long time interval with historic eruptions (2000 years), its easy accessibility, and the first well-documented historic explosive eruption: that of 79 AD. The eruption destroyed Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplonti and Stabiae and caused the death of Pliny the Elder among many other people. Before the eruption, earthquakes occurred for some time, but were disregarded by local inhabitants because of their familiarity with the phenomenon. As the younger Pliny testified, \"for several days before (the eruption) the earth had been shaken, but this fact did not cause fear because this was a feature commonly observed in Campania\". The effects of these earthquakes are still visible in several buildings in Pompeii, and Villa Regina, where hastened repair works were underway in the days immediately preceeding the eruption. The main phases of the eruption have been described by Pliny the Younger, who observed the eruption from a distance of more than 25 km, basing also on contemporary testimonies and closer view accounts, especially for what regards the death of the uncle, Pliny the Elder, gone to the rescue of the inhabitants of the area. The beginning of the eruption is uncertain: the two Plinys observed the cloud at the seventh hour of the day (1 PM). We must presume that the eruption began sometime earlier to allow the arrival, at about the same hour, of a messenger sent from the Vesuvian area. The eruptive cloud was directly observed from Misenum at a distance of 21 km, so that they could fully appreciate its total extent and behavior. (\"It resembled a pine [Mediterranean pine] more than any other tree. Like a very high tree, the cloud went high and expanded in different branches. I believe, because it was first driven by a sudden gust of air then, with its diminution or because of the weight, the cloud expanded laterally, sometimes white, sometimes dark and stained by the sustained sand and ash\". During the night of the first day of the eruption, and for most of the morning of the next day, the houses of Misenum were shaken by earthquakes that caused much panic. In the morning of the second day of eruption, Pliny the Younger observed the development of pyroclastic flows descending down the flanks of Vesuvius and flowing on the sea. \"From the other side, black and horrible clouds, broken by sinuous shapes of flaming winds, were opening with long tongues of fire … . After a little while descended onto the land, opened the sea, covered Capri and prevented the sight of Misenum …\" The sequence of events described by the Younger Pliny fits well the geologic record of the eruption (Lirer et al., 1973)(Sigurdsson et al., 1985). We can summaryze the temporal evolution of the eruption into major phases which are typical of most large scale explosive eruptions. 1 The first phase, after minor phreatic explosions, is characterized by the development of an high, sustained column where the erupted mixture of juvenile gases and pyroclasts, mixing turbulently with atmospheric air, rises convectively into the stratosphere reaching an estimated maximum height of 32 km. 2 The second phase is characterized by the collapse of the eruptive column with the emplacement of pyroclastic flows and surges which destroyed every settlement within a radius of 10-15 km from the volcano. 3 Collapse of the magma chamber, ingression of water into the feeding system, magma water interaction and final phreato-magmatic activity. 4 Post-eruption remobilization of ashes and pumice by rain water during the following years. The four phases are identified by their typical deposits (Figure 1). • The first phase produced a fall deposits consisting of a lower part of well-sorted white pumice and an upper part of gray pumice dispersed to the southeast of the volcano and traced on land to a distance of more than 70 km (Lirer et al., 1973). • The deposits of the second phase consist of surge deposits made of layers of thin, poorly-sorted ash with cross bedding, and dune structures alternated with pyroclastic flow deposits made by thick and massive layers partly indurated and poorly sorted (Sigurdsson et al., 1985). • Silty sands beds with abundant accretionary lapilli form the deposit of the third phase. In proximal areas a debris flow deposit consisting of angular lava and carbonate blocks supported by an ash matrix with minor pumices is correlated with this phase (Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Sheridan et al., 1981). by Lisetta Giacomelli 1, Annamaria Perrotta 2 , Roberto Scandone 3 , and Claudio Scarpati 2 The eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD and its impact on human environment in Pompeii 1 Gruppo Nazionale di Vulcanologia, Via Nizza 128, 00193 Roma, Italy. 2 Dipartimento di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Largo San Marcellino 10, 80138, Napoli, Italy. 3 Dipartimento di Fisica, Università di Roma Tre, 00146, Roma, Italy. • The deposits of the fourth phase are a succession of lahars made up of a conglomerate composed of coarse pebbles with a matrix composed of small pebbles and coarse sand (Lirer et al., 2001). (Carey & Sigurdsson, 1987) estimated the height of the eruption column during the development of the Plinian phase basing on the isopleth distribution of maximum diameters of pumice and lithic fragments. They estimated that the eruption column rose from an height of 14 km to 26 km during the emission of white pumice and then to 32 km during the emission of grey pumice immediately before the deposition of pyroclastic flows. The estimates of the column heights permitted the evaluation of the corresponding magma discharge rates. Scandone and Giacomelli (2001) used the estimates of (Carey & Sigurdsson, 1987) to evaluate the temporal evolution of the eruption fed by a 7-12 km deep magma chamber. The progressive removal of magma in the course of the eruption caused a slow boiling of magma within the chamber because of decompression. This in turn produced a faster and faster emission rate until the final collapse of the wall surrounding the reservoir. Scandone and (Giacomelli & Scandone, 2001) evaluated the duration of the first phase at approximately 22 hours (several hours longer than previously estimated basing on average effusion rates). During this phase there was a steady increase in magma discharge rate. The second and most destructive phase with the massive emplacement of the major pyroclastic flows and surges lasted only about 5-6 hours. The city of Pompeii was destroyed and many of its inhabitants were killed during the 79 AD eruption. Several authors have reconstructed the succession of products emplaced during the eruption (e.g. (Lirer et al., 1973)(Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Carey & Sigurdsson, 1987) but the stratigraphic framework used here largely follows that of (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) which specifically studied the impact of this eruption on Pompeii. In the following paragraphs we summarise the damage suffered by population and buildings during the first two phases of the eruption and report the stratigraphic height at which were recovered human bodies and crumbled walls. The main sedimentological characteristics of the 79 AD deposit are reported in Figure 2. On the basis of these characteristics the deposit has been subdivided in 8 units named A to H from base upwards; a soil at the top of the sequence (unit I) is also reported. The state of the buildings all over the city is summarised in the following observations: a) the amount of destruction is not the same throughout the city, some buildings were more affected than others; b) the northern (relatively proximal) and southern (relatively distal) sectors in the city were generally affected in the same way; c) the ground floor is partly intact in most of the buildings, whereas the upper floor is almost completely demolished; d) the E-W oriented walls are by far more damaged than those striking N-S; e) in many cases, the northern vent-facing part of the buildings was more damaged than the southern one; f) most of the destruction is stratigraphically related to unit E. As shown in Table 1, 394 corpses were found in the pumice fall deposit and 650 in the pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) deposit. So a total of 1044 victims were recovered inside 2/3 of the city of Pompeii (the excavated part). Other 100 victims are estimated on the basis of many groups of scattered bones. Finally, considering the regions partially excavated (I, III, IV, V, IX) an estimate of 464 corpses still buried is obtained. Furthermore, it is meaningful to document the amount of victims with respect to their location (e.g. inside or outside the buildings). Most of the corpses within the pumice fall deposit were found inside buildings (80% as shown in Table 1), whereas of the 650 corpses recovered in the PDCs deposit 334 were found inside buildings and 316 outdoor (Table 1). (Anon, n.d.), on the basis of recent excavation, state that all human casts in the PDCs deposit lie over the well-recognisable lithic-rich unit D, enclosed within unit E (Figure 2). These corpses are mostly intact and only few corpses are partially or fully dismembered. In the still preserved outcrops of Pompeii and in the photographs of the Pompeii Archive, most of the casts lay prone in the attempt to shelter their face; it is noteworthy that in some places (e.g. garden of fugitives, Regio I, Insula 21; Stabian house, Regio I Insula 22) human casts show the head and the bust supported by arms, with this raised part of the body at higher stratigraphic level within E1. The process of Pompeii's destruction and burial started with the accumulation of a thick pumice lapilli deposit (layers A and B in Figure 1) resulting from the column fallout. The rate of deposition in the city ranged from 15 cm per hour in open areas to 25/30 cm per hour in places accumulating additional pyroclasts rolling from the steeper roofs. Within six hours from the beginning of the eruption the roofs and part of the walls of the buildings had collapsed under the pumice load. By the morning of 25 August most structures were seriously damaged; the pumice fall deposit, generally 3 m thick, totally buried the lower part of the buildings. The percentage of victims (38%) found in this deposit at Pompeii is anomalously high with respect to a mean of 4% of deaths caused by tephra fallout in the last four centuries during explosive eruptions (Anon, 1984)(Tanguy et al., 1999). This high percentage of deaths is possibly due to the attempt of some people to take shelter into buildings where roofs and walls collapsed under the load of the pyroclastic material. The small percentage of people found dead outdoor within the pumice fall deposit was probably killed by the crumbling roof tiles or by the largest lithic fragments following ballistic paths. The first PDC flowed through the city depositing the basal ash layer C and causing irrelevant damages. Based on the evidence that all of the human remains lie above this deposit, it can be deduced that people were not killed by the earlier PDC (units S4 and S5 of (Sigurdsson et al., 1985). The inhabitants survived also to the successive fallout phase that emplaced the lithic-rich layer D and some Table 1 Total of corpses found in the pumice fall deposit and in the stratified ash and pumice PDCs deposit (into buildings and outdoor places) at Pompeii.

In fact, we found the victims several centimetres above the base of this unit. Possibly, the parental pyroclastic current ran over the city with a low-temperature, dilute frontal part settling progressively few centimetres of ash. The rear part of the current had a non-uniform behaviour in terms of concentration, possibly due to the canalization of the basal part of the current along the longitudinal walls of the buildings. Inside these areas the current showed a greater destructive power, flattening most of the (especially transversal) walls, standing out of the pumice fallout deposit, in its north-south path. In the areas outside the channels the current had essentially a depositional behaviour engulfing the city and suffocating the inhabitants. These opposed behaviour of the PDC in very close areas testify to the different kinetic conditions undergone by the Pompeii inhabitants and hence the different physical integrity of their corpses. Observations on objects, cloths, frescoes and skeletons rule out the possibility that burn injuries contributed to kill Pompeii inhabitants, as recently proposed for Herculaneum inhabitants (Anon, n.d.)(Mastrolorenzo et al., 2001). Furthermore, the proposed non-uniform behaviour of PDCs, due to the interaction with the urban structures, justifies the described different state of destruction of the buildings throughout the city. A final phreatomagmatic phase, punctuated by two minor lithic fall episodes, emplaced the upper part of the succession (F to H units). Field features, such as the presence of accretionary lapilli in the upper part of the ash and pumice deposit and the lack of high temperature evidences in the buildings, support the idea of low emplacement temperature for the pyroclastic currents during the final phase of the eruption.",

Suetonius, Claudius 40 So interrupted the emperor Claudius when a heated debate erupted among the Senate regarding the virtues of butchers and barmen before, as Suetonius continued, the emperor \"rambled off into a speech about the abundance of city bars in his youth and how he often used to visit them himself'. Claudius' audience would have found his outburst absurd. The élite perspective on the role of food and drink outlets, or bars, in an urban society was clear: these were retailers in gluttony, and morally reprehensi ble haunts suited only to the lowest strata of society. But to what extent is this image of Roman food and drink outlets reflected in the archaeological remains, and how essential were they to an ancient society? Pompeii, buried by the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, pre serves the greatest collection of bars of the Roman period from which to ask these questions. Scattered about the city are 158 food and drink out lets, recognisable in the archaeological record by their distinctive display and sales counters. The vast majority of these counters were constructed of masonry, a number of which were faced with coloured fragments of re used marble; some wooden counters existed also. These service counters were patently constructed to facilitate the retail sale of food and drink: they were placed at the street front of the property for public display and access; were equipped with storage containers, some of which retained identifiable foodstuffs when excavated; and usually contained an in-built hearth for the heating and cooking of food and drink (fig. 1).",
    "full_text": "This paper will demonstrate the fundamental importance of food and drink outlets to the urban community of Pompeii. There is an imbalance of infor mation concerning the daily consumption of food and drink in the Roman world. The tendency for scholars to focus on the ancient literary record, itself concerned mainly with the dining habits of the patricians, has limit ed our understanding of this element of Roman quotidian life. When attempts have been made to understand the broader social spread of con sumption, scholars have tended to follow the perceptions of the past, choosing to imagine bars solely as places of impiety and limiting their dis cussions, and conclusions, as to where in the city such activities were accepted. A fuller appreciation of the intrinsic value of food and drink out lets is warranted. The available archaeological evidence can demonstrate not only their importance to the everyday operation of the city -social interaction, vocation, accommodation and, of course, the provision of food and drink -but as a consequence the value in examining these types of establishments. Virtue is something elevated, exalted and regal, unconquered and unweary; pleasure is something lowly, servile, weak and unsteady, whose haunt and dw elling-place are the brothel and the bar. You will m eet virtue in the temple, the forum, the Senate house; standing in defence of the city walls, dusty and sunburnt, with calloused hands. Seneca, (Anon, n.d.) Send your Legate to Ostia, O Caesar, but search for him (Anon, n.d.) in some big bar! There he will be, lying cheek-by-jowl beside a cut-throat, in the company of sailors, thieves, and runaway slaves, beside hangm en and coffinmakers, or by some eunuch priest passed out. H ere is Liberty Hall! One cup serves for everybody; no one has a bed to himself, nor a table apart from the rest. Juvenal, Satires 8. As a contrast to virtue, and all it encompassed -not merely a set of sought after values, but its embodiment in estimable institutions and their build ings -Seneca chose the brothel and the bar to symbolise pleasure -itself standing for vice, vulgarity and all that was wretched about the city. To complete the picture, Juvenal portrayed the quality of clientele one would most likely encounter among the dives. These were the scallywags and drunkards, the unsophisticated and unrefined, seeking neither respect nor dignity, but instead gluttony and loose companionship. What is there to learn from the ancient sources about the retail sale of food and drink? Of the 174 references to bar-like activity found among the ancient texts, most overstated the moral turpitude of such establishments, and of those who hung about them.1 It was common to defame another's character by placing them among the bars and taverns, to all hours, with certain emperors not beyond reproach: Gaius Caligula (A.D. 37-41), Claudius , Vitellius (A.D. 69), Lucius Verus were all known to have loitered, at times in disguise, among the city bars.2 But apart from portraying the bars as dens of iniquity, as colourful and entertaining as the image may be, the sources offer but a lim ited scope for inquiry into the role of bars in an ancient and urban com munity. None consider the civic needs of the urban indigents, nor of how these were satisfied through the retail sale of staple foods, cooked meals and even boiled water. The lack of useful information offered by the texts is exacerbated by the fact that, since Tonnes Kleberg's seminal work of almost half a century ago, the study of Roman bars has been firmly rooted in the use of literary sources.3 This has limited the study to themes of ter minology and etymology, yet at the same time Pompeian scholarship remains without a clear understanding of how a food and drink business might be recognised in the archaeological record. The texts were also con cerned with the megalopolis of Rome, while Pompeii was a small South Italian city which, although under the administration of Rome after the Social Wars of the early first century B.C., developed under separate social and localised traditions. So how are we to identify, in a city such as Pompeii, these dens of iniquity, or develop any clearer understanding of their activities and social function? While it is generally agreed that the familiar masonry bar counters served food and drink, no listing of properties with counters has been estab 1 This tally was taken from a search of Latin words most commonly associated, either very generally or specifically, with bar-like establishments in the Packhard Humanities Institute Latin Database. This database lists virtually all known works from Latin authors up to the second cen tury A.D., along with a number of later texts. The following words were searched, returning 174 meaningful instances: tabernae, popinae, cauponae, ganeae, and thermopolia. 2 Caligula (Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Verus 4.5-8); Claudius (Suetonius, Claudius 40); Nero (Tacitus, Annals 13.25; Suetonius, Nero 26-27; Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Verus 4.5-8; Cassius Dio, Roman History 62.14.1-3; Philostratus, Apollonius o f Tyana 4.39-42); Vitellius (Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Verus 4.5-8; Suetonius, Vitellius 13.3); Verus (Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Verus 4.5-8); Commodus (Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Commodus 2.6 -3.7); Gallienus (Scriptores Historiae Augustae, 30 Pretenders (Celsus) 29.1; 30 Pretenders (Ingenuus) 9.1; 30 Pretenders (Marius) 8.9; 30 Pretenders (Postumus) 3.4; Gallieni 21.6). For Otho getting about the taverns as a youth (Suetonius, Otho 2.1). 3 Tonnes KLEBERG, Hôtels, restaurants et cabarets dans l ' antiquité romaine: etudes his toriques et philologiques, (Anon, n.d.) lished to systemise their study. Instead, various Latin terms generally asso ciated with bar-like activities have been applied to an array of building types at various Roman cities.4 For Pompeii this translates into an urban network of buildings labelled tabernae, popinae, cauponae and thermopolia. Attached to these literary terms are a host of activities, in spite of the fact that these references never offer any suggestion of the specific functions or physical characteristics that might be recognisable in the archaeological record today. Moreover, these properties share few common characteristics: some have counters, others do not; some are equipped with hearths and ovens, others are without; and some are large complexes with many rooms, while others are small one-room joints. There is no pattern. Yet in spite of these problems, the traditional approach has been to accept such designa tions, along with their suggestion of specific activities, as though they were primary evidence. What is needed is a more clearly defined recognition that considers all of the available evidence, especially that which actively con tributed toward the operation of each establishment. Reading Roman Ruins: An archaeological definition of the food and drink outlets An on-site survey of Pompeii, conducted by the author between 2000 and 2003, located 158 properties that were once furnished with a bar counter.5 4 Established by Giuseppe FIORELLI, Descrizione di Pompei, Napoli, 1875.

For permission to conduct this survey I warmly thank Pietro Giovanni Guzzo and Antonio d'Ambrosio of the Soprintendenza archeologica di Pompei, both of whom extended unbounded courtesy and assistance along the way. To finance the research I am especially grateful to the fol lowing: the Italian government (for a research scholarship); the University of Sydney (for several Grants-In-Aid and postgraduate research scholarships -the W.C. Wentworth Travelling Fellowship, the James Kentley Memorial Scholarship, the Kath O'Neill Scholarship, and the Hellenic Club Research Scholarship in Classical Archaeology); and not least the committee of the Carlyle Greenwell Research Bequest. Because several of the counters no longer exist, or have since needed sig nificant reconstruction, the survey combined information gleaned from the earliest excavation reports.6 Others remain covered with débris left over from the initial excavations, while some properties reveal just slight traces of where the counter once stood. There is evidence for just three wooden counters, though it is certain more would have existed. The absence of their survival and identification fortifies the arguments below that such a considerable amount of properties with counters be identified as without them.7 The layout of each bar differed remarkably: some were simple, com prising a single room with a wooden staircase to an upstairs mezzanine for storage and accommodation; others had separate ground-floor rooms set out specifically for the storage of commodities, eating areas, or as accom modation; while a number were large complexes with many rooms set aside for the clients to eat and drink. Most had upper floors, though because of the lack of surviving evidence it is difficult to determine precisely the sorts of activities conducted for each example. They were, however, generally considered to have served as the living quarters for the managers and their families, or as guest accommodation, gaming dens, or dining rooms. Of the counters that can be viewed and analysed, their arrangements have the potential to reveal certain activities, in this case, the retail sale of food and drink. This is not to say that every counter in Pompeii defines a bar. The very utilitarian nature of a sales counter suggests that any num ber of goods might be sold from one. Were the history of archaeological excavations at Pompeii more thorough, the various artefacts found at these shops might have facilitated clearer interpretations about their specific type. However this is clearly not the case.8 From the earliest excavations (especially) up till the more recent post WWII clearance, there has been minimal interest in the detailed recording of the artefacts recovered from 6 These were found among the Giornale degli Scavi housed at the Soprintendenza archeologica di Pompei. 7 Wooden counters are known for the properties at I.6.8, (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) The situation is now known as the 'Pompeii premise'. See Lewis BINFORD, \"Behavioural archaeology and the 'Pompeii Premise'\", Journal o f Anthropological (Anon, n.d.)(Michael & Schiffer, 1985). SCHIFFER, \"Is there a Pompeii Premise?\", Journal o f Anthropological (Anon, n.d.), pp. 18-41; and Penelope M.

No less than 130 of the counters were equipped with cooking arrange ments and storage facilities for food. This was generally in the form of a cooking hearth attached to the end of the counter, of which 78 examples are known. The remainder of the hearths, orfoculi as they were known in antiquity, were just a short distance away.10 It is likely that more hearths existed, but the evidence is lost. Those that survive were simple masonrybuilt hearths with a tiled burning surface enclosed by a U-shaped small wall that supported a metal grill or tripod for the cooking vessel.11 That these in-built hearths were placed at the ends of the counters raises ques tions about the expulsion of smoke. Of all the hearths attached to counters, only one retained some sign of an attached chimney. A small terracotta tube was found protruding from the top of the in-built hearth of the count er at IX.11.2.12 However, it is possible that this terracotta tube was used as a means for smoking foods. In any case, this is an unusual example as none of the other hearths show any visible comparanda. Without the use of chimneys it would seem that these types of hearths, located generally two to three metres from the threshold, were reliant upon the spaciousness of the room and the relative proximity to the open facade for circulation. It is equally likely that charcoal was burnt in these hearths which, apart from occupying less storage space (without rotting) and needing but a small area for burning, allows for a very controllable heat while producing consider For the best recent study of the types of cooking arrangements found in Regio I at Pompeii, see Pedar FOSS, Kitchens and dining rooms at Pompeii.. ., op. cit. On the types of cooking pots and other cooking arrangements found throughout the Roman world, see Joan LIVERSIDGE, \"Roman Kitchens and Cooking Utensils\", in Barbara FLOWER and Elisabeth ROSENBAUM edd., The Roman cookery book: a critical translation o f 'The art o f cooking' for use in the study and the kitchen, (Anon, n.d.) ably less smoke.13 The isolated cooking hearths were better equipped for smoke expulsion: these were usually opposite the counter, adjacent to the front entrance, and might also be serviced by a chimney projecting through the front wall so that smoke and accompanying odours -whether fragrant or foul -could waft onto the street. These were larger cooking structures and may have burnt wood as a cheaper fuel. Further evidence for the function of these counters is seen in their stor age provisions, found among most of the extant examples. These were in the form of rectangular or arched voids below the counter, small storage shelves at one end of the counter against the wall, and ceramic vessels built into the top surface of the counter (generally called dolia). But while the storage facilities might be easily recognisable in the structural form of the counter, the sorts of items that were once held by these are much less easy to detect. No finds were reported from the storage voids below the counters, and the explosive nature of the A.D. 79 eruption destroyed any chance of items being found in situ on the shelves.14 As for the inset earthenware vessels, the popular assumption is that they held wine, though no archaeological evidence corroborates this func tion.15 Packer suggested that the vessels were ill equipped to contain liq uids on account of their porous linings and unsuitable shape for cleaning and preserving.16 Fixed into the counter, any left over wine could not be tipped out. It is possible the vessels may have served as storage bays for other more portable vessels filled with liquids, though none have ever been reported in the excavation records. Another likelihood is that skins were placed inside as a non-porous lining, but again no evidence is forthcom ing. It seems likely that the inset containers were reserved primarily for dried goods, and that liquids were kept in nearby portable containers, such as attested by the piles of amphorae stacked by the counter at the best pre served bar in Pompeii.17 Archaeological evidence for the types of goods held by these vessels is rare, but always consists of dried foods, and usu 13 John W. HUMPHREY, John P. OLSEN, and Andrew N. SHERWOOD, Greek and Roman technology: a sourcebook: annotated translations o f Greek and Latin texts and documents, (Anon, n.d.) 14 Take, for example, the counter at I.10.2-3 which was destroyed by the collapsing upper floor. See the Giornali degli (Anon, n.d.). Followed by Helen TANZER, The Common People Of Pompeii: a study o f the graffiti, (Anon, n.d.). The most complete account remains the Notizie degli (Anon, n.d.) ally recorded at the better-preserved city of Herculaneum.18 Here a num ber of inset vessels contained grains, nuts, legumes, beans, and chick peas. (Amedeo et al., 1927) The only known example of a Pompeian bar counter retaining evi dence of food, in this case lentils, comes from the bar at IX.7. (Anon, n.d.) Pompeii does, however, offer epigraphic evidence for the types of food and drink on offer. Listed for sale on the wall of the bar at IX.7.24-25 were var ious commodities and their prices, but without quantities: cheese (1 -2 asses, though soft cheese was 4 asses); bread (8 asses, or 2 asses for 'slave' bread); oil (3 -7 asses); wine (2 -3 asses, but 'champion wine' was con siderably more expensive starting at 1 denarius); onions (5 asses); wheat (1 denarius); cucumbers (1 ass); dates (1 ass); and sausages (1 ass).21 One of the words listed, extremely odd as it is the only known instance in Latin, was H XERES\\ The term is believed to have originated from the Greek, meaning \"dried foods\".22 A well-known wall painting from Ostia, found in the bar on Via di Diana, I.2.5, illustrates further.23 It shows the various foods that would have been sold here: olives, turnips, hard-boiled eggs, and cheeses hanging from a nail in the wall. The painting was significant ly located above a set of display shelves on which some of these foods would have shared space with plates, bowls and cups. This setting is known from of a number of grave reliefs from the Roman world that illus trate bar counters with storage and display shelves stacked with plates and cups, foods and drinks (fig. 2).24 All too often the theme of eating in the Roman world is overshadowed by the habits of the socially privileged, and represented archaeologically by lavish dining rooms with fine wall paintings, spacious gardens and fountains. In Pompeii this image is familiar among the countless grand homes and villas. Their value was measured in the expanse of private space they offered away from the din of city life, space being the great determinate of social class. But what of the poorer classes and those who were without dining couches and reception halls, areas for private social ising, kitchens or even the most basic cooking facilities? Their small and humble living spaces have not been preserved to any great degree; these were sheared off with all the upper floors of Pompeii during the final pyro clastic surge.25 Had they survived it is likely they would have displayed similar living arrangements, albeit less dense, to the lower class living blocks in Rome. The apartments in Rome were found without even the most basic cooking arrangements.26 That the many urban indigents of the various Roman cities relied on food and drink outlets for their daily sup ply of staple foods, cooked and prepared, along with seemingly simple services like boiling water -whether for diluting wine or for any other number of cooking needs -is patently recognisable in the archaeological record of Pompeii.27 What is more, the very amount of these establish ments about the city ought to have drawn a more balanced consideration of their role. The 158 Pompeian bars represent the highest proportion, about 27%, of the various shops in Pompeii, 577 in total.28 While determining the amount of food and drink outlets in Pompeii is use ful for assessing their role, these numbers cannot be fully appreciated without plotting their distribution on a plan of the city (fig. 3). Much has been said about the spatial arrangement of the ancient city, particularly the organization, or not as the case may be, of building types and activi ties, especially since (Anon, n.d.) In regards to Pompeian bars, it has been duly recognised that many were located along the main thoroughfares, and that the general picture was one of a jumbled arrangement.30 Indeed the primary routes were littered with food and drink outlets, the busiest sections being the access routes into and out of the city: no less than 94 (59% of the total) bars can be counted along these roads.31 It is not without significance that food and drink out lets occupied the commercially viable and high-rent street-fronts, a situa tion suggestive of the level of investment placed in them by their owners and tenants.32 That high-profit land was given over to the retail sale of food and drink is further attested by their regular incidence at intersections, the busiest confluence of people and traffic for any urban network. Of the 96 known intersections that connected the vast Pompeian street system, not less than 60 (about two thirds) were bordered by a bar.33 For almost every bar locat ed at one of these bustling intersections, the counter was placed on the optimum side of the facade to allow an unobstructed viewshed for those on the street (fig. 4).34 These were obvious and eye-catching facades designed to attract the attention of passers-by, and their regular occur rence about the city would have been a familiar sight to any Pompeian. But is this pattern of bars found all over the city, and in full view of areas of greatest activity, consistent with what we read among the ancient 30 Tonnes KLEBERG, Hotels..., op. cit., pp 49-53; Gioacchino F. LA TORRE, \"Gli impianti commerciali ed artigianali nel tessuto urbano di Pompei\", in Antonio DE SIMONE ed., Pompeii: Vinformatica al servizio di una citta antica, (Anon, n.d.) This figure is drawn from the roads that originate from an entrance gate into the city. 32 On land value see R.A. RAPER, The Analysis o f the Urban Structure o f P o m p e ii., (Anon, n.d.) For issues of tenancy in Pompeii see Felix PIRSON, \"Rented accommodation at Pompeii: the evidence of the Insula Arriana Polliana VI.6\", in Ray LAURENCE and Andrew WALLACE-HADRILL, Domestic Space in the Roman World: Pompeii and beyond, (Anon, n.d.) On the huge investments in commercial and retail property, and the running of it, see Henrik MOURITSEN, \"Roman freedmen and the urban economy: Pompeii in the first century A.D.\", in Felice SENATORE ed., Pompei tra Sorrento e Sarno: Atti del terzo e quarto ciclo di conferenze di geologia, storia e archeologia. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 1999)(Anon, n.d.) The 60 intersections had 79 of the 158 (50%) Pompeian bars. This represents a remark ably higher proportion than seen by Hermansen at Ostia where just 8 of the 38 bars were located at an intersection -see (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) He found this to be a high proportion for any single profession. It ought to be noted that the figures from Pompeii exclude, quite obviously, the approximate one-third of the city that is yet to be exhumed. 34 The few exceptions to this pattern seem to be those for which the free-placement of the counter was prohibited by the internal or structural arrangement of the front room. commentaries? On the distribution of bars there exists but a few snippets of information in the texts, all subtle in detail. The most revealing are the few that tell of the weary traveller arriving in town to find a bar nearby the city gate, a situation clearly consistent with the archaeology.35 Only a sin gle reference tells of a bar being hidden away from the main thoroughfares: Martial's Epigrammata has a drunken gambler being yanked out of a 'secluded' bar (Anon, n.d.).36 Yet in spite of the relative silence of the ancient sources on the distribution of bars, their united stance on the amoral role of the urban bar pervades this area of inquiry. In an attempt to identify the 'deviant zones' at Pompeii, Ray Laurence cited a number of ancient authors to demonstrate that the presence of bars could determine a zone of the city as unacceptable to the socially élite.37 This approach might at first seem reasonable given the weight of polemic aimed squarely at the urban bar. These were havens of abnormal behaviour, such as \"prostitu tion, 'excessive' alcoholic consumption and gambling\"; in general, any thing that \"contravene[d] the rules of [Pompeian] society.\"38 Persuaded by this premise, and erroneously following the custom of identifying property types by the labels attributed to them in the 19th century, Laurence found that Pompeian bars were located away from the largest houses so that the élites could \"shelter their wives and children from contact with deviants.\"39 In support of this theory, John De Felice insisted \"this was not the result of voluntary placement by business owners nor was it simply a result of businesses simply locating in the busier areas of town. It was a result of civic authority engaging in a type of moral zoning to exclude cer tain types of people and business from the parts of town more likely to (Anon, n.d.) the domain of Roman matrons and children.\"40 This premise contradicts the archaeology. With the abundance of bars along all through routes, and at two out of every three intersections, any attempt at exclusion from such zones would have been not just impractical, but impossible. What is more, many bars can be found nearby, opposite, 37 Laurence defined 'deviant behaviour' as that being \"condemned by a substantial proportion of the population, but is not considered to be beyond the limits of toleration by many people\"see (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) neighbouring, and structurally attached to several of the large and grand homes in Pompeii.41 To so faithfully follow the ancient moralists is to ignore not least the wealth of archaeological remains, but also the intrin sic civic value of retail food and drink outlets, as well as the forces of eco nomic rationality that governed their operation and placement about the city. The intention of this paper was not to negate the use of literary sources. Instead, I have wanted to highlight the traditionally imbalanced approach to the study of food and drink outlets in Pompeii. Of course a number of bars would have served as urban dens of appealing to the com mon classes and earning strict condemnation from the socially privileged. But to reduce the study to a single means of inquiry, itself concerned with but a single aspect, denies the broader social function of food and drink outlets and the true value of their study. The archaeological evidence clearly demonstrates that these were essential features of the urban land scape. The retail sale of staple foods and drink, the provision of a cooked meal and/or cooking facilities, as well as a gathering place to facilitate social conviviality were essential needs of the ancient community. That outlets for these services were in such great number, and so openly dis played at pivotal locations about Pompeii, demonstrates their intrinsic role in the social and economic operation of the city.

Have you ever seen any one more cowed and abject than Marcus Eegulus, since the death of Domitian, under whom he perpetrated infamies as great as under Nero, though with more concealment ? He began to fear that I was angry with him ; and he was not mistaken, for I loas angry. He had fostered the perils which threatened Pais- ticus Arulenus, and had rejoiced in his death to such an extent as to recite and publish a book in which he insulted Ptusticus, and even called him \" that ape of the Stoics.\" He added that he was \" branded with a Vitellian scar.\" * You recognise tlie eloquence of Eegulus ! He mangled Heren- nius Senecio, and with such violence as to cause Mettius Carus to say to him, \" What business have you with my dead ?

Moreover, he remembered in what a deadly manner he had challenged me in the Court of the Centumviri.f I was counsel for Arrionilla, the wife of Timon, at the request of Arulenus Eusticus. Ee- gulus was on the other side. In a certain part of the cause we were relying on a decision of Mettius Modestus, a distinguished man; he was at that time exiled by Domitian. Just see what Eegulus did. \" I ask you,\" says he, \" Secundus, what is your opinion of Modestus ? \" You observe what would have been the danger of giving a * A wound be had received while judges, as the name implies, divided taking the part of Vitellius. -Taci-into Chambers or Courts.

I cannot but think that the Gods themselves, and none else, came to my aid at that moment. \" I will answer,\" said I, \" if it is upon this point that the Judges are to decide.\" He returned to the charge, \" I ask you, what is your opinion of Modestus ? \" I spoke a second time. \"It used to be the custom to summon witnesses against persons on trial, not against those con- victed.\" A third time he said, \" I don't now ask what you think of Modestus, but what of the loyalty of Modestus ? \" \" You ask,\" I replied, \" what I think ; but I apprehend that it is not lawful even to put an inqiiiry in reference to a matter which has been judicially decided.\" He was silenced. I received praise and con- gratulations for not having injured my reputation by an answer which might have been of advantage to me, but would have been dishonourable, and for having at the same time escaped involving myself in the snares of such an insiduous query. So it was that, just now, with a terrified conscience, he laid hold of Cajcilius Celer, and next of Fabius Justus, with a request that they would restore him to my good graces. Not satisfied with this, he made his way to Spurinna ; to him he says in a suppliant tone, most abject as he always is when he is frightened, \" Pray do see Pliny at his house in the morningoh, but very early iu the morning-for I can't bear this anxiety any longer ; and contrive by any means whatever to avert his anger ! \" I was awake when a message arrived from Spurinna : \" I am coming to see you.\" I sent back word that I would rather go to him. \"We met in the Portico of Livia on our way to each other.

Let me know what you are doing: a matter I cannot remain ignorant about without the gravest anxiety. (12.) To Calestpjus Tiro. I have suffered a very heavy loss, if parting with so great a man can be called a loss.* Cornelius Paifus is draw. After casting a glance around, \" Why,\" said he, \" do you suppose that I bear these dreadful pains so long ? In order that I may survive that Irigand* if only for one day ! \" If you could have given him a hody to match his soul, he would have carried into execution what he had in his mind.f However, Heaven granted the prayer, and, feeling that he could now die at peace and a free man, he severed the many but slighter ties which bound him to life. The disease had increased upon him, though he endeavoured to mitigate it by abstinence. His determina- tion rescued him from its persistency. Two, three, four days had already passed. All the time he refused food. His wife, Hispulla, despatched to me a common friend, C. Geminius, with the melancholy news that Corellius had determined to die, and was not to be prevailed upon by her own or her daughter's prayers ; that I was the only person remaining who could recall him to life. I flew to him, and had almost reached his door when Julius Atticus, sent by the same Hispulla, announced to me that by this time not even I could have any effect on him, with such obstinacy had he gone on hardening in his purpose. Indeed, to the physician tendering him food he had said \" KeKpiKa,\" J a M^ord which left in my mind as much regret as admiration. I think what a friend, what a man I have lost. To be sure, he had completed his sixty- seventh year, an age sufficiently advanced even for the strongest, I know it. He has escaped from an unceasing malady. I know it. He has died, leaving a surviving family, and his country, which was dearer to him than all his belongings, in a prosperous condition. I know this too. Nevertheless, I for my part lament his death just as though it were that of a man young and full of vigour, I lament it, moreoverthink me weak if you like on my own account. For I have lost a witness to my BOOK I. ig we praise and approve those who are not discouraged iu their zeal for writing and recitation by this Laziness, or else superciliousness, of their audiences. I for my part have failed scarcely any one. Most of them to be sure were friends. Indeed there is hardly a man who loves literature but what he loves me too. On this account I have spent a longer time in town than I had intended. I can now at last return to my country retreat and write something which shall not be recited, that I may not seem to have been tlie creditor, instead of the hearer, of those at whose recitations I was present. For, as in all other matters, so in this attendance of hearer, the favour ceases to be a favour, if a return be asked for. (Anon, n.d.) To Junius Maueicus. You ask me to look out for a husband for your brother's daughter, and you are right in laying this charge on me in preference to any one else. For you know how greatly I revered and loved that eminent man, how my youth was fostered by his counsels, by what commendations too he brought it about that I should seem worthy of being commended. You could not give me a more important or more agreeable commission, nor is there anything which I could with more propriety undertake, than this selection of a young man to be the parent of Arulenus Eusticus's grandchildren. Yet I should have had to look for him for a long time if he had not been at hand and provided for you, so to speak, in the person of Minicius Acilianus, who is most closely attached to me, as one young man to another (he being my junior by a few years only), and at the same time reveres me as an elder. For it is his desire to be formed and instructed by me in the same way that I used to be by you two. His home is in Brixia, in that part of our country which still retains and preserves much of tlie always new. And I exhort and admonish you to do the same. Nor is it just that the fact of his being alive should stand in the way of his works. Can it be that, if he had flourished among those whom we have never beheld, we should be hunting up not only his books but statuettes of him ; and yet that this same man, because he is now present among us, should find his glory and credit enfeebled through our having, so to speak, too much of liim ? But surely it would be wrong and ill- natured not to admire a man in all respects worthy of admiration, just because it is our good fortune to see, to talk with, to he&r, to embrace him, when besides merely praising him we can love him as well.* (Anon, n.d.) To Cornelius Titianus. Loyalty and duty are still a care to men ; there are still those who play the part of friends even to the dead. Titinius Capito has obtained from our Emperor an authority to put up in the Forum a statue of L. Silanus. 'Tis a noble thing and deserving of all praise to make such a use of the prince's friendship, to try what one's interest is worth by seeking honours for others than one's self. It is quite in Capito's way to pay respect to great men. It is wonderful how reverentially and lovinglyin his own house, where he is at liberty to do sofhe treats the images of a Brutus, a Cassius, a Cato. The same individual has set forth the lives of all the most distinguished men in admirable poetry. You may be sure that he who so loves the virtues of others is himself replete with numerous virtues. So the honour which was his due has been paid to L. Silanus, whose immortality Capito has provided for, while at the same time providing for his * 'Wliich would not be the case if have been allowable to erect statues he were dead. in public to anti-imperialists. + Even under Trajan it would not PLINY'S LETTERS. own. For it is no greater honour and distinction to enjoy a statue in the Forum of the Eoman people than it is to place one there. (i8.) To Suetonius Tkanquillus. You write that you have been terrified by a dream, and are afraid of experiencing some ill-success in your law- suit ; so you beg me to apply for an adjournment, and to get off for a few daysat any rate for the first day. It is a difficult matter, but I will try what can be done. \" For dreams descend from Jove ! \" It is of some consequence, however, whether you are in the habit of dreaming what comes true or the reverse. To me, as I think over a dream of mine, this subject of your fear seems to portend an excellent issue to your suit. I had undertaken the cause of Junius Pastor, when, in my sleep, my mother-in-law appeared to me, in a suppliant posture at my feet, beseeching me not to plead. Now I was about to appear, while yet a stripling, before the four Centumviral courts,* against men of the highest influence in the state, and, what is more, against friends of Csesarcircumstances each of which singly was enough to frighten me out of my wits after such a sad dream. I did, however, plead, reckoning, in the well-known words, that \" The best of omens is my country's cause.\" For here my honour seemed to me to stand in the place of my country, and, if possible, to be dearer to me than my country.f The issue was favourable, and, more than that, it was that very speech which opened for me the ears of men and the gates of fame. In like manner, consider whether you also, with this For all the more jealously should an honour be guarded when at the same time the kindly act of a friend has to be preserved from being disgraced. * Avunculus, his maternal uncle; t About £800. For the Zlecurions. the elder Pliny. see Letter 8, note. of trees even, if only they be beautiful, are enhanced by nothing so much as by their size. The same thing is true of orations; and even books themselves receive a kind of additional authority and beauty from their bulk. These arguments, and many others which are usually urged by me to the same effect, my friendwho is hard to hold, and slips from one in discussiontmanages to evade by contending that these very men whose orations I rely on did not speak at such length as they published. I am of the opposite opinion. Proofs are to be found in PLINY'S LETTERS. the former kind of oratory, \"like the wintry snows,\" that is thick-pouring, continuous, abounding, and, in fine, coming from the gods and the heavens. \" But to many short speeches are more agreeable.\" So they are ; to donothing folks, whose lazy whims it would be ridiculous to look to, as if they could decide the point. If you took counsel of these people, it w^ould be best not merely to speak briefly, but not to speak at all. Such is, up to the present, my opinion, which I shall change if you dissent from it ; but in that case I shall ask you to explain clearly wliy it is that you dissent. For tliough I ought to give in to your authority, yet it seems to me that in a matter of such importance it would be preferable to yield not to authority but to reason. Accordingly, if you do not think me wrong, write to that effectas short a letter as you please -still write, for you will be confirming my judgment. If you do think me wrong, prepare a prodigiously long one. But haven't I bribed you by imposing on you the necessity of a short letter only in case you agree with me, of a prodigiously long one if you differ ? (21.) To Paternus. I place much confidence in the judgment of your eyes as well as in that of your mind ; not because you have much discernment (so don't flatter yourself), but because you have as much as I have ; though, by the by, tliat is a good deal. Joking apart, I consider the slaves bought for me, on your advice, to be proper fellows. It remains to be seen whether they are honest, a point which in the matter of slaves is judged of by the ears better than by the eyes.* * I.e., we shall learn this from the character with them. It is possible character which others will give of that Pliuy had not yet seen them ; them. Doring supposes this letter in that case credo will mean, \" I can to contain a gentle rebuke to Paternus believe that,\" \" I have no doubt that,\" for having bought slaves of good instead of \"I consider,\" as given in appearance, but neglecting to get a the text. BOOK I. To Catilius Severus. I have now been tied to Eome for a considerable time, and in a state of great agitation too. I am distressed by the long and persistent illness of Titius Aristo, the object of my especial admiration and regard. He is indeed unsur- passed in respectability of character, in virtue, in learning ; so that it is not so much one man as letters themselves and all the liberal arts which seem to be in the highest degree imperilled in the person of one man. What a knowledge he has of the law, whether relating to the state or to individuals ! Wliat a quantity of matters, what a quantity of precedents, what a mass of ancient lore, does he hold in his head ! There is nothing you want to learn which he is not able to teach you. To me assuredly, whenever I am searching for some out-of-the-way infor- mation, he is a treasury of knowledge. To begin with, how reliable are his observations, and how weighty too, how modest and becoming his caution ! What is there that he does not know offhand ? Yet he constantly hesi- tates and deliberates, owing to the conflict of reasons which, with his keen and powerful judgment, he traces up to their sources and first principles, distinguishing between them and balancing them. Add to this his abstemiousness at table and the sobriety of his attire. His very chamber and his couch itself always seem to me, when I look at them, to present a kind of image of old-world simplicity. All these qualities are set off by the grandeur of his soul, which does nothing with a view to display, and everything with a view to conscience, and seeks for the reward of virtuous deeds not from the applause of the vulgar, but from the deeds themselves. In short, none of your philo- sophers, who ad-vertise their love of wisdom by their external appearance, will easily stand a comparison with such a man as this. He does not, to be sure, haunt the gym- It will be no mean solace to my perturbed mind that you have nothing to complain of. (Anon, n.d.) To PoMPEius Falco. You ask my opinion as to whether you ought to plead causes during your tribuneship. It makes a vast difference what you hold the tribuneship to bewhether an empty shadow and a mere name without honour, or an authority invested with the highest sanctions, such as should suffer degradation at the hands of no man, least of all at those of the holder. With regard to myself during my tenure of the office, I may perhaps have erred in imagining myself to be of some account ; yet, just as though I had been, I abstained from pleading causes. And this, firstly, because it appeared to me most unseemly that one in whose pre- sence every one is bound to rise, and to give place, should himself stand while every one else is sitting ; next, that one who can impose silence on all should himself be silenced by the hour-glass ; again, that he whom it is unlawful to interrupt should have to listen to actual scurrilities, and be looked upon as mean-spirited if he passed them over, and arrogant if he punished them. Moreover, there was this difficulty before my eyes ; suppose I had been appealed to in my official capacity, either by the person for whom, or the one against whom, I appeared. Should I interpose as tribune and aid him ? or should I keep quiet and hold my tongue, abdicating, so to speak, my magisterial office, and constituting myself a private individual ? Moved by these considerations, I preferred to exhibit myself as a tribune to all rather than an advocate to a few. But as to you, I repeat, it makes a vast difference what you hold the tribuneship to be, and what sort of part you propose to play, which, in the case of a wise man, should be so fitted to him that it may be played out to the end. c always disagreeable, chiefly because it seems to reproach its OMmer with his folly. Now, in this little property, if the price be only favourable, there is much to tempt the fancy of my friend Tranquillusthe neighbourhood of the city, the easiness of access, the moderate size of the house, the extent of the land, enough to amuse, not to engross him. For your scholars (and such he is), when they are proprietors, are amply satisfied with so much of the soil as permits them to lift their heads from their books, refresh their eyes, crawl along their boundaries, always keeping to the same path, knowing all their tiny vines, and able to number their diminutive shrubs. This I have set before you .that you may better understand how much he will owe to me, and I to you, if he buys this little country place, recommended by so many attrac- tions, at such a reasonable price as not to leave room for repentance. ( 35 ) BOOK II. To EOMANUS. It is some years since such a splendid, and indeed memorable, spectacle has been exhibited to the eyes of the Eoman people, as that of the public funeral of Verginius Eufus, a citizen of the greatest distinction and renown, and one who was fortunate in an equal degree. For thirty years he survived his glorious deeds ; he read poems, he read histories WTitten about himself ; he was a witness to his own fame with posterity. He passed through his third consulship, thereby filling the loftiest station open to a subject, since he had refused that of a prince. He escaped those emperors by whom he had been suspected, and even hated, on account of his virtues ; and the best of them, the one who loved him most, he left behind him in life, as though he had been reserved for this very honour of a public funeral. He outlived his eighty-third year, in the most perfect composure of mind, and the object of corresponding veneration. He enjoyed robust health, ex- cept that his hands used to shake, yet short of feeling pain. Only, the approach of death * was somewhat severe and tedious ; though this circumstance itself was a credit to liim. For as he was practising his voice,t in view to a speech of thanks which he had to make to the Emperor, on liis appointment as consul, tlie book he held, which happened to be of considerable size, slipped out of his handsaged as he was, and in a standing posture tooby its own weight. In the act of snatching at it to hold it together,* his foot failed him on the polished and slippery- floor; he fell and broke his hipbone, and his years pre- venting its being properly set, it would not come together again as it should. The obsequies of this great man have reflected the highest lustre upon the prince, upon the age, and upon the Forum and Eostra as well. His eulogy was pronounced by Cornelius Tacitus. What a supreme crowning point to his good fortune to obtain the most eloquent of eulogists ! So lie, is gone, full of years and full of honours, even of those which he refused. We have to miss him and regret him as a model of a bygone age ; I, for my part, particularly, who loved as much as I admired him, and that not merely from a public point of view. For, firstly, we came from the same part of the country ; our chief towns were contiguous ; and more than this, our estates and pro- perty joined each other. In the next place, he was left my guardian, and always exhibited towards me the affec- tion of a parent. So it was that, on the occasions of my candidature, he honoured me with his voice ; so he always hastened from his retirement to welcome me in all the offices I held, though he had long since given up this kind of complimentary visit ; so on the day when the Augurs usually nominate those whom they judge most worthy of the Augurship, he always nominated me. Nay more, dur- ing this last illness of his, fearing that he might chance to be appointed on the commission of five for reducing the public expenditure, which was being constituted by a decree of the Senate, although so many of his friends survived who were old men and of consular rank, he selected me, at my present age, as his substitute, and in these words too : \" I would even intrust my son to you, if * The usual form of Roman books must be borne in mind. BOOK IL 37 I had one.\" * These are the reasons which ohlio-e me to O pour my griefs into your bosom for a death which seems almost premature; if indeed it he allowable either to grieve for, or to call by the name of \" death \" at all, that which has put an end to the mortal existence rather than the life of so great a man. For he lives still, and will live for ever; he will even occupy a larger share in the thoughts and discourse of men now that he is withdrawn from their eyes. There were many other things which I wished to write to you, but my mind is entirely a prey to this one subject of contemplation. I think of Verginius. I see Verginius. I hear, address, grasp Verginius in what are now vain but lively images. We possess, it may be, and shall hereafter possess, citizens his equals in great qualitiesin renown no one ! (2.) To Paulinus. I am angry without being clear that I ought to be. Still I aril angry. You know that affection is occasionally unjust, often headstrong, at all times quarrelsome about trifles. Here, at any rate, is a weighty reasonwhether a just one or not I don't know. However, taking it to be as just as it is weighty, 1 am grievously angry with you for not having sent me any letters for such a long time. There is only one way in which you can obtain my for- giveness, and that is by now at all events writing to me frequently and at great length. This is the only excuse which will seem to me valid ; all others will be treated as false. I am not going to listen to this kind of thing -\" I was not at Eome,\" or \" I was too busy,\" As for this -\" I w^as too unwell,\" why, the gods won't allow of that being said, I hope. I myself am at my country-house, in the enjoyment partly of study, partly of indolence : retirement is the parent of both. (3-) To Nepos. Great was the reputation which had preceded Isseus, yet he was found to surpass it. His powers of speech, his copiousness, his richness are extraordinary. He always speaks extemporaneously, but just as though everything had been written out long before. His language is Greek, indeed Attic. His prefatory remarks are terse, graceful, and agreealjle, at times of a grave and lofty tone. He calls for several subjects of discussion, and allows his hearers to make their choice, frequently even to select their sides. He rises and composes his attire, then he begins. At once, and almost at the same moment, every- thing comes to his hand, profound ideas present them- selves, and expressionsoh, such expressions ! -so choice and polished ! In these offhand effusions, a great amount of reading, a great habit of composition, are revealed. His preludes are to the point, his narratives clear, his attacks vigorous, his embellishments noble : in short, he teaches, delights, and moves you, so that you are in doubt as to which he does best. He indulges in frequent \" enthymemata,\" * frequent syllogisms, concise and reasoned out, such as it is difficult to produce even with pen in hand. His memory is incredible ; he will repeat from a long way back what he has spoken extempore, without a mistake in a word. To this degree of skill has he attained by study and practice ; for night and day he applies himself to nothincf else, hears and talks of nothing else. He has passed his sixtieth year, and is still a scholar and nothing else-a class of men than whom none are more honest and straisjlitforward. For we who undersjo the friction of the courts and of real lawsuits acquire a great spice of roguishuess into the bargain, albeit unwillingly.* Schools and lecture-rooms and fictitious causes are inno- cent and harmless affairs, and no less sources of enjoyment, particularly to old men. For what can be a greater source of enjoyment in age than that which is most delightful in youth ? Wherefore I for my part esteem Isceus not only the most eloquent but the happiest of men ; and if you are not eager to make his acquaintance, you must be made of stone or of iron. So, come, if not on other accounts, nor on my account, at any rate that you may hear him. Have you never read how a certain man of Gades,t moved by the name and renown of Titus Livius, came from the extremity of the earth for the purpose of seeing him, and the moment he had seen him went back \\ It would be \" wanting in a sense of the beautiful,\" it would be the part of an illiterate, it would be dulness and almost disgrace, not to regard such an acquaintance as worth the troublethan which none can be pleasanter, none more honourable, in short, none more conformable to nature. You will perhaps say, \" I have here authors no less elo- quent, whom I can read.\" Very true ; but there is always an opportunity for reading, and not always one for hearing. Besides, we are much more affected, to use a common ex- pression, by the living voice. For even suppose what you read to possess greater spirit, yet there will remain more deeply seated in your mind what the pronunciation, countenance, demeanour, and even the gestures of the speaker have implanted there. Unless, indeed, we esteem as false the well-known remark of ^schines, who, when he had read to the PJiodians an oration of Demosthenes, amidst universal applause, is reported to have added, \"What if you had heard the roar of the least himself?\" And yet ^schines, if we are to believe Demosthenes, was * Or, \"however unwilling we may sense of cunning and artifice. be.\" Malitia is used here in tiie f Cadiz. \" extremely clear-voiced.\" He confessed, however, that the same oration would have been delivered far more effectively by the author in person. All which goes to this, to make you hear Isffius, if only to be able to say that you have heard him. (4.) To Calvina. If your father had been in debt to a number of people, or to any single individual in the world, other than myself, it would very likely have been a matter of doubt whether you ought to enter on the administration of his estate,* which would have been a troublesome matter even for a man. But since, moved by the ties of consanguinity, I constituted myself his sole creditor by paying off all the rest (who, I won't say, were more pressing, but who at any rate looked more carefully after their money) ; and since, moreover, during his lifetime, I contributed a hundred thousand sesterces towards your wedding portion, besides that sum which your father guaranteed out of my property, as it were (for it was out of my property that it had to be paid)in all this you have a strong pledge of my kindly feeling towards you, in full reliance on which you ought to defend your departed parents' reputation and banded, that it may not be dried up by too great profusion. It shall be husbanded, however, in the case of others : in yoiiT case, there will be a ready justification, even if the bounds be exceeded. (5.) To LUPEKCUS. I have sent you the speech which you have so frequently pressed me for, and which has been so often promised by me ; not, however, as yet the whole of it, for a portion of it is still under final revision. Meanwhile I have thouo;ht it not amiss to submit to your appreciation those parts wdiich appeared to me to be in a finished state. On these I beg you to bestow the same close attention which they received from their author ; for never yet have I had any- thing in hand which required me to exhibit more watchful care. In my other speeches, my diligence only and trust- worthiness were submitted to the judgment of mankind ; here, further, my patriotism was concerned. Hence, the book itself has grown, while I rejoiced to celebrate and dilate upon my native country, and at the same time to help to defend it,* as well as to glorify it. Do you, however, cut out these very passages as far as reason shall dictate. Tor when I consider the censoriousness and the whims of readers, I understand that their favour is to be sought by the moderate size in particular of a book. Yet, while exacting from you this strictness, I am at the same time compelled to put in an opposite request, that you will look with indulgence on many passages. Some conces- sions must be made to youthful ears, particularly if the subject-matter is not opposed to such handling. It is surely allowable to treat descriptions of places, which will be rather numerous in this book, not merely in a historical but almost in a poetical fashion. If, however, there be any one who thinks I have done this in a lighter way than the serious character of the oration requires, the severity, if I may so express it, of this reader must needs be deprecated by the remaining portions of the speech. I have at any rate striven to interest readers of the most opposite characters, by a great variety of styles, and just as I fear that particular parts will not, in accordance with individual tastes, be approved by some, so T am pretty confident that this very variety will commend the book to all as a whole. For even in taking account of a banquet, though individually we may abstain from a number of dishes, yet we often unite in praising the dinner as a whole, nor do those viands which our taste rejects take away from the merit of those which have attracted it. Now I wish all this to be understood, not as believing myself to have succeeded, but as having laboured to suc- ceed, and that perhaps not in vain, if only you will devote your attention in the interim to what I have sent, and presently to what will follow. You will say that you cannot do this thoroughly unless you are first made acquainted with the entire speech. I admit it. For the present, however, what I have sent will become more familiar to you, and in this there will be certain correc- tions capable of being made in the parts. For if you were to inspect a head broken off from a statue, or some limb or other, though of course you could not gather from it its harmony and proportion to the rest, yet you might judge whether, taken by itself, it was a work of art or not. For this and no other reason, specimen numbers of books are circulated, because it is believed that a part may be complete in itself without the remainder. The kind of charm there is in conversing with you has led me further than was intended ; here, however, I must end, for fear the limits which in my opinion should be observed even in an oration be exceeded in a letter. BOOK II. To AviTUS. It would be tedious to recall, nor is it of any conse- quence, how it came to pass that I (though but slightly acquainted with him), dined with a certain gentleman who unites, in his own estimation, splendour with economy, in mine, meanness with extravagance. For he and a few others had the best of everything served them, while the rest of the company had common fare and mere scraps. Even the wine he had divided into three sorts, in little flagons; not that people might have the power of choosing, but that they might not have the right of decliniug ; one sort for himself and us, another for his humbler friends (for he puts his friends into categories), another for his and our freedmen. My next neighbour at table remarked upon this, and asked me if I approved of it. I said, No. \" What custom, then, do you follow ? \" says he. \" I set the same fare before everybody; for I invite people to dine, not to be invidiously ticketed, and I treat as my entu'e equals in all respects those whom I have made already my equals by placing them at my table .\" \" What, your freedmen too ? \" \" Certainly ; for then I look on them as my guests, not my freedmen.\" \" It must cost you a great deal,\" says he. \" Not at aU,\" I replied. \" How can that be ? \" \" Why, because my freedmen don't drink the same wine that I do, but I drink the same wine as my freedmen.\" And, by Hercules, if you only restrain your gluttony, it is no great hardship to share with a number of others what you use yourself. This gluttony, then, must be kept in check; it must, so to speak, be reduced to the ranks, if you would moderate your expen- diture ; and it is somewhat better to arrange for this by curbing yourself rather than by insulting other people. To what end all this ? In order that the show which some people make at their tables may not impose on memory of the deceased and the grief of his father, but also for an example. Youth will be incited to the practice of virtue by the establishment of such prizes, open to lads even, provided they be worthy of them. Men of lofty station will be incited to raise children, not only by their joy in those who survive, but by such glorious consolations in the case of those who are lost. Tor these reasons I rejoice in the statue to Cottius on public grounds, and no less on private ones. I loved that most consummate young man as ardently as I now impatiently regret him. So it will be very pleasant to me to gaze from time to time upon this effigy of him; from time to time look back at it, to stand under it, to pass by it. For if likenesses of the departed set up in our houses alleviate our grief, how much more must those which, standing in the most frequented places, recall not their appearance and their expression only, but also their great- ness and their glory. (Anon, n.d.) To Caninius. Are you studying ? or fishing ? or hunting ? or uniting all these pursuits ? They can all be united at my Larian place. The lake abounds in fish, the woods which surround the lake in game, and that profoundest of retreats in incentives to study. However, whether you are com- bining them all, or engaged in any one of them, though I can't say \" I envy you,\" yet I am distressed that these pursuits are not permitted we, which I yearn for as sick people yearn for wine, baths, and spring water. Shall I never be able to break through, if unable to loosen them, these bonds which so closely confine me ? Never, I imagine. For fresh business is always growing on to the old, and yet the old is not completed. So numerous are the coils, so numerous the links, so to speak, by which the chain of my occupations is daily extended. (9.) To Apollinaris. The candidature of my friend Sextiis Erucius causes me anxiety and disquiet. I am troubled with apprehensions, and the uneasiness which I did not feel on my own account I am now enduring on his, as though for another self. Moreover, my honour, my reputation, my consideration are at stake. I it was who obtained the Lotus clavus * for Sextus from our Emperor. I it was who procured the Quffistorship for him. It was on my recommendation that he obtained the right of standing for the tribuneship ; and if he does not get the office from the Senate, I fear I shall seem to have deceived the Emperor. Accordingly, every effort must be used by me in order that the world at large shall judge him to be such as the prince, on my representation, believed him to be. And if my zeal were not stimulated by this cause, I should in any case wish to see supported a young man of great virtue, principle, and attainments, one, in short, worthy of all praise, as are, indeed, the whole of his family. For his father is Erucius Clarus, a person of the purest character and of antique mould, an eloquent man, and a skilful pleader in court, conducting his cases with extreme conscientiousness, like determination, and no less modesty. He has for his maternal uncle C. Septicius, than w^hom I have never known a sincerer, more straightforward, more guileless, more reliable man. As they all vie in loving me, and yet love me equally, so now in the person of one of them I can make a return to all. Accordingly, I am suing my friends, soliciting, canvassing, going the round of houses and public resorts, and ascertaining by my entreaties what I am worth in the way either of influence or interest. And I beg you will think it worth your while to take some share of my burden. I will requite you, if you ask for a return ; ay, and even if you don't ask for one. You are clierisbed, courted, you have a numerous society; only show that you wish for a thing, and there will he no lack of those to whom your wishes will be objects of desire. (Anon, n.d.)

Forbear, then, to defraud your labours of a reward so great and so assured, by this endless hesitation, which, when it exceeds the bounds, may, there is cause to fear, come to be styled laziness, indolence, and supineness, perhaps even cowardice. (Anon, n.d.) To Arkianus. You are in general delighted when any business has been transacted in the Senate worthy of that body. For though your love of repose has sent you into retirement, yet there remains implanted in your mind a regard for the dignity of the commonwealth. Listen, then, to the transactions of the last few days, memorable from the great posi- tion of the personage concerned, salutary from the severity of the example set, and immortal owing to the magnitude of the affair. Marius Priscus, being accused by the Africans, whom he had governed as proconsul, declined to defend himself, and requested to have judges assigned him.* Cornelius Tacitus and I, who had been appointed counsel for the pro- vincials, deemed it a part of our duty to inform the Senate that Priscus by his enormities and cruelties had trans- cended such charges as are capable of having judges assigned them, inasmuch as he had received bribes for the condemnation, and even the slaughter, of innocent persons. Pronto Catius, in reply, deprecated inquiry being made into anything that was not covered by the * I.e., He declined defending liira-the graver charges brought against self in the Senate, and asked for a him. If, then, the Senate had sent trial before judges. These judges him before this court or commission, would be empowered to inquire into it would have been held to acquit the charges of extortion, &c., and him of, or at least to condone, the assess damages. But it seems they weightier charges, would not be entitled to examine into BOOK 11. -49 law against bribery and extortion : and expert as lie is at moving tears, he filled all the sails of his speech with a kind of breeze of commiseration. Tliere was much dis- puting and clamouring on either side, some declaring that the jurisdiction of the Senate was bounded by the law ; * others that it was free and unfettered, and that in pro- portion as the accused had sinned, so he should be punished. At last, Julius Ferox, consul-elect, an honour- able and upright man, pronounced himself in favour of assigning judges to Marius in the interim, and, at the same time, summoning those to whom, it was said, he had sold the penalties inflicted on innocent persons. This opinion not only prevailed, but was absolutely the only one which, after these great disputes, was numerously followed. Indeed, it has been shown by experience that although the first impulses of partiality and compassion are apt to manifest themselves with fire and vehemence, yet they will settle down gradually, extinguished, so to speak, by reflection and consideration. Hence it comes to pass that an opinion which a number of people will support with a confused clamour, no one will be willing to pronounce, when the rest are holding their tongues. Tor, when you are separated from the crowd, you get a clear view of many things which the crowd serves to conceal. Those who had been summoned to attend made their appearance -Vitellius Honoratus and Flavins Marcianus. Of these, Honoratus was charged with having bought, for three hundred thousand sesterces,t the banishment of a Eoman knight and the capital punishment of seven of his friends : Marcianus with having bought, for seven hun- dred thousand,\"!\" a combination of penalties inflicted on one Eoman knight; for he had been beaten with cudgels, * Their argument seems to have stopped from proceeding furthera been that Marius had virtually pleaded strange argument, guilty to the charge of extortion, &c. , f About £2400. by demanding judges to estimate I About £5600. damages, and that the Senate was D condemned to work in the mines, and finally strangled in prison. Honoratus, however, was withdrawn from the cognisance of the Senate by a timely death, and Marcianus was brought in, in the absence of Prisons. Upon this, Tuccius Cerialis, a man of consular rank, proposed, in virtue of his senatorial right, that Prisons should have notice : either with the idea that he would be a greater object of compassion, or perhaps, on the other hand, of odium, if he were present ; or else (as I am strongly in- clined to believe) because it was most in accordance with justice that an accusation common to both should be met by each of them, and if it could not be refuted, should be punished in the person of each. The alfair was postponed till the next meeting of the Senate, the mere aspect of 'which was extremely grand. The Emperor presided, for he happened to be consul: add to this that it was the month of January, one of particular note on other ac- counts,* and also especially from the number of senators it brings together : moreover, the importance of the cause, the expectation and fame of it, which had increased by its postponement, the eagerness, innate in mortals, for an acquaintance with what is remarkable and unusual : all this had called forth every one from every quarter. Picture to yourself our anxiety and apprehension, who had to speak on an affair of such moment in that assembly and in the presence of the Emperor. For my part, I have spoken in the Senate, and not once only ; more than that, there is no place where I am habitually listened to with greater favour ; and yet, at the moment, everything seemed strange to me, and pervaded me with a strange apprehension. In addition to the particulars above mentioned, the difficulties of the case presented themselves to me : there stood a man but lately of consular rank, lately * It was the month when the new gwenim, when the sense of ceZe6emmMS magistrates entered on their offices, will be different, and the meaning Mensis cum cetera turn praecipue will be, \"A month which brings Senatoriini frequentia celeberrimus. together a number of senators in Cetera might here be taken with fre-particular, besides other people.\" BOOK IT. 5 1 a member of a sacred college ; now, neither.* It was especially disagreeable, tlien, to have to accuse one already convicted, a man who, though weighed down by the enor- mity of his crimes, was yet in like manner protected by the pity resulting from his having been previously, and, as it might seem, finally condemned.-f-However, I col- lected my mind and my thoughts, and began to speak with no less approval on the part of my audience than anxiety on my own. I spoke for nearly five hours : to twelve water-clocks of most liberal measure which had been allowed me, four fresh ones were added.! So greatly did the very topics which seemed to me, before speaking, to present difficulties, and to make against me, turn to my advantage when I did speak. The Emperor, indeed, showed such favour towards me, such care for me even (perhaps solicitude would be too strong a term), that he frequently suggested to my freedman, who stood behind me, to beg me spare my voice and my strength, whenever he thought I was exerting myself with greater vehemence than my delicate frame might be able to bear. Claudius Marcellinus replied to me on behalf of Marcianus. There- upon the Senate rose, being adjourned to the following day ; for by this time a fresh speech could not have been entered on without being cut short by nightfall. iSText day, Marius was defended by Salvius Liberalis, a subtle, methodical, incisive, eloquent speaker, and to be sure in this case he put forth all his powers. Cornelius Tacitus answered him with great eloquence, and, what is remarkable in his style of speaking, with great dignity. Fronto Catius rejoined on behalf of Marius, in an excellent * The Judices (judges) had con-the sentence of the Judices ; that no demned him for bribery since the more cliarges should be brought previous sitting of the Senate. against him.

The evening closed this speech, yet not so as to interrupt it. So the proceedings lasted into a third day. Surely this was in itself admirable and in the good old style : that the sittings of the Senate were closed by nightfall, that it was called together for three days, and kept together for three days. Cornutus TertuUus, consul-elect, a man of great distinction and unswerving integrity, moved that the seven hundred thousand sesterces which Marius had received should be paid into the Treasury, and that IMarius himself should be banislied from Eome and from Italy ; Marcianus from Africa into the bargain. By way of conclusion to his motion, he farther proposed that inas- much as Tacitus and I had discharged the ofhce of advocate imposed on us with diligence and intrepidity, the Senate adjudged that we had acted in a way worthy of the func- tions assigned us. The consuls-elect assented to this motion, and, indeed, all the men of consular rank, till it came to the turn of Pompeius Collega : he opined for pay- ing the seven hundred thousand into tlie Treasury, and also banishing* Marcianus for five years, but for being contented, in the case of ]\\Iarius, with the penalties for bribery which he had already incurred. There were many for each of these proposals ; perhaps, on the wliole, a majority for the latterthe more lenient, not to call it the laxer, of the two. For some even of those who had seemed to agree with Cornutus now followed this senator, who had given his opinion after themselves. However, when a division took place, those who stood by the consuls' chairs began to go over to the side of Cornutus. Whereupon, those who still allowed themselves to be numbered with Collega crossed to the opposite side of the House, and Collega was left with a small following. The latter complained after- BOOK II. 53 wards a good deal of tliose who had set him on, particu- larly of Regulus, who had left him in the lurcli on a motion which he (Regains) had himself prompted. Indeed Eegulus is generally of such a fluctuating disposition, that he is full of daring and full of cowardice as well. Such was the end of this most important investigation. There still remains, however, a public matter of some importancethe aftair of Hostilius Firminus, lieutenant to Marius Priscus, wdio was implicated in the cause, and got very roughly handled. For Martianus's cash accounts, and also a speech which he made to the senators of Leptis, proved that he had lent his aid to Priscus for services of the basest kind; that he had covenanted for fifty thousand denarii* to be paid by Marcianus; that he had further received in person ten thousand sesterces, under a most disreputable title, that of \" purveyor of perfumes,\" a title not ill-suited to the manners of the man, wdth his per- petual trimmed hair and levigated skin. It was resolved, on the motion of Cornutus, that his case should be laid before the Senate at its next meeting ; for at that time, whether accidentally or from the effect of conscience, he was absent. So now you have the news of the town. Write me in return that of the country. How are your shrubs doing, and your vineyards, and your corn crops, and those choice sheep of yours ? In a word, send me back a letter as long as my own, or else henceforth look for none but the shortest of letters from me. (Anon, n.d.) To Arrianus. The \" public matter \" which, as I lately wrote you word, was a remanet after the trial of Marius Priscus, has been \"trimmed and shaved,\"* whether satisfactorily or not I cannot say. Firminus, brought before the Senate, answered to a charge which was patent. Then followed conflicting proposals on the part of the consuls-elect. Cornutus Tertullus moved that he be expelled the Senate ; Acutius IS^erva that in the assignment by lot of provinces his name be left oiit.f This latter proposal carried the day, as being the more lenient, whereas it is, in fact,| the harsher and severer of the two. For what can be more miserable than to be cut off and excepted from the privileges of the senatorship, and yet not to be exempt from its labours and its annoyances ? What can be more oppressive than for a man, to whom such ignominy has been attached, not to be able to hide away in solitude, but to have to exhibit him- self as a sight and a show on so lofty an eminence ? In addition to this, what, from a public point of view, can be more incongruous or more indecent than that a person branded by the Senate should sit in the Senate, and should be on equal terms with the very persons who have branded him; that one debarred from a proconsulship for his dis- graceful conduct in his lieutenancy should yet sit in judg- ment on proconsuls, and, after being condemned for his own dirty practices, should condemn or acquit others. Yet so the majority decided. Votes, you know, are numbered, not weighed. Nor can this be otherwise in a public assembly, where there is nothing so unequal as this very equality ; for though the members are not on a par in point of sagacity, yet they are all on a par in the right to vote. I have carried out my promise, and fulfilled the engage- ment contained in my former letter, which, from the time that has elapsed, I conclude you must have already re- ceived ; for I intrusted it to a speedy and careful mes- BOOK 11. 55 senger, unless he has met with some hindrance on his way. It is your turn now to repay, first my former missive, next this one, by a return letter charged with as much matter as possible from your neighbourhood. (Anon, n.d.) To Pkiscus. Not only do you seize with avidity every opportunity of obliging me, but I too, for my part, would rather be in your debt than any one else's. So, for a double reason, I have determined to apply to you before all others for a favour which I am greatly anxious to obtain. You are in command of a very fine army ; so there has been ample material for your favours ; and, besides, the time has been long during which you have had it in your power to advance your own friends. Now turn your attention to mine; they shall not be numerous. You, to be sure, would prefer they were numerous ; but my modesty is satisfied with one or two, say rather one, and that one shall be Voconius Eomanus. His father was a distin- guished member of the Equestrian order; still more distinguished is his step-father, or rather his second father, for to such a name his pious affection has entitled him to succeed. Spain. You know the character of that province for dis- cretion and solidity. He himself was lately Flamen. When we were fellow-students I had a close and intimate regard for him ; he was my associate in town and country ; with him I shared my serious and my sportive hours. Where indeed could there be found a more faithful friend or a more entertaining companion? Marvellous is the charm of his conversation; marvellous that of his very countenance and expression. Add to this an intelligence of a lofty character, subtle, agreeable, ready, accomplished in pleading causes. As for the letters he writes, you would imagine the Muses in person were talking Latin. Greatly as he is beloved by me, lie does not yield to me in affection. For my part, when we were young men together, I was most eager to do everything for him that lay in my power at that time of my life ; and I have lately obtained for him from our gracious prince the rights of those who have three children ; * rights which the latter, though according them sparingly and with discrimination, nevertheless conceded at my request as though the selec- tion had been his own. These services rendered by me I can maintain in no better way than by adding to them ; especially as Voconius himself acknowledges them so gratefully as by his receipt of previous favours to merit future ones. You now know what the man is, how approved and dear to me. Advance him then, I pray you, in a way which accords with your disposition and station. First of all, love the man. For though you bestow on him the greatest gifts in your power, you can bestow nothing greater than your friendship. And that he is worthy f of that, even to the most intimate degree of familiaritythat you might the better know this, I have briefly portrayed to you his pursuits, his character, in short, his whole life. I would protract my prayers were it not that you would be unwilling to be furtlier entreated, and that I have been praying all through this letter. For he entreats, and that too in the most efficacious way, who gives reasons for his entreaties. for me rather than pleasure. For most of them are trumpery and insignificant ; rarely does one occur that is noticeable from the position of the parties or the import ance of the issue. Add to this that there are few in whose company I care to plead ; the remainder are im- pudent fellows, and indeed for the most part obscure striplings, who have come there for the purpose of de- claiming ; and with such want of propriety and reckless- ness, that my friend Attilius seems to have expressed it exactly when he said, \" Boys commence with Centumviral causes at the bar as they do with Homer at school.\" Here, as there, what is first in importance has come to be taken first in time. But, by Hercules, before my day (so old people will tell you), young men, even of the highest f imilies, were not admitted to practice, except upon the introduction of some man of consular rank ; such was the respect paid to this noble profession. Now-a-days all barriers of shame and respect are broken down; every- thing is open to everybody ; they are no longer introducedthey rush in. The pleaders are followed by an audience of the same stamp, hired and bought for the purpose ; a bargain is made with a speculator; in the middle of the court, presents are distributed as openly as in the dining- room. For a like consideration, these people will pass from one court to another. Hence they are humorously called \" Sophocless,\" * and have received the Latin name of \" Laudiceni.\" t And yet this vile practice, thus stig- matised in both languages, grows day by day. Yesterday two of my nomenclators % (to be sure they are of the age of those who have just assumed the toga ! §) were being carried off to applaud by a gift of three denarii apiece. Such is the price wliich it will cost you to become an * 'Zo(\\)ok\\m, shouters of \"bravo,\" the names of people whom they with a humorous reference to the met. tragedian's name. orator of the first water. For tliis sum the benches, however numerous, are filled ; for the same, a huge crowd is collected, and no end of cheering called forth, as soon as the leader of the chorus has given the signal. A signal is of course wanted for people who don't understand, who don't even listen ; for most of them do not listen, nor are there any who applaud more heartily than these. If you should happen at any time to be passing through the court-house, and should wish to know how each speaker acquits himself, there is no necessity for going on the platform or listening to the speeches ; it is easy to guess ; be assured that he is the worst speaker who receives the greatest applause. The first person who introduced this style of audience was Largius Licinus, yet only to the extent of bringing people together to hear him, by simple invitation : so, certainly, I remember to have heard from my tutor, Quin- tilian. He used to tell this story : \" I was in the habit of attending on Domitius Afer. As he was once pleading before the Centum viri, slowly and impressively (for this was his style of speaking), he heard from a neighbouring court * an extraordinary and unusual noise. He paused in astonishment. \"When silence was restored, he resumed where he had broken off. Once more the noise, once more a pause on his part. After a fresh silence, he continued his speech for the third time. At last, he inquired w^ho was speaking, and the reply was \" Licinus.\" Upon this, he threw up his brief, with the observation, \" Judges, my profession is at an end !\" And indeed in other ways it was coming to an end at the time when Afer thought it ended : oioio, of a truth it is well-nigh utterly extinguished and destroyed. I am ashamed to allude to the mincing falsetto t in which the speeches are uttered, and the offen- * This tribunal was divided into of a weak, feminine voice (many of several courts or chambers, as we these speakers, we have just;been told, have seen above. were mere striplings), and also an + Fractd voce seems from this and affected lisp or drawl, other passages, to include the ideas ^BOOK II. . 59 sive character of the clieering which greets them. Clap- ping of hands only, or rather cymbals and drums alone, are wanting to these sing-song performances ; yells, however (there is indeed no other word to express a kind of applause which would be indecent even in a theatre), are in great superfluity. For myself, however, I am still kept in these courts, and prevented from leaving them by the requirements of my friends and a consideration of my own age ; * for I fear people might perhaps think I was not so much turning my back on these discreditable scenes as shirking hard work. However, I go there more rarely than my habit was, and this is a commencement of gradually retiring from them. (ISO To Valerianus. How does your old Marsian property treat you ? And your new purchase ? Are you pleased with the estate, now that it is your own ? A rare thing, to be sure !

This provision of the law was not unknown to me either, considering that it is known even to those who are ignorant of everything else. But I have bound myself by a kind of law of my own, to carry out the wishes of the dead, even though legally incomplete, just as though they were in perfect form. Now it is clear that those codicils were written by the hand of Acilianus. Although, therefore, they are not confirmed by will, yet they shall be observed by me, just as if they were so con firmed, particularly as there is no opening for an informer.* For if there were cause to fear that what I had made over might be escheated to the public, it would probably be- come me to act with more consideration and caution. Since, however, an heir is at liberty to make a donation of what reverts to him of a heritage, there is nothing to stand in the way of this law of mine, nor are the public laws opposed to it.

It is only seventeen miles distant from town, so that liavimj cot through all you had to do, you can go and stay there with your day's work already secured and disposed of.''' There is access to it by more than one road, for the Laurentine and Ostian highways lead in the same direction ; only, you must branch off from the Laurentine at the fourteenth and the Ostian at the eleventh milestone. Either way, the next part of the road is for some distance sandy, rather heavy and slow-going for a pair, but short and soft for a saddle- horse. The prospect is constantly varying : at one time the road is hemmed in by woods which close in upon you : at another, it stretches through broad pastures and opens out before you : you see numerous flocks of sheep, and troops of horses, and herds of cattle, which are driven down from the hills in winter, and grow sleek on the herbage and in the spring temperature. The house is sufficient in point of accommodation without being expen- sive to keep up. As you enter, there is a vestibule, plain but not mean ; next a hall with columns, rounded in the form of the letter D, enclosing a small but pleasant space, an excellent retreat against stormy weather, being pro- tected by glazed windows and still more by overhanging eaves. Facing the middle of it is a courtyard of cheerful aspect; next, a rather handsome dining-room which projects on to the shore, so that whenever the sea is raised by the south-west wind, it is just wetted by the last spray of the broken waves. It is furnished all round with folding- doors, or windows as large as folding-doors, so that with its sides and its front it faces as it were three different seas. At the back it looks through the courtyard, the hall with the columns, the open space, the haU again, then the vestibule, right to the woods and distant hills. To the left of this, a little way back, is a large saloon, and next * SaJvo jam et composito die is other sense out of the words than variously rendered : but I can get no that given above. to it another smaller one, which admits the morning sun through one window and enjoys the last of the evening sun through another. From this there is a more distant but more sheltered view of the sea below. By the projection of this saloon and the dining-room just mentioned, an angle is formed which holds and intensifies the bright- est sunshine. This is my winter-snuggery, this is also the place of exercise for my household : here every wind is stilled, except such as bring clouds with them, and only drive us from the spot by obscuring the clear sky. In connection with this angle is a saloon with a dome-shaped roof, with windows on all sides so as to follow the circuit of the sun ; in its wall, shelves are inserted, like those of a library, holding books of the kind that are not merely read but studied. Adjoining this is a sleeping-room, with a passage intervening, which is furnished with pipes under- neath so as to circulate and supply the warm air which it collects at a wholesome temperature. The remainder of this wing serves for the accommodation of the slaves and freedmen, most of the rooms being so neat that they might be occupied by my visitors. In the opposite wing there is a tastefully decorated saloon, and next to it what may be called either a large saloon or a moderate-sized dining parlour, which is brightened by a profusion of sunshine and an extensive sea-view : behind this a room with an anteroom, suitable for summer use owing to its height, and for winter from the manner in which it is protected, for it is out of reach of any wind. To this chamber another one with an ante- room is attached by a party-wall. Next comes the cooling room of the bath, spacious and wide, from the opposite walls of which two curved plunging-baths are thrown out, as it were, quite large enough when you remember that the sea is close by.* Adjoining this is the sweating and anointing room, and next to that the passage communicat- ing with the bath-furnace, then two small apartments in BOOK II. 63 an elegant rather than costly style : in continnation is a splendid warm swimming-bath, from which the swimmers have a view of the sea; not far off is the tennis-court, which faces the warmest sun in the afternoon. Here a tower is erected with two sitting-rooms under it, and the same number in it, in addition to a dining-parlour which looks upon a broad expanse of sea and a long line of coast with charming villas. There is also a second tower, and in it a room which enjoys both the rising and setting sun : behind it a spacious storeroom and granary, and below a dining-room, which, when the sea is rough, is exposed only to its roar and its noise, and even that much sub- dued and but faintly heard. It looks upon the garden and the promenade which encloses the garden. This pro- menade is planted round with box, or with rosemary where the box fails ; for box, when protected by buildings, grows freely ; in the open air and exposed to the wind and the spray of the sea, even at a distance, it withers. Next to the promenade, in the inner circle which it forms, is a plantation of young vines, affording shade, and soft and yielding to walk in, even with bare feet. The garden is clothed with a number of mulberry-trees and fig-treestrees which the soil hereabouts is particularly productive of, while it is unfavourable to other kinds. This is the prospect, no less agreeable than that of the sea, which is enjoyed from the dining-room out of sight of the sea. It has at its back two parlours whose windows command the vestibule, and another garden, a productive kitchen one. From this point run out some cloisters, almost important enough for a public construction. There are windows on both sides, but the greater number on that of the sea, those facing the garden being single ones, and fewer by the alternate corresponding windows, which are left out.* * Utrimquefenestrae,amaripJures, siugulae,\" would be clearer. ah horto singulae, scd alternis pauci-seems probable that on the sea-side ores. Kail's conjecture \" Utrimque a line of windows extended along the . . . ab h^rto pauciores, sed alternis whole range of the cloisters : towards When the day is clear and still, all of them can be opened ; when the wind blows on one side or the other, those on the side not exposed to the wind can be left open without inconvenience.* In front of these cloisters is a terrace walk fragrant with violets. The cloisters increase, by their radiation, the warmth of the sun which strikes on them, and in like manner as they hold the sun, they also repel and ward off the north wind ; so that the warmth which they give in front is equalled by the coolness they afford behind. In the same way they arrest the south-west wind, and thus, by means of one or other of their sides, they break the force of, and put an end to, winds coming from the most opposite quarters. These are the advantages of the cloisters in winter ; in summer they are still greater. For before midday they keep cool the terrace walk, and in the after- noon the part of the promenade and the garden nearest them, by their shadow, which, according as the day in- creases or declines, falls longer and shorter on this side or on that. The cloisters themselves, however, are most free from sun when the sun strikes with its fiercest heat directly on their roof. Add to this that through their open windows the west winds are received and transmitted, so that they are never rendered unpleasant by closeness and want of circulation in the air. At the end of the terrace is a chalet, which I am quite in love withyes, literally in love withfor I built it myself. In it there is a sunny apartment which faces the terrace walk on one side and the sea on the other, and on both sides enjoys the sun ; also an apartment with folding- doors which open on the cloisters, and a window towards the sea. In the middle of the M^all there is a very tasteful recess, furnished with a glass partition and curtains, by thegar(len,separate(.S(wr/!(^ae)winclows * When the north wind blew from were inserted in the wall, the blank the garden-side, the windows on that space between them corresponding to side would be shut, and those on the an opposite window on the sea-side. sea-side opened, and vice versa.

Next to this is a sleeping-room for the night, impervious to the voices of the slave-boys, the murmur of the sea, the raging of storms, the flash of the lightning, to the light of day even, unless the windows are oj)ened. The cause of such deep and isolated seclusion is, that an intervening passage separates the wall of the bedroom from that which faces the garden, and so every sound is deadened by this empty space lying between the two. In connection with the sleeping-room is a small heating apparatus, through which the heat underneath is given out or retained, as occasion requires, by means of a little trap-door. Beyond this a bedroom with a dressing-room project towards the sun, catching it as soon as it rises, and retaining its raysthough they fall on it ohliqudyat anyrate, retaining them, till after midday. On betaking myself to this chalet, it seems to me that I have got away even from my own villa, and I derive especial enjoyment from it at the time of the Saturnalia, while the other parts of the establishment are ringing with the license and the mirthful shouts of that season ; for then I am no impediment to the gambols of my servants, nor are they to my studies. Amidst all these conveniences and attractions there is a want of running water ; but there are wells, or rather springs, for they are on the surface. Indeed, the character of this sea-coast is altogether remarkable; at whatever place you turn the soil, an immediate supply of water pre- sents itself, quite pure, and not rendered in the slightest degree brackish by the immediate vicinity of the sea. The neiQ[hbourinCT woods furnish fuel in abundance ; the rest of our supplies the town of Ostia finds us. Indeed, a man of moderate requirements might be sufficiently provided E even at the neighbouring village, which is separated from me by one gentleman's residence only. In this village there are three public baths, a great convenience whenever either an unexpected arrival, or want of time, prevents us from heating the bath at home. The coast is ornamented in the most pleasing variety by villa con- structions, at one place continuous, at another detached, so as to present the appearance of a number of towns, whether you look at them from the sea or the shore itself. This last is often smooth after a long calm, but it is more often hardened by the constant beating of the waves upon it. The sea does not abound in choice fish, it is true, yet it yields excellent soles and lobsters.* My villa, however, furnishes inland produce as well, milk especially ; for the cattle collect here from their pastures, whenever they are in search of water or shade. Now, do I seem to you to have just cause for inhabiting this retreat, for making my home in it, and delighting in it ? You are a perfect cockney if you are not eager to be here. Ah ! and how I wish you were eager, that the charms so great and so numerous of my little villa might be further enhanced to the highest degree by your company ! (i8.) To Mauricus. \"What more agreeable commission could I have received from you than that of looking out for a teacher for your brother's boys ? For, by this kind act of yours, I am sent back to school myself, and am able, as it were, to resume that delightful age of youth.

What he means by this t It was a public teacher, to whose modest word is his reputation for lectures he might send his nephews, oratory, learning, &c. that Mauricus required. Pliny ac- BOOK II. 67 a crowded lecture-room, some of them were talkincj out loud in tlie presence of a number of senators ; * at my entrance they all held their tongues,a circumstance which I should not relate if it did not redound to their credit more than my own, and if I did not wish you to entertain the hope that your nephews may attend the schools with advantage.f For the rest, when I have heard all the professors, you shall have in writing my opinion of each ; and I will try and make youas far, at least, as this can be accomplished in a letterimagine that you yourself have heard them all. This zeal and fidelity I owe to you, and to the memory of your brother, particularly in a matter of such importance. For what can be of greater import to you than that these boys (I would say, of yours, but that now you love them more than if they were your own) should be found worthy of such a father as him, such an uncle as you!an object of solicitude which, even if you had not enjoined it on me, I should have appropriated to myself. Not that I am unaware that many jealousies will have to be incurred by me in this matter of choosing a teacher : however, it is my duty to put up with such jealousies, and even with ill-will, on behalf of your nephews, as readily as parents do on behalf of their ovv^n children. To Cerealis. You advise me to read my speech aloud to a party of friends. I will do so, because you advise it, though I have very strong doubts. One can't forget that speeches, when recited, lose all their spirit and fire, and almost the name of speeches, being productions which are favoured, as well as stimulated, by the assemblage of the judges, the crowd of assistants, the expectation of the issue, the * Grown-up people often attended + Probe disccre, to attend the public the classes of the more eminent lee-lectures with no injury to their manturers. ners, &c. reputation of more than one speaker, and the divided partialities of the audience. Add to this the speaker's gestures, his gait, his shiftings of position even, and the bodily animation corresponding to all the movements of the mind. The consequence is, that those who speak sitting, though they may enjoy in other respects nearly the same advantages as those who stand, yet, from this very circumstance that they are seated, are, as it were, debili- tated and depressed. In the case of those indeed who recite, the chief aids to expression, the eyes and hands, are impeded : hence it is not to be wondered at that the attention of the audience languishes, when charmed from without by none of the graces, and roused by none of the stings of oratory. To this must be added that the oration to which I am referring is of a disputatious and argumen- tative character. Moreover, it is only natural to suppose that what we have written with pains will put the hearer to some pains as well. And, to be sure, how few hearers there are so unprejudiced as not to be pleased rather with those sweet and harmonious periods than with what is dry and concise ? This divergence of taste is truly discredit- able ; yet it exists, since it generally happens that the audi- ence requires one thing and the judges another, whereas, on the contrary, the hearer ought to be particularly affected by that which would move him most of all if he were himself in the position of a judge. Yet it may happen that, in spite of these difficulties, the originality of the work may recommend it : its originality, that is, in our country. The Greeks have a certain mode of treatment, which, though the converse of mine, is not altogether unlike it. For just as it was their custom, when they charged upon a new law that it conflicted with former laws, to establish this charge against it by a comparison of it with others, so in arguing that my contention was supported by the law against extortion, I had to collect this from the law itself, as also from others. This is a mode of treatment which, being anything but agreeable to the ears of the ici;norant, ouoht to obtain all the more favour from those who are instructed, in proportion as it obtains less from those who are not. However, if I decide to recite, I will take care to invite people of learning. But by all means weigh in your mind whether, with all this, there is still ground for reciting : dispose on either side these random reckonings of mine, and choose that to which reason inclines. For a reason is required of you ; as for me, I shall find my excuse in having followed you. (Anon, n.d.) To Calvisius. Get ready your copper, and here is a golden little story for you ; stories ratherfor this new one has reminded me of some older ones, nor does it matter which I choose to start with. Verania, the wife of Piso -I mean the Piso whom Galba adoptedlay seriously ill. Eegulus called upon her. Consider, first, the impudence of the fellow in calling on a sick woman, when he had been the greatest enemy to her husband, and was extremely odious to herself. However, this might pass, if he had called merely. What did he do but actually seat himself close to her bed and interrogate her on the day and hour of her birth ! As soon as he had been informed, he makes up his face, stares out of his eyes, wags his lips, sets his fingers in motion, calculates ; no result ! After keeping the poor lady a long while on the tenter-hooks of expecta- tion, \" You are,\" says he, \" in a critical period ; however, you will escape, and to make you more sure of this, I will consult a soothsayer whom I have frequently employed.\" No sooner said than done ; he goes and offers a sacrifice, and declares that the entrails tally with the prognostics of the stars. With the usual credulity of persons who are in danger, she calls for her tablets and writes down a legacy for Eegulus. Before long she grows worse, crying out with her dying breath upon the roguery and perfidy of the fellow, and his worse than perjury, since he had forsworn himself to her by the life of his own son. Eegulus does this frequently, and no less wickedly, since he is invoking the anger of the gods, whom he himself deceives daily, on the vicarious head of his unfortunate boy. Velleius Blaesus, the wealthy man of consular rank, being at the point of death, was desirous of altering his will. Eegulus, who had lately taken to toady him, hoped for something from a new disposition of property, so h-e began to exhort and to entreat the doctors to prolong by all means in their power the good gentleman's life. As soon as the will was executed, he changed his roh, and reversing his tone, called out to the same doctors, \" How long are you going on tormenting the poor man ? Why grudge an easy death to one on whom you cannot bestow life ? \" Blsesus died, and, as though he had heard every- thing, left not a rap to Eegulus. Will these two stories do for you, or, after the fashion of the schools, do you call for a third ? * Well, I have the materials. Aurelia, a lady of distinction, being about to execute her will, had clothed herself in her handsomest attire.f Eegulus having come to attest it, said, \" I beg you will leave me those clothes of yours.\" Aurelia thought the man was jesting, but he insisted seriously. To make a long story short, he compelled the lady to open her will and to bequeath to him the clothes she had on ; he watched her as she was writing, and looked to see whether she had written the bequest. Aurelia, to be sure, is still alive, though he compelled her to do this, just as though she had been at the point of death. And he gets made heir at one time and receives legacies at another, just as if he deserved it all ! BOOK II. But why put myself to trouble in the case of a city iu which, long since, rogueiy and dishonesty receive no less rewards, indeed greater ones, than honour and virtue ? Look at Kegulus, who from a poor and humble condition has advanced to such great wealth by his misdeeds, that he himself informed me of his consulting the omens as to how soon he should get up to sixty millions of sesterces,* and finding double entrails, which portended that he would become possessed of one hundred and twenty millions. And he will possess that sum too, if only he goes on as he has begun, dictating wills not really their ownthe worst kind of fraud^to the very persons who make them. * About ;^48o,ooo of our money. (lO To Calvisitjs. I DO not know that I have ever spent a more agreeable time than that lately passed by me in the company of Spurinna; so much so, indeed, that there is no man whom I would sooner take for my model in old ageprovided always it be given me to grow oldfor nothing can be better distributed than his mode of life. And for my part, just as the stars with their fixed course, so do the lives of men best please me when they are methodical, and this particularly in the case of old men. In young men a cer- tain confusion as yet, and a certain disorder, so to speak, are not unbecoming : a general repose and regularity are suitable to age, a time when activity is out of date and ambition is discreditable. To this regularity Spurinna most steadfastly adheres ; nay, more, he goes through a round of the following small occupationsthat is, such as would be small if they were not done dailyin a kind of order, and, as it were, orbit. In the early morning he lies on his couch ; at eight o'clock he calls for his shoes ; then he walks three miles, exercising his mind all the time as well as his limbs. If friends are with him, there is conversation of a most elevated kind; if not, a book is read to him, and that, too, sometimes even when there are friends present, provided always it does not inconvenience them. Then he sits down, and there comes a book again, or con- versation in preference to a book. Soon afterwards he steps into his carriage, taking with him his wife, a woman of a remarkable character, or else some one of his friends, as, for BOOK III. 72, instance, lately, myself. What a glorious, what a charming Ute-dj-Ute it is ! How much you learn in it of the old world ! What deeds, what men you hear of ! With what precepts are you imbued ! though he has so tempered his modesty as never to appear to be teaching. Seven miles having been got over in this way, he again walks a mile, and once more sits down, or betakes himself to his sofa and his pen. For he writes lyrical poems with great skill, in Greek, too, as well as in Latin. There is a wonderful sweetness about themâ wonderful flavour and sauciness, and their charm is en- hanced by the purity of the writer's own life. When the hour of the bath is announced (and this is three o'clock in winter, two o'clock in summer), he takes a turn without his clothes in the sun, if there be no wind. \"Then he plays energetically, and for a good while, at tennis ; for this too is a kind of exercise with which he fights against old a<Te. After his bath' he lies down, and puts off dining for a short time. In the interval he has some licrht and amusinfj book read to him. During all this time his friends are at liberty either to do as he does, or, if they prefer it, to occupy themselves in some other way. Dinner is then put on the table, with as much good taste as simplicity, on a service of plain old silver. Vessels of Corinthian brass are in use too. These he delights in without being extrava- gantly addicted to them. The dinner is often accompanied at intervals by the performances of comedians,* that even our bodily pleasures may be seasoned by mental ones. He trenches somewhat upon the night, even in summer ; but no one deems this, tedious, with such courtesy is the entertainment .protracted. From all this it results that, though he has completed his seventy-seventh year, he has the perfect use of his ears and eyes, with a frame active and full of vitality : his sagacity alone he owes to his age. Such is the kind of life which I look forward to on my own account in wish and in tliought, and which I shall enter on with the greatest eagerness so soon as a regard * See Bk. i. Letter 15, These were probably in the nature of \" readings,\" for my advancing years shall permit me to sound the retreat. Meanwhile I am exhausted by a thousand labours, with respect to which this same Spurinna is at once my solace and my example. Por he, too, as long as it became him, served offices, discharged public functions, governed provinces ; and it was by hard work that he became entitled to this repose. I propose, then, to myself the same course as his and the same goal; and now at once enter into an engagement with you to that effect, so that if you should see me carried beyond the mark, you may call me to account on the strength of this letter, and bid me go into retirement when I shall be able to do so without incurring the charge of indolence. (2.) To Maximus. What I should have voluntarily offered your friends, had I the same abundance of opportunities as yourself, I now think myself entitled to ask of you for my friends. Arrianus Maturus is a leading man at Altinum. When I say a leading man, I am not speaking of his means, which are large, but of his piety, his integrity, his respectability, his sagacity. He is one to whose judgment I resort in matters of business, as also to his taste in my literary pursuits, as being so greatly distinguished for his honesty, truthfulness, and intelligence. He loves me (there is no stronger expression) as you do. But he lacks ambition ; consequently he has contented himself with the grade of a knight, though he might with ease rise to the highest rank. It must be my business, however, to see that he is advanced and honoured. It is therefore a great point with me to add somewhat to his position, without his expecting, without his knowing, or perhaps even desiring it ; moreover, to add to it in a way which shall confer lustre with- out entailing trouble on him. The first time you have anything of this description at your disposal, please bestow it on him. You will make him, as well as myself, your grate- ful debtor; for, though not seeking such favours, he receives them with as much gratitude as if he coveted them. (3.) To COEELLIA HiSPULLA. I looked up to and loved (and I know not which was the stronger feeling) that most esteemed and virtuous man your father. And I have a singular regard for you for the sake of his memory, and on your own account. Hence it must necessarily follow that I should desire, and, indeed, as far as in me lies, I shall labour, that your son may turn out like his grandfather. His maternal grandfather would be my choice, though to be sure he has been favoured with one on the father's side who was also a distinguished and approved man. And his father, too, and his paternal uncle were, ,J2ieir of note and of great-reputation. All of whom he will grow up to resemble on one conditionthat he be made to imbibe a liberal education ; and it makes a vast difference from whom in particular he derives this education. As yet his boyish condition has confined him to your family circle ; he has had tutors at home, where there is small opportunity, or even none at all, for going astray. Now, however, his studies must be carried for- ward outside your doors, Now is the time when we must look about for a Latin rhetoric professor of whose scholastic discipline and respectability, above all, of whose morality, we are assured. For our young friend, in addi- tion to all the other gifts of nature and fortune, possesses remarkable personal beauty, in view of which, at his critical age, not a preceptor merely, but a guardian and governor is required. Under these circumstances, I think I can point out to you Julius Genitor, I have a great esteem for him ; yet my regard for the man does not prejudice my judgment, since it is the offspring of my judgment. He is a person of un- blemished respectability, perhaps even a trifle too austere and blunt if we consider the looseness of our asre. As to the value of his eloquence, there are many whose word you may take on that point, for his powers of speech, being evident and on the surface, are immediately perceived. The existence of man, however, conceals deep recesses and huge secret nooks, and on this head you must accept me as sponsor for Genitor. From this individual your son will hear nothing that will not be of advantage to him ; he will learn nothing which it would be better not to have learnt, nor will he be less frequently reminded by Genitor than by you and by me of the ancestral effigies with which he is weighted, of the names, and the great names, he has to maintain. Accordingly, under favour of the gods, entrust him to a preceptor from whom he will learn morals first and afterwards eloquence, which, if morals are Hot taught with it, is learnt to small advantage. (4-) To Macrinus. Though the friends who were by me, and also public report, seem to have approved of what I have done, yet I make a great point of learning your opinion. For as, before acting, I should have wished to seek your advice, so now that the matter is settled, I am particularly anxious to have your judgment on it. During my absence in Tuscany, whither I had made an excursion for the purpose of inaugurating a public work at my own expensehaving obtained leave of absence from my post of praefect of the Treasurysome envoys from the province of Bsetica, who were about to enter a plaint on the subject of the administration of Crecilius Classicus, applied to the Senate to have me for their advocate. My excellent colleagues, full of regard for me, began to talk of the engagements of our common office, and sought to make my excuses and get me off. The Senate passed a decree. BOOK III. 'j'j extremely flattering to me, to the effect that I should be appointed to defend the interests of the provincials, if they should first have obtained my personal consent. The envoys being again introduced, a second time demanded me (who was by this time present) for their advocate, im- ploring my assistance, which they had already enjoyed against Massa Bsebius, and alleging a compact on my part to defend their interests. The Senate received this with the loud applause * which usually preludes their decrees. Upon this I said, \" Conscript Fathers, I cease to think that I have alleged any just grounds for excusing myself.\" The modesty of this speech and the way the thing was put were approved. I was urged, however, to this resolve of mine not merely by the unanimity of the Senatethough this had the greatest weightbut by other consi- derations, which, though of less, were still of some account. It occurred to my mind that our ancestors pursued the wrongs down even to individual friends, and that too by prosecutions voluntarily undertaken ; hence I deemed it all the more disgraceful to neglect the duties imposed by a public connection. Lloreover, when I recollected what were the actual dangers incurred by me on behalf of these same Bistici on the first occasion of my appearing for them, it seemed to me that the value of past obligations would be best preserved by the addition of new ones. Indeed things are so constituted that services of older date are cancelled if you do not heap fresh ones on them. For however often you may have obliged people, yet if you refuse them any one thing, this thing which you have refused is the only one which they will remember. I was further prevailed upon by the fact that Classicus was dead, and the consideration, which is generally the most painful in cases of this kind, removed -I mean the danger run by a senator. Hence I saw as the result of my advocacy no less success than if he had been alive, with the absence of all * Clarissima assensione. Gierig orable to me.\" But the above sense takes clarissima to mean '• most hou-seems to me simpler. odium. To sum up, I reckoned that after discharging this office as much as three times, it would be more easy to ex- cuse myself should any case occur in which it would not be becoming for me to prosecute ; for as there must be some end or other to every kind of function, so ready submission is the best means of preparing the way for a grant of release. You have heard the motives of my resolution. It re- mains to hear your opinion one way or the other ; as to which, plain-spokenness in your dissent will be not less agreeable to me than the authority of your approval ( 50To B^Bius Macer. I am much pleased at your being so diligent a student of my uncle's books that you wish to have them all, and inquire the names of all. I wall fill the part of a cata- logue, and will further inform you of the order in which they were written ; this also being a kind of information not unwelcome to the studious. \" On Cavalry Javelin- Exercise, in one book.\" This he wrote, with as much abi- lity as care, during his campaigns as commander of the allied cavalry. \" The Life of Pomponius Secundus, in two books,\" a man who had cherished a singular regard for him, so that in this work he discharged, as it were, a duty which he owed to the memory of his friend. \" The Ger- man Wars, in twenty books,\" in which he collected all the wars which we have waged with the Germans. This he commenced durmg a campaign in Germany, by admoni- tion of a dream. During his sleep there stood by him the form of Drusus Nero (who, after triumphing far and wide over the Germans, died in their country), commending his memory to my uncle, and entreating the latter to rescue him from unmerited oblivion. \" The Student, in three books,\" divided into six volumes on account of their length, in which the orator is trained from his very cradle and perfected, \" On Doubtful Phraseology, in eight BOOK IIL 79 books.\" He wrote this under Nero, in tlie last years of his reign, when every kind of literary pursuit which was in the least independent or elevated had been rendered dan- gerous by servitude. \" A Continuation of Aufidius Bassus, in thirty-one books.\" \"Natural History, in thirty-seven books,\" a work of great compass and learning, and no less varied than nature itself. You are astonished that a busy man should have com- pleted such a number of volumes, many of them on such intricate subjects ; you will be still more astonished when you learn that for a considerable time he practised at the bar, that he died in his fifty-sixth year, and that between these two periods he was much distracted and hindered, partly by the discharge of important offices, and partly by his intimacy with the emperors. But his was a piercing intellect, an incredible power of application, an extra- ordinary faculty of dispensing wdth sleep. He began to work by candlelight at the feast of Vulcan, not with the view of seizing an auspicious occasion, but for the purpose of study immediately after midnight ; in winter, indeed, at one o'clock in the morning, or at the latest at two, often at midnight.* To be sure sleep came to him very easily, over- taking him at times, or leaving him, even in the midst of his studies. Before daybreak he used to repair to the Emperor Yespasian (who as well as himself worked by night), and after that to his official duties. On his return home, he gave the rest of his time to study. After partaking in the course of the day of a light and digestible t meal in the * The Vulcanalia were on the 23d light on this day, as being a conveof August. \"It was customary on nient date, and so continued them, this day to commence working by As the Romans divided the day- candlelight, which was probably con-light, whether long or short, into sidered as an auspicious beginning of twelve equal hours, and similarly the the use of fire, as the day was sacred night, it is obvious that the hours to the god of this element\" (Diet, (sejitima, octava, &c.) would vary, and G. and R.

Prichard and Bernard(Selected old-fashioned style, he would often in summer, if he had any spare time, lie in the sun, when a book was read to him, of which he made notes and extracts. In- deed, he read nothing without making extracts ; he used even to say that there was no book so bad as not to contain something of value. After his sunning he commonly took a cold bath ; then he lunched * and went to sleep for a very short time. Shortly afterwards, as though he were beginning a fresh day, he studied on till dinnertime. At this meal a book was read out and passing comments made upon it. I remember that one of his friends, on the reader mispronouncing some words, stopped him and made him repeat them, upon which my uncle said, \" Surely you understood him ? \" His friend said, \" Yes.\" \" Why then did you stop him ? We have, lost more than ten verses by this interruption of yours.\" So parsimonious was he of his time. In summer he rose from dinner by daylight; in winter before seven,! as though constrained by some law.' Such was his life in the midst of his avocations and the bustle of the city. In the country, only his bathing-time was exempted from study. When I say bathing, I am speaking of the actual bath inside, for while he was-being rubbed and dried he was read to or dictated. When travelling, as though freed from every other care, he devoted himself to study alone. At his side was a secretary,^w ith a book and tablets, whose hands were protected in winter by gloves, so that not even the rigour of the season might rob my uncle of any time for study ; for which reason, in Eome, too, he used to be carried in a sedam I remember being reproved by him for taking a walk. \" You might,\" Letters of Pliny) take it as \"simple, served this term in their \"'gofiter\" easy to be got, not dear,\" quoting Pe-which, if we take cena as \"supper,\" tronius 93.

By dint of this intense application he completed all those numerous volumes, and left me one hundred and sixty books of \" selections,\" written on both sides of the parch- ment and in an extremely small hand, which makes their number really much larger. He used to relate himself that when he was procurator in Spain he might have sold these books to Lar^ius Licinus for four hundred thousand sesterces,* and at that time there were rather fewer of them. Does it not seem to you, when you recollect how much he read and how much he wrote, that he could never have been engaged in any public offices or in attendance on the sovereign ? And, on the other hand, when you hear how laboriously he toiled at his studies, w^ould you not think that he neither wrote nor read enough ? For what is there that would not be impeded by such occupa- tions as his ? On the other hand, what is there that could not be accomplished by such unflagging industry ? Hence I am in the habit of laughing when some folks call me studious, who if compared with him am the idlest of the idle. / only, do I say, distracted as I am partly by public calls, partly by those of friendship ?

I have extended my letter, though proposing originally to give you the required information only, the names of the books he had left behind. Yet I am confident that all this additional matter will prove as acceptable to you as the books themselves, since it may incite you, by the stimulus of emulation, not merely to read them, but to elaborate something of the same kind yourself. * About ;^3200. To Annius Severus, Out of a legacy that fell to me I bouglit lately a figure of Corinthian brass, which, though small, is spirited and bold, as far as my taste goes ; which taste, perhaps, in all matters, and assuredly in this one, is of infinitesimal value. However, this is a figure which even / can appreciate ; for it is nude, so that its defects, if it has any, are not concealed, and its merits are fully brought to view. It repre- sents an old man standing : bones, muscles, sinews, veins, wrinkles even, appear as of one breathing, the hair is scanty and retreating from the brow, the forehead broad, the face shrivelled, the neck thin, the arms droop, the breasts are flat, the belly is drawn in. The back exhibits the same age, as far as a back can. The brass itself, to judge from its colour, which is of the right sort, must be antique. In short, everything about it is of a character to arrest the eyes of an artist, as well as to delight those who are not connoisseurs. And this it was Avhich tempted such a tyro as myself to the purchase. /However, I have bought it, not to place in my house (where up to this time I have never had anything in the way of Corinthian brasses), but for the purpose of setting it up in my native parts in some frequented place, and for preference in the temple of Jupiterj, for it seems an offering worthy of a temple and worthy of a god. Will you, then, with your usual attention to my commissions, undertake to see to this, and at once order a pedestal to be made, of any kind of marble you please, to contain my name and titles, if you think the latter should be added ? I will send you the figure itself as soon as 1 can find some one who will not be incommoded by it, or (which you would prefer) will bring it with me in person.

News has lately come of Silius Italicus having put an end to his life by starvation, at his place near Naples. The incentive to death was the state of his health. An incurable swelling had appeared on his person, wearied with which he hastened to die, with a resolution not to be diverted from its purpose. He was blessed by fortune and happy down to his last day, except that he lost the younger of his two children ; yet the elder and the better of the two he left behind him in prosperous circumstances, indeed in the position of a consular.* He had injured his reputation under Nero, when he was believed to have played the accuser officiously ; but, as a friend of Vitellius, he had conducted himself wisely and in a popular way. He had brought back with him great repute from his ad- ministration of Asia, and had effaced the stain of his old industry t hy a life of laudable repose. He was among the chief men of the state, possessing no power and arous- ing no hostility. He had many visitors and much atten- tion shown him ; and, reclining a good deal on a couch in his apartmentalways a resort for company, though not from regard to his fortunes jhe passed the days in learned discourse, when he had leisure from writing. He wrote poems with more pains than genius, and occasionally tested the taste of the public by reciting them.

The French \" indus-visited for his own sake, not courted trie\" exactly renders this, for which as a man possessing great power, for we have no exact word in English : he had none. end, influenced by his years, he retired from Eome and confined himself to Campania, nor was he drawn thence even by the accession of a new emperor. Great credit is due to Caesar, under whom it was free to hifn to act tlms, and to liim also for daring to profit by this freedom.* l^e was a coUector.t to such an extent as to be chargeable with a mania for buying. He had several villas in the same places, and, as soon as he had conceived an affection for the new ones, used to neglect the old. He had every- where a quantity of books and statues and busts, which last he not only possessed but actually worshipped, that of Virgil above all others, whose birthday he used to cele- brate more religiously than his own, particularly at Naples, where he was wont to repair to his tomb as to a temple. In this condition of repose he outlived his seventy-fifth year, being of a delicate rather than an infirm constitu- tion. As he was the last consul made by Nero, so he was the last to die of all those whom Nero had made consuls. And this, too, is remarkable : the last to die of Nero's consuls was the man in whose consvilship Nero himself perished. When recalling this, I am seized with pity for the transient condition of humanity. For what can be so circumscribed, so short, as the life of man at its longest ? Does it not seem to you as if Nero had existed quite lately ? And yet, in the interval, of those who filled the consulship under him, not one is now remaining. Yet why be surprised at this ? L. Piso (father of the Piso who was slain in Africa by the atrocious act of Valerius Pestus) used to say lately that he saw no one in the senate to whom, during his own consulship, he had put the ques- tion from the chair. By such narrow bounds is the exist- ence of such a multitude J compassed, that, to my mind, those royal tears we have heard of deserve not only for- * It was the etiquette for a man in X The senate at this time appears his position to proceed to Rome and to liave contained about six hundred pay his respects to the new emperor, members. f ^CKoKoKos, lit., \" a lover of beau- tiful objects.\" BOOK III. giveness but even commendation. For they say that Xerxes, when he had cast his eyes over his immense army, wept at the thought that so speedy an end awaited so many thousands. But so much the rather, with regard to this our portion, whatever it may be, of poor fleeting time, if we do not allot it to deeds (for the opportunity for these is in other hands than ours *), let us at any rate prolong it by our studies. And inasmuch as length of life is denied us, let us leave something behind to prove that we have lived. I know you require no stimulus. Yet my regard for you causes me to prick you on, even when you are going your best pace, just as you do to me. 'Tis a goodly strife when friends, with mutual exhortations, take their turn at inciting each other to a love of immortality. (8.) To Suetonius Tranquillus. You are acting agreeably to the respect which you always show me, in asking me so earnestly to transfer the tribuneship,t obtained by me for you, from that distin- guished man Neratius Marcellus, to your kinsman Cte- sennius Silvanus. For my part, as it would have been extremely agreeable to me to see you a tribune, so it will be not less pleasing to see another in that position through your instrumentality. Indeed, it would not, as I think, be consistent to wish to advance a man in honour, and yet to deny him the glory to be derived from the exercise of affection, a glory which is nobler than all hon- ours. I perceive, too, that, admirable as it is to deserve favours as well as to bestow them, you will achieve both kinds of credit at one and the same time, by handing over to another what you yourself have merited. Moreover, I observe that it will redound to my glory as well, if, by this action of yours, it shall become known that my friends can not only be invested with tribuneships, but even * In the hands of the gods. + A military tribuneship. PUNY 'S LETTERS. give them away. So for my part I conform to this most laudable desire of yours. And to be sure your appoint- ment is not yet confirmed, so that it is in my power to substitute the name of Silvanus for yours ; and I hope your favour will be as agreeable to him as mine is to you. (9-) To Cornelius Minicianus. I can now write you in full of the great exertions under- gone by me in the state trial instituted by the province of Baetica; for it involved many points and required fre- , quent pleadings, presenting much variety. Whence this variety ? Whence these numerous pleadings ? Csecilius Classicus, a detestable man, practising no concealment in his guilt, discharged the proconsulship in that province, with as much lawlessness as low avarice, the same year that Marius Prisons was in Africa. Now Prisons came from Bcetica, and Classicus from Africa. Hence a saying of the Baitici, and one not devoid of humour, was in circulationfor misery, too, will sometimes make people witty - \" I have bestowed one plague, and received an-,f, other.\" But Marius was accused by only one city puwcty, *^^' \\ and by a number of private individuals ; whereas Classicus was attacked by a whole province. The prosecution was anticipated by his death, which was either casual or the result , of his own act ; for though it was unfavourably spoken of it remained a matter of doubt. Indeed, while it seemed likely that he should have wished to lay down his life since he could offer no defence, it seemed equally strange that a man should, by death, have escaped the shame of being condemned, who had felt no shame in com- mitting actions worthy of condemnation. None the less did the Bsetici persist in accusing him, even after he was deceased. There was a legal provision to this effect, though it had fallen into disuse, and after a long interval it was again applied in this case. They went still further, BOOK III. and included in the accusation the accomplices and agents of Classicus, demanding an inquiry into their conduct and giving their names. I appeared for the Bsetici, and with me was Lucceius Albinus, a fluent and graceful speaker, a man for whom I had long felt a regard that was mutual, and towards whom, owing to our association in this affair, I have begun to cherish an ardent affection. Glory carries with it, espe- cially in mental pursuits, a certain \" unsociableness ; \" * yet between us there was no conflict, no contention, each exerting himself as an equal yoke-fellow, not on his own behalf, but on that of the cause, whose importance and interests seemed to demand that we should not take upon us to deal with so weighty a matter in a single speech a-piece. We feared that daylight, that our voices, that our strength might fail us, if we tied up so many charges, so many accused persons, in one bundle as it were. Further, that the attention of the judges might be not only weakened but' actually confused by the multitude of names and cases. Again, that the interests possessed by individuals, when thus conjoined in a lump, might lead to each indi- vidual obtaining the advantage of the whole. Lastly, that the most influential personages, by offering up the meanest of the lot as a kind of scapegoat, might slip off under cover of other folks' punishment. For assuredly favour and in- trigue are most certairi to prevail when they can shelter themselves under a specious appearance of severity. We remembered the example given by Sertorius, who ordered the strongest and the weakest soldier to pull at the tail of a horseyou know the rest ; for we, too, saw that so numerous an array of accused could only be got the better of, on condition of being attacked singly. We determined to start with proving the guilt of Classicus himself ; from this the transition was most natural to his accomplices and agents, since they could not be proved to be such, unless he, were guilty. Of this * ^AkOIVUV7]TOV, number, we at once tacked on two to Classicns, Bsebins Probus and Fabius Hispanus, both strong men in point of interest, Hispanus also in point of eloquence. As to Classicus, indeed, our work was short and easy. He had left in writings under his own hand, what he had received from every transaction and from every cause ; he had even ^jj^v sent letters to Eome'to a certain mistress of his, boasting and bragging in these very words, \" Hurrah ! hurrah ! I come to you a free * man, having already realised four millions of sesterces,t by a sale of a portion of the Bsetici.\"! With regard to. Hispanus and Probus, we had a great deal of trouble. Before entering upon their crimes, I thought it necessary to labour the point of demonstrating that agency \"was a criminal offence, since if I had not estab- lished this it w.ould have been useless to prove that they were agents ; for, the defence set up for them was, not a denial of the charges, but a plea for allowance on the ground of compulsion. They were provincials, they said, and were compelled by fear to obey all the proconsul's orders. Claudius Eestitutus, who replied to me, a prac- ticed and wary advocate, and one who is prepared for every emergency, however unexpected, constantly says that never in his life was he so mystified and perplexed as when he saw his defence forestalled and robbed of the very points on which he placed all his reliance. The result of our joint conduct of the case was this : the senate decided that the property possessed by Classicus, before going to his province, should be separated from the remainder and be handed over to his daughter ; the rest to go to those who had been despoiled. It was further added that the monies he had paid his creditors should be refunded by them. His- panus and Probus were banished for five years. So serious did those crimes of theirs appear, about which at the outset doubts were entertained whether they were crimes at all. BOOK III. After a few days, we put in accusation Cluvius Fuscus, a son-in-law of Classicus, and Stilonius Prisons, who had been tribune of a cohort under Classicus, with different results, Priscus being banished * from Italy for two years, and Puscus acqiiitted. In our third suit, we thought it the most convenient course to proceed against several persons collectively, lest, if the inquiry were further pro- tracted, the impartiality and strictness of the judges might become relaxed through satiety and disgust as it were. And, besides, there remained certain less important defen- dants who had been expressly reserved for this stage, with the exception, however, of Classicus's wife, as to whom, though she was involved in suspicions, yet it was thought there were not enough proofs to convict her. Por with regard to Classicus's daughter, who was also among the defendants, not even suspicions attached to her. So on coming to her name in the last suit (for towards the end of the proceedings we had not to fear, as we should have done at the beginning, that such a course might weaken the force of the entire accusation), I deemed it the most honourable plan not to press on an innocent person, and I said this frankly and in various ways. On one occasion I asked the agents of the province whether they could furnish me with any instructions such as they were confident could be confirmed by proofs; another time I re- quested the advice of the senate whether, supposing me to possess some powers of oratory, they were of opinion that I ought to aim a kind of weapon, so to speak, at the throat of an innocent person. In the end, I summed up the whole subject in these concluding words : \" Some one will perhaps say, ' Do you, then, constitute yourself a judge ? ' I, indeed, am not judging ; but I remember that I was assigned as an advocate from among those who are judges.\" The end of this cause, to which so many persons were parties, was that some were acquitted, and a greater number convicted and further banished, either for a term or for life. By the same decree of the senate, onr assiduity and- integrity and intrepidity were attested with the fullest acknowledgments, a meet reward of our great exertions, and the only one that could compensate for them. You can imagine how tired we are, after having had to speak so often, and so often to altercate,* to interrogate, to come to the rescue of, to refute such a number of witnesses. Then see how difficult and jtroublesome it was merely to turn a deaf ear to the private solicitations of the defendants' friends, and to bear up against their open opposition. I will just relate one thing of those I said. On one of the judges interrupting me with a reclamation on behalf of a defendant, who enjoyed great interest, \" The man,\" said I, \" will be none the less innocent if I say all I have to say.\" t You will conjecture from this what controversies, what angry feelings even, we had to put up with, at any rate for a short time. For integrity, though at the actual time it offends those to whose wishes it is opposed, yet in the sequel is honoured and praised by these identical people, I have introduced you to the scene to the best of my ability. You will say, \" It was not worth while. What have I to do with such a long letter?\" Well, then, don't you keep asking what is going on in. Eome. And yet remember that a letter is not a long one which embraces so many days and trials, so many defendants in short, and so many cases ; all of which I fancy I have set forth as concisely as carefully. Yet I was hasty in saying \" carefully ; \" something occurs to me which I had passed over, and that, too, somewhat late. Nevertheless, though out * We have no word for altercor. f This is taken in two ways. \"The \"To strive to gain the victory over an man is sure not to be convicted, what- opponent in a court of justice by put-ever I may say,\" or, \" If the man is ting questions for him to answer \" really innocent, my telling my story (Riddle and White).

However, I do not see we have a specimen of it in Cicero ad why Pliny may not have had both Att., i. 16. meanings in his mind. BOOK III. of its order, you shall have it. Homer does this kind of thing, and a good many others on the strength of his ex- ample, and it is mighty graceful in other ways. However, it is not on these accounts that I do it. One of the witnesses, either angry at having been sub- pcena'd against his will, or else suborned by one or other of the defendants with the view of disarming the accusa- tion, impeached Norbanus Licinianus, an agent of the j)rovince and solicitor for the prosecution, on a charge of collusion in the case of Casta (this was the wife of Classicus). It is a maxim of our law that the case of the person on trial shall first be completed, and then the ques- tion of collusion be inquired into ; evidently because the honesty of a prosecutor is best judged of from the course of the prosecution itself. In the instance of Norbanus, however, neither the order prescribed by law, nor the name of agent and office of solicitor, were any protection to him : such a blaze of odium enveloped the man, who, be- sides being otherwise infamous, had made his profit, as many did,, out of Domitian's times, and who had been selected onjiihis occasion by the province as their solicitor, not for his .respectability and integrity, but for his enmity to Classicus, by whom he had been banished. He requested t<;jf^fcave a day named for the inquiry, and that the charges a^nst him should be formulated ; but he obtained neither request, and was compelled to reply on the spot. He did reply,the bad, vicious character of the man makes me doubt whether I should say with impudence, or with firmness, certainly with great readiness. Many charges were brought against him which did him more harm than that of collusion. Moreover, two men of consular rank, Pomponius Eufus and Libo Frugi, damaged him by their evidence to the effect that he had assisted the accusers of Salvius Liberalis in open court in Domitian's time. He was found guilty and banished to an island. So, when I came to prosecute Casta, there was no point which I pressed more than this one, that her accuser had been con-victed of collusion. However, I pressed it to no purpose, for a result followed which was self-contradictory and novel ; the accuser having been found guilty of collusion, the defendant was acquitted. You ask what we did during this affair of Norbanus.* We submitted to the senate that we had been instructed by him in the matter of the state trial, and that we ought to be furnished with an entirely fresh set of instructions if he were proved to have acted in collusion ; accordingly, while his case was being proceeded with, we remained in our seats. After this, Norbanus was present each day at the principal trial and persevered with the same resolution, or else im- pudence, to the very end. I ask myself whether I have again omitted anything, and again an omission has nearly occurred. On the last day, Salvius Liberalis strongly inveighed against the re- maining agents, on the ground that they had not brought to trial all those whom the province had charged them to prosecute ; and by his usual force and eloquence he in- volved them in some risk. I came to the aid of these men, who are not only very worthy but also very grateful persons ; at any rate they say publicly that they owe their escape from such a storm to me. This shall be the end of my epistle, really and truly the end. I won't add a single letter, even though I should still feel that something has been passed over. (lO.) To Vestricius Spurinna and Cottia. I did not tell you, during my recent visit to you, that I had composed something on your son : first of all, because I had not written with the object of mentioning it, but with that of satisfying my affection and my grief ; and * Dum, haec aguntur, evidently the prosecution of Casta has been inrefer to the episode of Norbanus. serted imrenthetically and in antici-What he haa said about his course on patiou. BOOK in. 93 next, because I believed that you, Spurinna, when you had heard of my reciting (as you yourself told me was the case) had heard at the same time what was the subject of my recitation. Besides, I feared to upset you, in the midst of festal days, by leading you back to a remem- brance of your poignant sorrow. Even now, there is some hesitation on my part whether to forward you, at your particular request, that portion only which was recited by me, or to ad,d to it what I meditate reserving for a fresh volume. It does not, I must tell you, suffice to my affec- tion to do honour to a memory so beloved and so sacred in a single poor book ; it would be more to the interest of his fame that it should be distributed and made the subject of several compositions. However, in this my hesita- tion whether to send you all that I have already composed, or as yet to withhold a portion, it seemed the franker and more friendly course to send all, particularly as you assure me that you will keep it to yourselves till I have decided about publishing. It remains for me to ask you, in case you think any additions, changes, or omissions should be made, to indicate them to me with a like frankness. It is difficult, I know, to put such a strain on the mind in the midst of sorrow,very difficult. Yet, just as you would advise a sculptor or a painter, who should be producing a likeness of your son, of the points to be brought out or altered, so. I pray you. to direct and guide me, who am striving to execute no mere fragile and fleeting portrait, but (as you suppose) an imperishable oneone which at any rate will live the longer, the truer, the better, the more finished it is. (II.) To Julius Genitok. Our dear Artemidorus is altogether of such a kindly nature that he exaggerates the services of his friends. Hence, among others, a favour done him by myself is circulated by him with encomiums which, though genuine, are above its value. To be sure, after the banishment of the philosophers from Eome,* I went to see him at his house in the suburbs, and what made the thing more subject to remark, in other words more dangerous, was the fact that I was praetor at the time. Moreover, I advanced to him without interest (though I had to borrow it myself) a considerable sum of money, which he required for the purpose of discharging debts contracted by him under the most honourable circumstanceswhile some of his great and wealthy friends were hemming and hawing over it. And this I did when seven of my friends had been either put to death or banished -Senecio, Eusticus and Helvidius had been put to death ; Mauricus, Gratilla, Arria and Fannia had been banishedand when scorched, as it were, by so many thunderbolts falling around me, I augured from certain sure signs that the same destruction was impend- ing over myself. Yet I do not on this account consider that I deserved any extraordinary credit, as he sets forth, but simply that I avoided disgracing myself; for not only did C. Musonius, his father-in-law, inspire me with a regard mingled with admiration {as far as difference of ages permitted), but this very Artemidorus was cherished by me in the closest bonds of friendship, as long ago as when I was soldiering in Syria, in the capacity of tribune. And the first token of some good natural disposition that I showed was the fact that I was seen to appreciate a man, who was either a sage or else approximated to and closely resembled one ; for of all those who now-a-days style themselves philosophers, you will hardly find here and there one so thoroughly honest and genuine. I say nothing of the bodily endurance with which he bears the cold of winter equally with the heat of summer, or of how he recoils before no exertions, how neither in his food nor in his drink does he allow any part to sensual enjoyment, how he is master of his eyes and his emotions. Great * By Domitian. qualities these : in any other man, that is to say : in his case, of small account, if they bo compared with his other virtues, which were such as to merit his being chosen by C. Musonius as his son-in-law in preference to various suitors of various ranks. \"When I recall these things, it is certainly gratifying to me that he heaps such praises on me in your hearing and that of others ; yet' I fear he will exceed the mark, which his kindly nature (I return, you see, to my starting-point) does not in general confine itself to. For though in other respects a most sagacious man, there is just one mistake that he falls into^^an honourable one, still a mistake : he values his friends more highly than they deserve. (12.) To Catilius Seveeus. I will come to your dinner, but must start with bar- gaining that it be a shor^i and homely one, abounding in Socratic discourses only, and even as to them preserving a mean. There will be callers abroad before daylight,* such as even Cato could not stumble on with impunity, albeit C. Csesar censures him in such a way as to praise him. For he relates how those whom Cato encountered, when they had uncovered his tipsy head, blushed, adding, \" You would think, noit that Cato had been caught in the act by them, but they by Cato.\" What greater estima- tion could be accorded him than to think him so venerable even in his cups. However, in our dinner let a limit of time be observed, as well as of service and expense. (13-) To VOCONIUS EOMANUS. I forward you, at your particular request, the speech in which I lately returned thanks to our excellent prince, in my capacity of consul. I should have forwarded it just the same, if you had not made the request. With regard to this production, pray consider not only the pleasing character of the subject, but also its difficulties. For, while in the case of other subjects, their very novelty keeps the reader attentive ; as to this one, everything has been made known, published, said over and over again. The consequence is that the reader, grown in a manner indolent and careless, is free to attend to the mode of ex- pression only, a point in which it is very difficult to give satisfaction, when it is the only one that is made the subject of criticism. And I would that the arrangement at least, and the transitions and the figures of speech, were equally attended to ; for brilliancy of invention and grandeur of diction are to be found sometimes even among the untutored; whereas harmony in arrangement and variety in ornamentation are in the power of the learned only. Nor indeed is a high and lofty tone always to be aimed at : just as, in a picture, nothing so much sets off\" light as shade ; so it is proper to lower as well as to raise the tone of an oration. But why all this to a man of your learning ? Eather let me say this : note what you think ought to be corrected ; for I shall be the more ready to think that you like the other parts, on being informed that there are some parts which you dislike. (14.) To AciLius. An atrocious business thisand one deservincr a better record than a mere letterthe treatment which Largius I BOOK III. Macedo, a man of praetorian rank, has suffered at the hands of his slaves. He was in general a haughty and cruel master, and one who did not sufficiently remember that his own father had been in a servile condition, or rather who remembered it too well. He was bathing at his villa near Formiae, when all of a sudden his slaves surrounded him : one sprang at his throat, another struck him on the face, a third inflicted blows on his chest and belly, and even, horrible to relate, on other parts of his frame. When they thought the breath was out of him, they threw him on the hot pavement, to ascertain whether he was still alive. On seeing him extended without motioneither because he was really senseless, or else pretended to be sothey were satisfied that they had done for him. Then, at last, they carried him out, under pretence that he had been suffocated by the heat. His more confidential servants received the body, and his mistresses ran up with wailings and shrieks. Whereupon, roused by the sound of voices, and refreshed by the coolness of the place, he showed that he was alivehe could do it safely now -by opening his eyes and by the movements of his body. The slaves fled, of whom the greater number have been arrested, and the re- mainder are being searched for. He himself, having been nursed with difficulty for some days, died, not without the satisfaction of seeing them punished, for he was avenged during his lifetime as persons usually are after they have been slain. You see to what a number of dangers and affronts and mockeries we are exposed ; nor has any one reason to feel secure on the ground of being easy-going and indulgent, for masters are assassinated, not upon a judgment of their conduct, but from sheer wickedness. However, so much for this. What is there further in the way of news ? What ? Why nothing, else I would add it ; for there is still room left on my paper, and moreover to-day, being a holiday, would allow of my stringing together more matter, I will just add what opportunely occurs to me in relation G to this same Macedo. As he was once bathing at the public baths in Eome, a remarkable, and indeed, as the event showed, ominous circumstance occurred to him. A Roman knight, whom Macedo's slave had requested, by a slight touch of the hand, to allow him to pass, turned round and struck with his open palm, not the slave by whom he had been touched, but Macedo himself, with such force that he nearly knocked him down. So the bath, as it were, by a kind of gradation, was first a scene of affront and after- wards of death to him. (IS.) To SiLius Proculus. You ask me to read your short productions in the retirement of the country, and to examine whether they are worth publishing. You employ prayers and you allege an authority ; for while you beg me to subtract some odd hours from my literary pursuits and bestow them on yours, you add that M. TuUius * was wonderfully kind in encou- raging poetical dispositions. But neitl^er prayers nor ex- hortations are required by me. Not only do I entertain a most religious veneration for the poetic art itself, but also a very strong regard for you. What you desire, then, shall be done, with as much diligence as good will. Even now I think I may write back that your work is pleasing, and one that should not be suppressed, as far as it was possible to judge by the portions of it which you recited in my presence ; that is to say, if your recitation did not impose on me, for you read in a most charming and ac- complished way. Yet I am confident of not being so led by the ears as that all the sharpness of my judgment is deadened by what captivates thmi. It may possibly be V>lunted and a trifle dulled, yet it can't be altogether era- dRatea and ')s^f^^1?ea'^rom me. So I can pronounce, even * Cicero. BOOK III. 99 now, without rashness on your production as a whole ; as to the parts I will judge of them by a perusal of them. (i6.) To Nepos. I seem to have observed, with regard to the actions and utterances of distinguished men and women, that the most famous are not always the greatest.* This opinion of mine has been confirmed by what I heard from Fannia yesterday. The lady is a granddaughter of the celebrated Arria, who was not only the solace of her husband in death, but herself set him the example of dying. She related many traits of her grandmother, not inferior to this action, though less known ; and I am of opinion that they will appear as admirable to you when you read of them as they did to me on hearing of them. Csecina Psetus, her husband, lay sick, and her son lay sick too, both of them, as it seemed, to the death. The son died, a youth of remarkable beauty, and as modest as he was beautiful, one not less endeared to his parents by other considerations, than by the fact of his being their son. She made arrangements for his funeral, and con- ducted his obsequies in such a way that her husband knew nothing of the matter. Nay more, whenever she entered his bed-room, she pretended that their son still lived, and even that he was somewhat easier, and upon his frequently inquiring what the boy was doing she would answer, \" He has had a good sleep. He has taken food with appetite.\" After ^this, as her tears, long restrained, were getting the better of her and breaking forth, she would leave the room. Then she abandoned herself to her grief. When she had -^vept her full she would return, her eyes dried, her features composed, as though she had left * A lia clariora esse alia majora, literally, \" that some are more celebrated and others greater.\" her condition of bereavement outside the door. Glorious, indeed, was tlie conduct of tliis same lady when she drew the steel and plunged it into her bosom and, extracting the dagger and handing it to her husband, added those immortal and well-nigh divine words, \" Paetus, it gives no pain ! \" And yet, when she acted and spoke thus, glory and enduring fame were before her eyes. How much nobler a thing it was, with no prize of enduring fame or of glory in view, to hide her tears, to veil her grief, to go on playing the part of mother when her son was gone ! Scribonianus had taken up arms against Claudius in Illyricum. Psetus had sided with him, and (Scribonianus having been killed) was being dragged a prisoner to Eome. He was about to embark on board ship, when Arria en- treated the soldiers that she might be allowed to embark with him. \" Surely,\" said she, \" you are going to allow a man of consular rank some servant-lads to hand him his food, to help him on with his clothes and his shoes ! / will do everything for him single-handed.\" Failing to obtain her request, she hired a fishing-smack, and followed the huge vessel in her tiny craft. The same lady said to the wife of Scribonianus, who had turned informer, upon the hearing before Claudius, \" Can I listen to you when Scribonianus was killed on your bosom, and yet you live ! \" from which it is plain that the design of her glorious death was no sudden one. More than this, when Thrasea, her son-in-law, adjured her not to persist in putting an end to her life, and among other things said, \" Is it your wish, then, that your daugh- ter, if ever I should be compelled to die, should die with me ? \" she replied, \" If she shall have lived as long and as united a life with you, as I with Paetus, it is my wish.\" This reply increased the anxiety of her friends, and she was watched more closely than before. Perceiving this, \" You are wasting your time,\" said she ; \" you can, indeed, bring it to pass that I shall die with difficulty, but not that I shall fail to die.\" In the act of speaking, she BOOK III. loi sprang from her seat and struck her head with great force full against the opposite wall, falling to the ground. \" I told you,\" said she, when she had been brought round by treat- ment, \" that I should find some way, however hard, to death, if you denied me an easy one.\" Do not these things seem to you grander than the celebrated \" Psetus, it gives no pain ! \" for which they prepared the way ? And yet, for all that, one action enjoys great celebrity, and the others none at all. Hence may be gathered, as I started by say- ing, that what is most famous is not always the greatest. (17.) To Servianus. Can all be well, that your letters have ceased for some time past ? Or perhaps all is well, but you are busy ? Or you are not busy, but you have few or no opportunities of communicating with me ? Eelieve me of this uneasiness which is too much for me : pray relieve me of it, even at the cost of sending a special messenger. I will pay him his expenses and make him a present into the bargain, provided only he brings me the news I long for. For my- self, I am well, if one can be said to be well who lives in suspense and anxiety, hourly expecting and dreading on the account of his loved friend every possible accident which can befall man. (i8.) To CuRius Severus. My office of consul imposed on me the duty of con- gratulating the Emperor in the name of the State. Hav- ing done this, according to custom, in the Senate, in a way suitable to the time and place, I deemed it most agreeable to the part of a good citizen, to embrace the same subject at greater length, and with a fuller treatment, in a published volume : firstly, that our Emperor might be I02 PLINY'S LETTERS. gratified by the exhibition of his own virtues set forth with genuine praises ; secondly, that future princes might be admonished beforehandnot in schoolmaster fashion, but at least by an exampleof the best road for attaining to the same renown. For to teach what a prince ought to be, though to be sure a noble work, is at the same time an arduous and almost a presumptuous one. Whereas, to praise an admirable prince, and in this way to exhibit to posterity a light, so to speak, from a beacon, such as it may followthis course has the same advantages as the other, without any air of assumption. Again, it was no small pleasure to me that when I desired to read this book to my friends, and had bidden them, not by formal cards or handbills, but simply, \" if it were convenient,\" \"if they had plenty of time to spare,\" (and never, in Eome, do people have plenty of spare time, or is it convenient to them to listen to a reading), yet they assembled, in the worst possible weather too, for two consecvitive days, and when my modesty was for bringing the reading to an end, insisted on my adding a third day. Am I to suppose that this honour was paid to me, or to letters ? To letters, I am sure, which once nearly extinct, are now being warmed into life again. But look at the subject to which they paid such devoted attention ! Why, it was one which, in the Senate itself, where we were obliged to put up with it, nevertheless used to weary us even in the shortest space of time ; yet now persons are found ready to read out and to listen to this same subject for three whole days, not because it is treated with more eloquence than formerly, but because it is treated with greater freedom and consequently with greater heartiness. This then must be added to the praises of our Prince, that a business which was once as hateful as it was untruthful * has become as agreeable as it is genuine. I must say, however, that I was wonderfully pleased not only with the attention of my audience, but also with * He alludes in this, and what has preceded, to the bad days of Domitian. BOOK TIL 103 their taste. For I noticed that the gravest passages were those which were most highly approved by them. I am of course aware that I recited to a small mimber of persons only, what had been written for the general public. None the less, for all that, and just as though the opinion of the public is sure to be the same, I am rejoiced at this severity of taste in the listener, and just as theatrical audiences used to teach the musicians to play badly, so now I am induced to hope that possibly these same audiences may teach them to play well* For all who write to please will write what they see docs please. As to myself, how- ever, I am confident that, in this particular kind of subject, I am justified in employing a somewhat lively style, inas- much as those portions which are plain and devoid of colouring, rather than those which have been penned with gaiety and a certain exuberance, might seem foreign to, and out of keeping with it. Yet none the less earnestly do I pray that there may be a time somewhen (and I hope it may have come already), when the sugared and flatter- ing style will be driven even from ground to which it may seem fairly entitled, in favour of what is serious and severe. You have my doings for three days : I wished you to hear of them, and thus to receive the same pleasure in your absenceboth on account of letters generally and myself personallyas you might have enjoyed had you been present. (19.) To Calvisius Rufus. I call you as usual into council on my private affairs. Certain farms are for sale, which adjoin my estate and in- deed run into it. In these there are many points which attract me, and some of no less importance which repel me. What attracts me is, first of all, that it would be a * This is said figuratively. The reference is still to written compositions and recitations. fine thing in itself to join the two properties, next that it would be a source of advantage no less than of pleasure to be able to visit both of them at the same time and at the expense of one journey, to place them under the same stewards, one may almost say under the same overseers, and while inhabiting and embellishing one house, merely to have to keep the other one in repair. As elements in .this calculation there are the cost of furniture, the charges of head-servants, gardeners, workmen, and hunting equi- page as well : since it makes a great difference whether these objects are collected in one spot or dispersed about in various places. On the other hand, I fear it may be imprudent to expose such an amount of property to the same climate and the same casualties. It seems safer to test the mutability of fortune by varying the situation of one's possessions. Besides, there is much that is agreeable in the chancre of scene and of climate, and in the mere travelling about from one property to another. Now the chief point on which I am deliberating is this ; the lands are fertile, rich and well-watered, they consist of meadows, vineyards, and woods which furnish timber, and_Jience a revenue which, though moderate in amount, is sure.* But this fruitfulness of the soil is deteriorated by the poverty of those who cultivate it. For the former owner used often to distrain on the tenant's stock, and while dimi- nishing for a time the arrears due from his farmers, he drained them of their resources for the future, and owing to the failure of these, the arrears grew up again. Hence these people must be furnished with slaves, who will cost all the more because they must be honest ones. For as to slaves in chains, I have none such anywhere, nor has any one in those parts. It remains to let you know the price at which it seems the property can be bought : three millions of sesterces,f not but what it was at one time five milKons, f but owing to this miserable BOOK III. io8 state of the farmers and the generally unfavourable times, the income from the land has gone back and the price with it. You will ask whether I can easily raise even this sum of three millions ? True, nearly the whole of my property is in land, yet I have some money out at interest, and it will not be difficult for me to borrow. My mother- in-law will accommodate me, whose cash-box is as much at my service as my own. Accordingly do not let this in- fluence you, if the remaining considerations are not in the way, all of which I would beg you to examine with the utmost care. For as in all other matters, so in the dis- posal of property, you are rich in experience and in judgment. Now, however, in the Senate, this same practice has been approved as the best, without any difference of opi- nion. Every one, on the day of the Comitia, called for tablets. In truth, with our system of undisguised and open voting, we had come to exceed the licence of public meetings. No order in speaking, no silent reserve, not even the decorum of remaining seated, was attended to. In all directions there were loud and discordant clamours ; every one rushed forward with his own candidate ; there were a number of groups in the middle of the chamber, and a number of rings formed, and an unseemly confu- sion. To such an extent had we degenerated from the usage of our ancestors, in whose times everything was so carefully ordered and regulated and calmly conducted, as to preserve the majesty and reverence of the place. There are old men still living who tell me that the order of the Comitia was as follows : -The candidate was summoned io6 PLINY'S LETTERS. by name, upon which there was a dead silence. He spoke for himself, set forth his life, gave the names of his refer- ences and backers, either that of the officer under whom lie had served in the army, or else of the magistrate whose quaestor he had been, or of both, if he were able, to which he added those of some of his supporters. These spoke on his behalf with propriety, and shortly ; and this was of more avail than canvassing.* Sometimes a candidate would take exception to the birth, or the age, or even the char- acter of an opponent. The senate listened with the gra- vity of a censor. Hence merit generally prevailed over interest. Now that these usages have been corrupted by extravagant favouritism, recourse has been had to secret voting as a kind of remedy. And a remedy, for the time, it certainly was, being something quite new and unex- pected. But I fear that as time goes on the remedy itself will give birth to evils. There is, indeed, a danger that a contempt for honesty may steal into this silent voting : for how few there are who have the same rescard for their honour in private as they have publicly. Many stand in awe of public opinion, few of their own consciences. However, it is too soon to talk of what lies in the future ; for the present, by favour of the ballot, we shall have the magistrates whose appointment was most desirable. For, just as in proceedings where \" Eeciperators \" -f-are nominated, so we, at these Comitia, being as it were suddenly pounced upon, turned out honest judges. I have written this to you, first, in order to write of something new ; next that I may occasionally speak of public affairs : the occasions for which, as they are rarer for us than for our ancestors, so they are the less to be * Preces.

And, by Hercules, when shall we cease hear- ing those commonplace \" How d'ye do's ? \" and \" I hope you are wells ? \" I would have our letters be of those which contain something out of the common and the paltry, and what is confined to private interests. All things, to be sure, are at the disposal of one who, for the common advantage, has taken on himself single-handed the cares and labours of all ; yet by a healthful dispensa- tion of them there flow down even to us certain rills, so to speak, from that bounteous source, such as we cannot only drink in ourselves, but also in a manner supply to our absent friends through the medium of our letters. (21.) To COENELIUS PeISCUS. I hear that Valerius Martialis * is dead, and am sorry for it. He was a man of ingenuity, acuteness, and wit, one in whose writings there was a great deal of salt and gall, with no less kindliness. I made him a present to- wards his journey when he left the city. It was a gift in honour of our friendship, and also in honour of a short poem which he wrote about me. It was the custom of old to confer honorary distinctions or pecuniary rewards on those who had written the praises either of individuals or of cities ; but in our days, together with other admirable and excellent practices, this one has been among the first to grow obsolete. Since we have left off doing things worthy of being praised, we consider praise itself imper- tinent. You will ask for the verses for which I showed my gratitude. I would refer you to the volume itself if I did not happen to recollect some of them. If these should please you, you can look for the rest in the book.

Eegulus has lost his son; it was the only misfortune that he did not deserve, and I doubt whether he thinks it a misfortune.* He was a boy of quick parts, but uncertain character, yet one who might have pursued a right course provided he did not resemble his father. Eegulus had set the lad free from parental control, in order that he might be constituted heir to his mother, and having thus \" sold \"t him (so it was styled in common talk derived from the character of the man) proceeded to toady him under a disgusting and unparental pretence of indulging him. The thing seems incredible, but then remember Eegulus ! However, he mourns his son's loss like a madman. The boy had a number of ponies for harness and saddle ; he had dogs large and small, nightingales, parrots, and black- birds, all of which Eegulus slaughtered at the funeral pile. This was not grief, but the ostentation of grief. He is visited by a wonderful number of people, by all of whom he is abominated and detested ; yet just as though they esteemed and had a regard for him, they hurry to attend on him, and, to state shortly my opinion, in gaining the good graces of Eegulus, they make themselves like him. He keeps to his gardens on the other side of the Tiber, where he has covered a large space of ground with vast colonnades, as also the bank of the river with statues of himself. So lavish is he, with all his consummate avarice, and so vainglorious in the midst of his consummate infamy. Thus, he is a nuisance j to the city at this most unhealthy season, and his being a nuisance is a source of consolation * The meaning might also be, \" He which cannot be rendered.

You will soon hear of the wedding of this mourner, of this old mana wedding in one point of view too early, in another too late. You ask whence I aus^ur this. Not because he affirms it himself, for there does not exist a greater liar; but because it is certain that Eegulus will do whatever he ought not to do. (3-) To Arrius Antoninus. That you have been twice Consul, and one of antique mould ; that you have been Pro-consul of Asia, and such a one as either before you or after you has appeared but once or twice (your modesty does not allow me to say never) ; that by reason of your virtue and your authority, your age too, you are a Chief of the Stateall this claims reverence and admiration ; yet it is in your relaxations that / still more admire you. For, to season such majesty with a like degree of geniality, and to unite to the loftiest de- portment a disposition no less affable, this is as difficult as it is noble. And this you achieve not only by a certain incredible charm in your conversation, but also more par- ticularly by your writings. For, as you s^Deak, the famed honey of old Homer seems to flow forth, and what you write the bees seem to fill with the nectar of their flowers.* Such certainly was the impression made on myself when reading lately your Greek epigrams and iambics. What polish of diction there is in them, what attractiveness of form, how sweet, how full of love, how melodious, how appropriate they are ! I thouglit I had got hold of Calli- machus, or Herodes, or something still better, if there be such. Yet neither of these authors carried to perfection, or even attempted, both kinds of composition.! That a * Complerejloribusetnectare. Keil f i.e., Epigrams and Iambics, reads, Complere Jloribus et innectere. Pliny seems to have been mistaken But bees stringing togetlier flowers about Callimacbus. seems a violent metaphor. Eoman citizen should write such Greek ! As true as Heaven, I should not call Athens herself so Attic. Whysay more ? I envy the Greeks in that you have preferred to write in their tonoiue. Nor is there much need to con- jecture what you would be able to produce in your native language, if you can turn out such admirable works in a foreign and transplanted one. (4.) To Sosius Senecio. I have a very strong regard for Varisidius Nepos, an industrious, learned, and, what with me has the greatest possible weight, an honest man. At the same time he is very closely connected with C. Calvisius, my old crony and your friend, being indeed his sister's son. I beg that you will add to his lustre, both in his own and his maternal uncle's eyes, by conferring on him a tribuneship for six months. You will oblige me, you will oblige our friend Calvisius, you will oblige Nepos himself, who will prove a debtor no less to your mind than you esteem us to be. You have conferred many favours on many people, yet I venture to contend that there is none which you will have invested to greater advantage, and only one here and there so well. (50 To Spaesus. They relate that ^^schines, at the request of the Eho- dians, recited an oration of his own, and afterwards one by Demosthenes, each of them amid loud applause. I do not wonder that this fortune should have attended the pro- ductions of such men, seeing that a very learned audience lately listened to an oration of my own with so much zeal and approval, and application even, for two whole days, although there was no comparison between one author and another, no contest, so to speak, to kindle their atten- BOOK IV. 113 tion. For the PJiodians were incited not only by the actual merits of the orations, but also by the stimulus of comparison, while my oration was approved without the advantage of rivalry. Whether this approval was deserved or not you will learn when you have read the speech itself, the extent of which does not permit me to preface it by a more protracted letter. For lure, certainly, where brevity is possible, I ought to be brief, so that the speech itself may find the more excuse for its length, though it is not lengthened beyond the importance of its theme, (6.) To Julius Naso. My Tuscan produce has been swept off by the hail. In the country over the Po we are informed of great abundance, but proportionate low prices. My Laurentine property is the only one that brings me in anything. To be sure, I own nothing there beyond a house and garden and the immediate sands, yet it is the only one that brings me in anything. For there I write a great deal, and improve, not the land (which I have not got), but myself by means of study ; and just as in other places I can show you a full barn, so here I can actually show you a full escritoire.* Do you, too, then, if you are anxious for an estate with a safe income and fertile soil, provide yourself with some- thing on this coast. \"o (7.) To Catius Lepidus. I often tell you that there is energy f in Eegulus. It is wonderful how he accomplishes whatever he has applied himself to. He was pleased to mourn for his son.

H to have as many statues and likenesses made of liim as possible. Well, lie sets to work in all the studios, and turns out the boy in colours, ditto in wax, ditto in brass, ditto in silver, ditto in gold, in ivory, in marble. Then, for his own account, he lately invited a huge audience, and read out to them a book all about his life the life of a boy ! However, he read it out ; and this same book, after it had been transcribed into a thousand copies, he distributed throughout the whole of Italy and the provinces, with public instructions in writing, to the effect that the Decurions* should choose one out of their own number, with the best voice, to read it to the people. Tliis was done accordingly. If he had only directed to better purposes this energy of his (or by whatever other name we are to call the determination to obtain all one's ends), how much good he might have effected ! Though, to be sure, there is less energy in good than in bad men, and just as \" resolution is engendered by ignorance and hesitation by reflection,\" f so honest natures are enfeebled by their modesty, while perverse ones are encouraged by their effrontery. Eegulus is an example of this. He has weak lungs, a confused utterance, a faltering delivery, the slowest faculty of imagination, no memory at all ; nothing, in short, beyond his wild capacity, and yet through his impudence and this very frantic power of his he has got to the point of being esteemed an orator. Hence Herennius Senecio applied to him admirably the converse of you yourself, perhaps, have read out, like a cheap-jack in the forum, this doleful production of Eegulus ; \" raising your voice,\" to wit, as Demosthenes has it, \" and full of glee, and straining your windpipe.\" Indeed, it is so silly that it is calculated to excite laughter more than lamenta- tion. You would imagine it was written not about a boy, but hy a boy. (8.) . To Matukus Arrianus. You congratulate me on my having been invested with the Augurship. You are warranted in your congratula- tions, first of all, because it is a great thing to win the deliberate approval of a most exemplary prince even where the matter is a small one ; next, because the priestly office is not only by nature an ancient one connected with re- ligion, but is moreover rendered completely sacred and exceptional in this respect that it cannot be taken from the holder during his lifetime. For other offices, though almost on a par with this in point of dignity, as they are conferred, so in like manner they can be taken away. In regard to this one, the power of Fortune does not go be- yond the matter of granting it. Moreover, to me it seems an additional cause of conOTatulation that I have succeeded Julius Frontinus, a man of great mark, who on the day of nomination for these several past years in succession used to propose me for the priesthood, as though adopting me into his place, an act which now the event has approved in such a way that it cannot seem to have been fortuitous. You, however, as you write, are chiefly delighted at my being augur because M. TuUius* was one. You are re- joiced, that is, at my stepping into the honours of one whom I long to emulate in my intellectual pursuits. But oh that, as like him I have obtained the priestly office and the consulship, and indeed at a much earlier time of life than his, so also, in old age at any rate, I might attain to some share of his mental powers ! Yet, to be sure, what is in the power of man falls to my lot as well as to that of many others. But in proportion as it is difficult to acquire, so is it too much even to hope for gifts which lie in the hands of the gods alone. (9.) To Cornelius Uesus. Julius Bassus has been upon his defence during the last few days, a man who has seen much trouble, and one cele- brated for his misfortunes. He was accused under Vespa- sian by two persons in a private station, then sent before the Senate, where he remained long in suspense, at last acquitted and discharged. He stood in fear of Titus, as being a friend of Domitian's, and by Domitian himself he was banished. Eecalled by Xerva, he had the province of Bithynia allotted to him, and returned thence under im- peachment, being as eagerly prosecuted as he was faithfully defended. He encountered various judgments in the Senate, most of them, however, taking a lenient view. Pomponius Eufus appeared for the prosecution, a ready and powerful speaker. He was followed by Theophanes, one of the ^Drovincial agents, the firebrand and originator of the accusation. I replied. For Bassus had charged me to establish the groundwork of his entire defence ; to speak of his distinctions, which, from the splendour of his family and the actual perils he had undergone, were great; of the conspiracy of the informers against him, which they were working for their own profit; of the causes of his having given offence to the most factious fellows, such as this very Theophanes. He had wished me at the same time to advance and meet the charcre which pressed him most closely. Eor, as to other charges, how- ever serious they might sound, he deserved not merely ac- quittal, but even praise. What weighed on him was thisthat, being a simple and unsuspecting man, he had accepted BOOK IV, 117 certain gifts from the provincials in the character of their friend, for he had once been Quaestor in the same province. These, his accusers termed plunder and rapine : lie-termed them presents. But the law forbids even presents being accepted. Hereupon, what was I to do, what course of defence was I to enter upon ? Should I traverse the fact ? I was apprehensive that it would appear plainly to be \" plunder \" from my being afraid to admit it. Moreover, to deny a matter that was clear would be to act so as to augment the gravity of the accusation, instead of impairing it, particularly where the defendant himself had left no option to his counsel. For he had told a number of people, and even the Emperor, that he had accepted these \" little presents \" alone (and sent many of the same kind) merely on the occasion of his birthday, or during the Saturnalia. Should I implore pardon for him then ? It would be cutting the defendant's throat to concede that he had erred in such a way that he could only be saved by a pardon. Should I defend the act as a legitimate one ? I should have done him no good, and should only have exhibited my own effrontery. In this strait I determined to preserve a land of middle course, and I seem to have succeeded. My speech, as in the case of battles, was stopped by nightfall. I had spoken for three hours and a half : one hour and a half remained to me. For since, in accordance with law, the prosecutor had been granted six hours, and the defendant nine, the latter had so divided the time between me and the counsel who was to follow me, that I could employ five hours and he the remainder. But the success of my speech prompted me to say no more and to make an end of it. For it is rash not to be satisfied with what has gone off well. Besides, I feared that my bodily strength might fail me for a renewed effort, it being more difficult to resume than to continue without a break. There was danger, too, that the rest of my speech might suffer a chill as a thing that had been put by, and might prove tedious as a thing brought out afresh. For, just as torches preserve Il8 PLINY'S LETTERS. their fire by being constantly shaken, and renew it with great difficulty when it has been once let down, so the warmth of the speaker and the attention of the hearer are kept up by continuity, and are weakened by intermission and, if I may so speak, relaxation. However, Bassus, with many prayers and almost tears, begged me to complete my time ; so I complied, preferring his interests to my own. Success attended me: the minds of the Senate were so attentive and so fresh that they seemed to be whetted rather than satisfied by my previous speech. Lucceius Albinus followed me, so appo- sitely that our speeches might be thought to unite the variety of two, with the consistency of a single oration, Herennius made a spirited and weighty reply, then came Theophanes again. For here too, as usual, he behaved with consummate impudence, in that, after two speakers, men of consular rank as well as of eloquence, he claimed further time for himself, and that, too, pretty freely. He spoke till nightfall and even after nightfall, lights having been brought in. The next day, Homullus and Fronto spoke admirably for Bassus, and the fourth day was occupied by the examination of proofs, Bsebius Macer, Consul-Elect, gave it as his opinion that Bassus had sub- jected himself to the law against bribery and extortion; Csepio Hispo, that he should retain his Senatorial rank, and have judges assigned him.* Both of them were in the right. How can that be, you ask, when they gave such opposite opinions ? Why, because Macer, looking to the law, was quite consistent in condemning one who had accepted presents contrary to law ; and Csepio, deeming that the Senate has the power, as certainly it has, to mitigate the force of laws as well as to construe them strictly, was not without reason in extending a pardon to acts which, though forbidden, are not unfrequently practised. The opinion of Cijepio prevailed : nay more, when he rose to state it, he was cheered as Senators usually are * See ii. ii, note. BOOK IV. 119 on resuming their seats : from this, you may judge what approval greeted what he dul say, when such favour was shown to what it was supposed that he would say. However, not only in the Senate but also in the city, there are two divisions of opinion. For, those who approve the proposal of Csepio find fault with that of Macer as being too harsh and severe : while those who go with Macer, style the former a lax and indeed an inconsistent proposal : for they say that it is not consistent to retain a man in the Senate to whom judges have been assigned. There was also a third proposition : Valerius Paulinus, agreeing with Ctepio, was for adding to the motion, that Theophanes be proceeded against at the termination of his agency. For he was charged with having done many acts in the course of the prosecution which were infringements of the very law in virtue of which he had accused Bassus. But this motion, greatly as it approved itself to a large majority of the Senate, was not acted on by the Consuls. However, Paulinus obtained credit for his honesty and courage. On the adjournment of the Senate, Bassus was welcomed by a large concourse, and with great shouting and joy. He had been made popular by this revival of the old tradition of his troubles, by his name known through the perils with which it was connected, by his advanced age with its dejection and squalor * united to a stately figure. Take this interim letter as an avant-courier, and look out for my oration in full, and charged with matter : you will, however, have to look out for it for a good long time : for it will have to be retouched, considering the importance of the subject, with no light or superficial hand. (10.) To Statius Sabinus. You write me word that Sabina, who has left us her heirs, though she has nowhere directed that Modestus her * The squalid appearance affected by accused persons. PLINY'S LETTERS. slave should be freed, nevertheless has added a legacy in his favour in these terms, \" To Modestus, whom I directed to be freed.\" You ask for my view. I have consulted legal authorities ; all are of the same opinion, that he cannot claim his liberty, because it has not been granted him, nor again his legacy, because it was given to a slave. But to me this seems a clear case of slip : I am therefore of opinion that we should do, just as if Sabina had directed it, that which certainly she herself thought she had directed. I am confident that you will accede to my judgment, since you are in the habit of observing most religiously the wishes of the departed, which once under- stood will have the force of law for honest heirs. For, with us, honour weighs no less than necessity with others. Let the man remain free then, with our consent ; let him enjoy his legacy as though every precaution had been carefully taken. Indeed, Sabina lias taken these precau- tions, since she has made a prudent choice of heirs. (II.) To Cornelius Minicianus. Have you heard that Valerius Licinianus is lecturing in Sicily ? I fancy you have not yet heard it, for the news is but recent. This personage of Preetorian rank was lately esteemed among the most eloquent members of the bar ; he has now fallen so low as to have become an exile instead of a senator, a teacher of rhetoric instead of an orator. Hence, he himself, in a prefatory address, ex- claimed in sorrowful and solemn tones, \" What sport dost thou make for thyself, oh Fortune ! For thou makest Professors out of Senators, and Senators out of Professors !\" a sentiment in which there is so much bile and bitterness, that he seems to me to have turned Professor for the ex- press purpose of uttering it. This same man, when he had made his entrance, clad in a Greek mantle (for those who are interdicted from fire and water * are deprived of the right to wear the toga), after he had settled himself and given an eye to his dress, remarked, \" I am going to declaim in Latin V All very sad and pitiful, you will say, but the man deserved it for having polluted this very profession of eloquence by the guilt of incest. To be sure, he confessed to the incest, but it is uncertain whether he did this because it was the fact, or because he feared worse con- sequences if he denied it. Domitian was at that time raging and storming, abandoned to his own resources,f in the midst of the vast odium he had incurred. For wdien he had become bent on burying alive Cornelia, the chief of the Vestal virgins, under the notion that his reign would be illustrated by examples of this kind ; in virtue of his right as Pontifex Maximus, or rather, with the brutality of a tyrant and the licence of a despot, he summoned his colleagues, not to the Pontifical palace, but to his Alban villa. Then, with a wickedness not falUng short of that which he had the air of punishing, he pro- nounced her guilty of incest, in her absence and without hearing her ; he, the very man who had not only incestuously polluted his brother's daughter, but had murdered her into the bargain, for she died of abortion in her widowhood. The Pontifices were despatched forthwith to see to Cornelia's being buried and put an end to. As for her, raising her hands, now to Vesta, now to the rest of the gods, she uttered, among many cries, this one most often, \" Does Ccesar deem me, incestuous, who performed the sacred rites when he conquered, when he triumphed ? \" Whether she said this with the intention to flatter or else to mock him, whether from confidence in her own virtue or from contempt for the Emperor, is a matter of doubt however, she kept on saying it till she was led to execution, innocent or not I cannot say, but certainly with the ap- pearance of innocence. Moreover, as she was being escorted down to that terrible subterranean dung;eon, her dress catching in the course of her descent, she turned round and disengaged it, and on the executioner offerincr her his hand, she shuddered and started back, rejecting this foul pollution of her person, as though evidently chaste and pure, with a last expression of sanctity, and, exhibiting in all points her modest demeanour, \" Took every care to fall with decency.\" * Moreover, Celer, a Eoman knight, who was charged as the accomplice of Cornelia, had persisted in crying out, while being beaten with rods in the Comitium, \" What have I done ? I have done nothing ! \" Domitian, then, was raging under a sense of the ill repute of his cruelty and injustice. So he pounced on Licinianus for concealing a freedwoman of Cornelia at his country place. The latter was forewarned by those who had charge of him to take refuge in a confession, as in a means of pardon, if he had not a mind for the Comitia and the rods. This he did. Herennius Senecio spoke for him, in his absence, somewhat after the fashion of the well- known \" Patroclus is dead.\" -f For he said, \" Instead of pleading a cause, I have only a message to deliver. Licinianus abandons his defence.\" This was very agree- able to Domitian, so much so that he could not help showing his joy, and saying, \" Licinianus clears us.\" He went so far as to add, \" that the culprit's shame should not be pressed too hard,\" and permitted him, in fact, to carry off anything he could from his effects, before his property was confiscated, granting him an easy place of exile as a kind of premium. Thence, however, he was subsequently * A line from the ' Hecuba ' of concisely as Antilochus did when an-Euripides. nouncing to Achilles the death of f I.e., spoke for him as briefly and Patroclus. BOOK IV. 123 transferred, \"by the clemency of the late Emperor Nerva, to Sicily, where he now gives lectures and revenges him- self on fortune by his prefatory addresses. You see the readiness with which I obey you, in that I write to you not only of town affairs, but foreign ones as well, and with such care as to trace them to their source. And to be sure I thought that, as you were absent at the time, you had heard nothing further of Licinianus than that he had been banished for incest. Eor Fame reports to us the substance of things, not their details. I deserve that you, in turn, should write me in full about what is passing in your town and neighbourhood (where events worthy of notice not unfrequently occur) ; in short, relate whatever you please, provided only your letter be as long as mine. I shall count not only the sheets, but the lines and syllables into the bargain. (12.) To Matukus Akrianus. You love Egnatius Marcellinus, and indeed often com- mend him to me. You will love him and commend him still more, when you are made acquainted with a recent action of his. When he had gone out to his province as Quaestor, and had lost there a clerk who had been allotted him, before the latter had become entitled to his salary, he felt, and so decided, that the amount which he had received for the purpose of paying the clerk, ought not to remain in his hands. Consequently, on his return, he consulted Csesar, and afterwards, by Caesar's advice, the Senate, as to what they would have done with the salary. It was a small question; still it xvas a question. The clerk's heirs claimed the amount for themselves, and the heads of the Treasury claimed it for the public. The case was tried. Counsel spoke for the heirs and, after that, for the public : both of them excellently well. Csecilius Strabo moved that the money should be paid into the Treasury ; Bsebius Macer that it should be handed to the heirs. Strabo prevailed. Do you give all credit to Mar- cellinus, as I did on the spot. For, though it be abundantly sufficient for him to be approved both by the Prince and the Senate, yet he will rejoice in your testimony. All those indeed who are led by glory and fame are marvel- lously pleased with approval and praise, even when these proceed from their inferiors : whereas, in your case, Marcellinus holds you in such respect that he attributes the greatest weight to your judgment. Add to this that if he shall learn of this action of his penetrating as far as you, he will necessarily be delighted with the reach and the progress and the wide sweep of his repute. Since, I know not how it is, but men are still more pleased by an ex- tended than by a great reputation. (13-) To Cornelius Tacitus. I am glad you have arrived in town safely : and if ever before now your arrival has been looked for by me, it has been particularly so on the present occasion. I myself shall remain yet a few days at my Tusculan place, in order to complete a literary trifle now on hand. For I fear that if my ardour were relaxed just as the work approaches completion, it would with difficulty be re- sumed. Meanwhile, to satisfy my impatience, what I shall ask of you when we meet, I now request in this letter which is, so to speak, my avant-courier. But first let me tell you the reasons for my request. In the course of a recent visit to my native parts, a youth, the son of one of my townsmen, came to pay Jbis respects to me. To whom -\" Are you studying ? \" said I. \"Certainly,\" he answered. \"Wliere?\" \"At Milan.\" \"Why not here ? \" Said his father (for he was with the boy, and indeed had himself brought him), \" Because we have no teachers here.\" \" Why have you none ? Surely, it would BOOK IV. 125 be greatly to the interest of you who are fathers,\"and very opportunely there were several fathers within hearing -\" that your children should be instructed here rather than anywhere else. Where indeed could they spend their time more pleasantly than in their own neighbourhood, or be subject to more virtuous supervision than under the eyes of their parents, or be at smaller cost than at home ? How easy it would be then to unite in subscribing for the purpose of engaging teachers, and to add what is now spent on lodgings, on travelling-expenses, on all those things which have to be purchased away from home (and everything has to be purchased away from home) to the salaries devoted to them. Nay, further, I who have as yet no children, am prepared on behalf of our common- wealth, as though she were a daughter or a parent, to contribute a third part of whatever you shall determine to subscribe. I would even promise the whole amount, were it not for the fear that such a gift might one day be perverted by means of jobbery, as I see happens in many places where teachers are engaged at the public expense. This abuse can only be met by one remedy, and that is, that the right of making these engagements should be left to the parents alone, and that the conscientious care of deciding rightly should be imposed on them by the necessity of subscribing. For those who would perhaps be careless of other people's property, will certainly be careful of their own, and will see to it that none but a deserving person shall receive my money, if he is to receive theirs as well. Accordingly, I would have you come to an agreement, and band yourselves together, and derive addi- tional spirit from me, who am desirous that the sum which I shall have to contribute may be as large as possible. You can confer nothing more desirable on your children, or more grateful on your own neighbourhood. Let those who are born here be educated here, and from their very infancy let them grow accustomed to love and to inhabit their native soil. And I pray that you may introduce teachers of such repute that this will be a source to which neighbouring towns will resort for learning, and that, just as now your children flock to other places, so strangers may soon flock to this place.\" I have thought it best to repeat all this in detail, and from its source, so to speak, in order that you might the better understand how agreeable it would be to me if you would undertake my commission. ISTow I commission, and in view of the importance of the matter, entreat you that out of the great number of learned persons who frequent you, from an admiration of your genius, you would look about for some teachers such as we might invite, yet subject to this condition, that I must not be held to pledge myself to any one of them. For I reserve complete freedom for the parents ; tlicy must judge, tliey must choose: trouble and expense is all / claim for myself. Accordingly, if any one be found who has confidence in his own capacity, let him go there with this understanding, that he takes with him from these parts no assurance, save that which he derives from himself. (I4-) To Paternus. You perhaps, as your way is, are calling for, and indeed expecting an oration from me. But Ias though drawing from some foreign and luxurious waresproduce for you my poetical recreations. You will receive with this letter some hendecasyllables of mine, with which I amuse my leisure hours, when out driving, or in the bath, or at dinner-time. In these I jest, disport myself, make love, grieve, complain, am angry, indulge in descriptions, at times in a homely, at others in a more elevated strain, and, by the very variety of treatment, aim at this result, that while different parts may please different people, there may be some parts which will possibly please everybody. If, however, some of the number shall appear to you a BOOK IV. 127 trifle too saucy, it will become one of your learning to re- flect that those men of great position and high dignity who have written this kind of thing, have not abstainedto say nothing of frolicsome themesfrom the most naked expressions. These last I have avoided, not from my being more austere (how indeed could that be ?) but from my being more timid than they. Besides, I know that the truest law as to these trifles is that which has been ex- pressed by Catullus. \" Though pious poets should themselves be chaste, It does not follow that their strains should be, Which then alone of salt will have a taste, If they be wanton and a trifle free.\" As for me, what an account I make of your judgment, you may estimate e'en from this, that I have preferred that the whole collection should be pondered by you, rather than that selected pieces should meet with your approval. And to be sure the happiest pieces would cease to seem such, as soon as they were matched by others of the same sort. Besides, a sensible and critical reader ought not to compare different kinds of productions with each other, but to estimate each production singly, and not to consider as inferior to another piece a piece which is perfect in its own kind. But why add more ? For either to excuse or to commend trifles by a long preface would itself be the height of trifling. There is just one thing which it seems to me ought to be said beforehand, namely, that I think of calling these nugse of mine \" Hendecasyllables,\" a title which refers merely to the metre. Accordingly, you may call them, if you like, epigrams or idylls or eclogues, or (as many have it) short poems, or by any other name which you prefer ; / guaran- tee Hendecasyllables only. I ask of your candour that whatever you will say to others of my small book that you will say to me. Nor is what I ask difQcult. For if this little work of mine were either my best or my only one, perhaps it might seem harsh to say \" Seek some other occupation ; \" but in all gentleness and courtesy it might be said, \" You liam other occupations.\" (ISO To FUNDANUS. If there is anything at all in which I show my judgment, it is certainly in my singular affection for Asinius Eufus. He is an excellent man, and one who has a great regard for all good people. (For why should I not count myself, too, among the good?) This same Ptufus has attached himself to Cornelius Tacitus -and you know what lu ison the closest terms of intimacy. Accordingly, if you hold us both in esteem, needs must be that you have the same opinion of Eufus ; since, for the cementing of friend- ships, the strongest of all ties is to be found in a resemblance of characters. He has several children. For in this re- spect, too, he has discharged the office of an admirable citizen, in that he has desired to profit largely by the fruit- fulness of his wife, in an age when the prizes open to a childless condition make even an only son an encumbrance to many.*. Despising such considerations, he has entitled himself to the additional name of grandfather, for he is a grandfather ; and through Saturius Firmus too, whom you will cherish as I do, when you have made as close ac- quaintance with him as I have. All which goes to this, that you may learn how important, how numerous a family you will lay under an obligation by one friendly act ; to ask for which I am led first of all by my wishes, and next by a certain happy omen. For I wish you and also prog- nosticate for you the Consulship next year ; this your own merits and the Prince's opinion of you lead me to augur. It would fit in with this, that Asinius Bassus, the eldest of Eufus's children, should be Quaestor in the same year, a * An allusion to the court paid to childless people, with the view of getting a legacy. BOOK IV. 129 young man (I don't know whetlier I ought to say what the father wishes me both to think and to say, but the youth's modesty forbids) superior even to his father. It woukl be difficult for you to believe, on my report of one who is absentthough, to be sure, you do believe me in everythingthat he can possess so much industry, probity, learning, intelligence, zeal, and finally memory, as you will find that he does when you have tried him. I only wish our age were so fruitful in good qualities that you would be bound to prefer some others to Bassus ; in that case I should be the first to exhort and admonish you to look around you and indeed debate a long time as to the best ob- ject of your choice. As it is, howeveryet I do not wish to speak in any way presumptuously of my friendat any- rate this only will I say, that the young man is worthy to be adopted by you as a son, after the fashion of our ances- tors.* For sages, such as you, ought to accept from the State such children, so to speak, as we pray to receive from Nature. It will be a credit to you in your consul- ship to have a Quaestor whose father is of Prietorian, whose relatives are of Consular rank, and who, according to their own judgment, though still but a youth, has never- theless already reflected a mutual lustre on them. Accordingly favour my prayers, follow my advice, and above all, if I seem importunate, forgive me : first, because in a State in which everything is set about by those who, so to speak, take time by the forelock, efforts delayed till the regular time are apt to be too late instead of being in season; next, because, in regard to matters which one is anxious to obtain, the very anticipation of them is a pleasure. Let Bassus begin to revere you as his Consul; do you cherish him as your Quaestor. Finally, let us, who are deeply at- tached to both of you, enjoy in full a double delight. For since we have such a regard both for you and for Bassus that we should assist, in his pursuit of the honour, with all our resources, exertions, and influence, either Bassus, if nomi- * Alluding to the close connection between Consul and Quaestor. I 130 PLINY'S LETTERS. nated Quaestor by amj consul, or any Quaestor nominated by you,* so it would be particularly agreeable to us if the circumstances of our friendship and your consulship should be the means of combining our efforts on this one young man ; if, in short, you of all others should help my prayers with your assistance, whose choice the Senate will most willingly concur in, and to whose testimony it will attach the greatest weight, (i6.) To Valerius Paulinus. Eejoice on my account, rejoice on your own, nay more, rejoice on the public account. Honour still continues to be paid to intellectual pursuits.! On a recent occasion, when I was about to speak before the Centumviri, there was no way for me to get into the court except by the bench and right through the Judges : all the other parts were so closely packed. Add to this that a well-dressed youth, whose tunic had been torn, as often happens in a crowd, persisted in standing, wrapped up in his toga only, and that for seven hours ; for I spoke as long as that, not without great exertion and still greater effect. Let us follow our intellectual pursuits, then, and not allege other folks' slothfulness as an excuse for our own. There are those who will listen, there are those who will read, if only we take pains to produce what is worthy of people's ears or of the paper on which it is written. (17-) To AsiNius Gallus. You not only admonish, but also entreat me to under- take the cause of Corellia, in her absence, against C. I am obliged to you for your admonition, but must complain of your entreat- ing me. For I ought to be admonished, to be informed, but I ought not to be entreated to do that which in my case it would be highly discreditable not to do. Can / hesitate to support the daughter of Corellius ? There exists, to be sure, between me and the person against whom you invoke my aid, if not an absolute intimacy, still a friendship. Add to tliis the position of the man, and this very post of honour to which he is designated, to which it becomes me to pay all the more respect in that I have myself before now filled it. Indeed it is natural that one should wish to attach the greatest distinction to that which has been enjoyed by one's self. But when I reflect that it is on behalf of the daughter of Corellius that I am to appear, all these considerations seem frigid and futile. Before my eyes is the image of that great man, than whom our age has produced none of greater dignity and piety and acuteness of judgment ; whom, when I had begun to love him owing to my admiration for him, I admired still more (the contrary of which usually happens), after becoming thoroughly acquainted with him. For I ivas thoroughly acquainted with him. He had no secret for me, either in his jesting or his serious, his sad or his cheerful moods. I was still a stripling, and already he paid me the same honour, and I will venture to say it, respect, as to an equal. He was my supporter and backer whenever I stood for office. He helped to escort and attend upon me when I entered on my charge, he was my adviser and guide in filling it. In short, whenever I had a function to fill, there was he, though feeble and old, to be seen, just as though he had been young and robust. How much did he add to my reputation in private, in public, and even with the prince ! For the conversation happening to turn, in the presence of the Emperor Nerva, on virtuous young men, and several persons having praised me, he remained silent for awhile, a habit which added greatly to his im- pressiveness ; and then, with that dignity which you remember, \" Needs must be,\" says he, \" that I should be more sparing of my praises of Secundus, inasmuch as he does nothing save by my advice.\" In this remark he attributed to me what it would have been extravagant to ask for in my prayers ; namely, that I did nothing except with the utmost wisdom, inasmuch as all that I did was by the advice of the wisest of men. More than this, on his death-bed, he said to his daughter (she tells the story herself), \" I have prepared for you many friends, in virtue of my long life ; but the chief of them are Secundus and Cornutus.\" When I recall this, I understand that everv effort must be used by me, not to seem to fall short in any way of the confidence reposed in me by a man of such sagacity. Wherefore, for my part, I shall certainly assist Corellia with all promptitude, and shall not refuse to expose myself to resentments. Though I expect to obtain not only pardon but even approval from the person himself : who, as you say, prosecutes a suit which is a novel one as beincj against a woman :* if I mention all these circumstances in my speechof course with greater detail and fulness than the narrow limits of a letter per- miteither by way of excuse or even of taking credit to myself. (i8.) To Arrius Antoninus. In what way can I better prove to you the extent of my admiration for your Greek Epigrams than by the fact that I have attempted to imitate and render some of them in Latin ? Much for the worse, however ! This has been caused, in part, by the feebleness of my own powers, but also by the poverty, or rather, as Lucretius has it, by the penury of our native tongue. However, if these produc- tions, which are both written in Latin and written by me, * Not knowing the character of the suit, we are unable to explain this. BOOK IV. 133 shall seem to you to possess any attractions, what, think you, must be the charm of those which have been pro- duced by you and produced in Greek ? (19.) To Calpurnia Hispulla. As you are a model of dutiful affection, as you cherished that excellent brother of yours, who loved you so much, with a regard equal to his, as you cherish his daughter as if she were your own, exhibiting towards her the affection not merely of an aunt, but even of the father whom she has lostfor these reasons, I doubt not, it will be a great joy to you to learn that she is turning out worthy of her father, worthy of you, worthy of her grandfather. She is gifted with remarkable quickness, as well as discretion, and she loves me, which is a token of her purity. To this must be added a love of literature which she has conceived from her tenderness for me. She has got my works, and studies them and even learns ' them by heart. How great is her anxiety when she sees me going to speak in court, and how great her joy when I have spoken ! She sets messengers about to report to her what favour and applause I have excited, and what is the result of the trial. Then, when- ever I recite, she sits hard by, separated from us only by a curtain, and catches up with eager ears the praises be- stowed on me. She even sings verses of my composing and sets them to her guitar, with no professor to teach her save love, the best of masters. All this leads me to entertain the surest hope of an unbroken harmony be- tween us, destined to increase day by day. Eor it is not my youth,* nor my personthings which gradually perish and grow oldit is my fame that she cherishes. Nor would any other conduct befit one who has received her education at your hands, who has been formed by your pre- * Aetatem, literally, \"time of life.\" Pliny was probably about forty at this time. cepts, and who in your abode has witnessed nothing but what was pure and honourable, who, lastly, has grown ac- customed to love me, through your commendations of me. For as you revered my mother in the place of a parent, so from my very boyhood were you in the habit of forming me, of praising me, of prognosticating that I should be such as I now appear to my wife to be. We vie with each other, then, in thanking you : I for your having given her to me, she for your having given me to her, as though you had chosen us for each other. (20.) To Nonius Maximus. What my opinion was of your books,* taken singly, I made known after reading through each of them ; now you shall hear my general judgment on the whole collection. Your work is noble, vigorous, passionate, elevated, diversi- fied, chaste, rich in figures, comprehensive too, and of a copiousness which reflects credit on the author. In this Avork you have taken the widest range, and borne on by the sails of your genius as well as of your grief, each of which has mutually assisted the other. For your genius has added sublimity and grandeur to your grief, and your grief has lent force and pungency to your genius. (21.) To Velius Cekealis. How sad, how untimely the fate of the sisters Helvidise ! Both have died after child-birth, both of them after bear- ing daughters. I am tormented by grief, nor do I grieve unreasonably. So mournful a thing does it seem to me that these virtuous young ladies should have been carried off, by their fruitfulness, in the flower of their age. I am pained at the lot of the infants so immediately and at the * Lihris, here the divisions of a book ; probably \" cantos.\" BOOK IV. 135 moment of their birth bereaved of their parents ; I am pained on account of the excellent husbands, and indeed on my own account as well. For I cherish an enduring affection for the father of these young ladies, though he be now no more ; as has been testified by a speech of mine and by my books. Only one of his three children now survives, and in his desolation is the support and stay of a house lately grounded on so many props. Yet my grief will be greatly alleviated and assuaged if fortune shall preserve liirti at any rate in health and safety, and in resemblance to such a father and grandfather as his were. And I am the more anxious for his well-being and his good conduct, in consequence of his having become an only child. You know the softness of my disposition in matters of affection, and you know my nervousness : hence you ought to be the less surprised at my having great apprehensions in the case of one of whom I entertain great hopes. (22.) To Sempkonius Eufus. I have assisted at an inquiry held by our excellent Emperor, having been summoned as one of his assessors. An athletic contest used to be celebrated among the Viennenses * in accordance with some one or other's will. This contest, Trebonius Eufusan admirable man and a friend of mineput a stop to and abolished during his Duumvirship. It was alleged that he had no legal authority for thus acting. He pleaded his own cause in person with as much success as eloquence. What com- mended his address was that he spoke, as a Eoman and a good citizen should speak, in an affair concerning himself, in a well-considered dignified fashion. When the opinions of the judges were being taken in succession, Junius Mauricusthan whom there does not exist a more * The inhabitants of Vienna (now Vienne, in the South of France). inflexible and straicjlitforward mandeclared that the contest ought not to be restored to the Viennenses. He added, \" I wish these things could be done away with in Eome as well.\" Boldly and manfully spoken, you will say. To be sure. But this is nothing new on the part of Mauricus. He spoke just as manfully in the company of the Emperor Nerva. Nerva was dining with a few friends, and Veiento reclined next to him, and even on his bosom : I have said all, when I have named the man. The con- versation turned on Catullus Messalinus, who was blind, and in whom to a naturally cruel disposition were super- added the evils of blindness. He was without compunc- tion, without shame, without pity, on which account he was the more often hurled by Domitian -^just like darts which are themselves blind and without heed as they go alongagainst the best men of the State. It was this person's wickedness and sanguinary counsels that formed the subject of general conversation at the dinner-table , when the Emperor himself said, \" What must we suppose would have been his fate if he were still living ? \" Upon which Mauricus replied, \" He would be dining with us ! \" I have made a long digression, yet not unwillingly. (Jt was decided to do away with the contest, which has cor- rupted the morals of the Viennenses, as ours here do those of everybody ; for the vices of the Viennenses are confined to these people themselves, while ours travel far and wide, and, as in human bodies so in states, the worst diseases are those which are diffused from the head. \\ (Anon, n.d.) To PoMPONius Bassus. I was greatly pleased on learning from our common friends that you, agreeably to your wisdom, are systema- tically ordering, as well as bearing with, your retirement, that you have a delightful residence, that you are bodily BOOK IV. 137 active, now on land, now on the sea, that you argue a great deal, listen to a great deal, read a great deal with attention, and, though your knowledge is so extensive, never- theless learn something fresh every day. This is the way in which a man should grow old, who has filled the highest offices, and commanded armies and devoted himself en- tirely to the service of the State, as long as it was proper for him to do so ; for, early as well as middle life we are bound to bestow on our country, old age upon ourselves, as indeed the laws themselves admonish us, which restore the old man to rest. When will it be allowable for me, when will my age make it honourable, to imitate such a model of noble tranquillity ? When will my retirement be entitled to the name, not of slothfulness, but of repose ? (24.) To Fabius Valens. After speaking lately, before the Centumviri, in a case which went through the four divisions of the court,* the recollection occurred to me that in my youth I had simi- larly plead in a fourfold case. My mind, as often hap- pens, travelled a long way : I began to consider who in the latter and who in the former trial had been the compan- ions of my labours. I was the only one who had spoken in both ! Such are the changes which are produced either by the fragility of our mortal condition or by the fickle- ness of fortune. Some of those who pleaded on the former occasion are dead, others are in exile ; on one his age and his health have imposed abstinence from speaking ; an- other of his own accord enjoys a delightful repose; another is at the head of an army ; another has been excused from civil functions by the favour of the prince. And in con- * See i. 18. nection \"with myself how much that is changed ! My profession * was the cause of my advancement ; by my profession I was brought into danger, and then once more advanced. The friendship of the virtuous was an assist- ance to me, then it was against me, now once more it is an assistance. If you reckon by years, all this will seem but a short time ; if by the vicissitudes of events, an age. This may be a warning to despair of nothing, and not to put trust in anything, when we see so many mutations brought about in such a whirling cycle. However, it is my habit to share all my reflections with you, and to admonish you with the same precepts and examples as myself, and this has been the motive of my present letter. (25.) To Messius Maximus. I wrote you word there was reason to fear that some abuse might arise from the system of secret voting. The fact has occurred. At the last Comitia, on some of the tablets were found written a number of facetious expres- sions, and even indecent ones : on one in particular, in lieu of the candidates' names, there were those of some of his supporters. The Senate was furious, and with loud outcries invoked the anger of the Emperor against the writer. He, however, escaped discovery : it is even pro- bable that he was among those who expressed their indignation. What must we suppose this man's private life to be, when, in a matter of such importance, and on an occasion of such solemnity, he indulges in such buffoonery, who, in short, in the Senate, of all places, * Studia must have this sense here, the virtuous was against him, he He was in danger under Domitian. means in the time of Domitian.

BOOK IV. 139 exhibits his waggery and humour and smartness. Such additional license is imparted to ill-disposed minds by that assurance, \" Who will know anything about it ? \" This fellow must have called for a tablet, taken his pencil, and lowered his head to write, in awe of no one, and with no respect for himself. Hence these antics worthy of the stage-boards. What remedy can one discover ? Every- where the abuses are worse than the remedies. \" But this to one above us is a care,\" * whose watchful exertions are so much added to, day by day, by this im- potent and yet unbridled wantonness of our time. (26.) To Mj<:cilius ISTepos. You ask me to have my small productionswhich you have most carefully furnished yourself withread over and revised. What is there indeed that I ought to under- take more willingly, especially at your request? Por since you, a man of such dignity, learning, and eloquence, and in addition to this, one so fully occupied, being indeed about to undertake the government of an important provincesince you think it worth while to carry my writings about with you, with what diligence ought I to make provision that this portion of your baggage may not seem a superfluous encumbrance to you. I shall endeavour then, first, tQ make these companions of yours as agreeable to you as possible, and next, that on your return you shall find others such as you may like to add to these. For in no small degree am I urged on to fresh works by the fact that you are among my readers. * To the Emperor. A quotation probably from some lost Greek play. 1 40 PLINY 'S LETTERS. (27.) To PoMPEius Falco. It is just three days since I attended a recitation by Sentius Augurinus, with the greatest pleasure, and indeed admiration, as far as I am concerned. His title is \" Short Poems.\" There is much that is simple, much that is elevated, much of the graceful and the tender, a great deal of sweetness, and a great deal of bile in them. It is some years, I think, since anything more perfect in the same style has been written : unless, it may be, I am deceived by my partiality for the writer, or by the circumstance that he has lauded me. Tor he has taken as the theme* of one of his pieces, that I sometimes disport myself in verse. Nay more, I will have you be judge of my judgment, if the second line of this very piece recurs to methe others I rememberstay, now, I have disen- tangled it. Sweetly flow my tender lays. Like Calvus' or Catallus' strains (Bards approved of ancient days), Where love in all its sweetness reigns. • Yet wherefore ancient poets name ? Let Pliny my example be ; Him the sacred wine inflame -More than ancient poets he ! To mutual love he tunes the lay, While far the noisy bar he flies ; Say then, ye grave, ye formal say, Who shall gentle love despise ? f You see how pointed, how apt, how expressive every- thing is. I promise you that the whole book corresponds to this taste of it, and I will send it you as soon as he has published it. Meanwhile, bestow your approval on the * Lemma, literally young man, and congratulate our epoch on the possession of such a genius, \"which is set off too by his virtuous con- duct. He spends his time with Spurinna and Antoninus ; he is related to one of them, and an intimate of both. You will hence be able to conjecture how blameless the youth must be who is thus loved by old men of such lofty worth - A man is like the company he keeps.* (28.) To YiBius Severus. Herennius Severus, a man of great culture, is extremely anxious to place in his library the likenesses of your townsmen, Cornelius Nepos and Titus Catius, and he begs me, if they can be found in your neighbourhood, as it is likely they may be, to give an order to have copies of them painted. This commission I enjoin on you parti- cularly : first, because you are most obliging in complying with my behests; next, because you have the highest regard for literature and the greatest affection for literary men ; lastly, because you venerate and cherish your native soil, and equally with that soil itself those who have added to its reputation. I beg further that you will engage as skilful a painter as possible. For since it is hard to produce a like- ness even from life, so the imitation of an imitation is a matter of extraordinary difficulty. And I beg that you will not suffer the artist whom you select to deviate from his copy, even in the direction of improving on it. (29O To EOMATIUS FlEMUS. Hark'ee, friend! when next business is being trans- acted, manage by hook or by crook to attend the trial. It is no good sleeping on your right side and trusting to me. Look you, Licinius Nepos when Praetora rigid and determined man as well as a Prsetoronce im- posed a fine even on a Senator. The latter pleaded his cause in the Senate, but he pleaded it as though suing for forgiveness. The fine was remitted; however, the man had a fright, and had to entreat, and a pardon was necessary. You will say, \"All Praetors are not so severe.\" You are mistaken ; for though only severe ones may establish or reintroduce precedents of this sort ; yet, when once they are established or reintroduced, even the most indulgent ones may put them in force. (30.) To Licinius Suka. I have brouglit you from my native parts, in lieu of a present, a problem in a high degree worthy of your great attainments. A certain spring rises in a mountain, and runs down through the rocks, till it is enclosed in a small dining-parlour made by hand ; after being slightly retarded there, it empties itself into the Larian lake. Its nature is very remarkable. Three times a day it is increased and diminished in volume by a regular rise and fall. This can be plainly seen, and when perceived is a source of great enjoyment. You recline close to it, and take your food and even drink from the spring itself (for it is remarkably cold) ; meanwhile, with a regular and measured movement, it either subsides or rises. If you place a ring or any other object on the dry ground, it is gradually moistened and finally covered over ; then again it comes to view, and is by degrees deserted by the water. If you watch long enough, you will see both of these pro- cesses repeated a second and even a third time. Can it be that some kind of hidden current of air at one time opens, and at another compresses, the mouth and jaws of BOOK IV. 143 the spring, according as it rushes in on its introduction, or recedes on being expelled ? We see that this happens in the case of narrow-necked vessels and objects of the same kind, with an orifice that is not wide, and is not immedi- ately open to the contents. For these, too, though they be turned over, or inclined, check the passage of what they pour forth, with a number of gulps, as it were, like the struggles of some resisting spirit. Or, is the nature of this spring the same as that of the ocean ; and in the same way as the latter ebbs and flows, is this small stream alternately drawn back and sent forth ? Or, again, like rivers which on their way to the sea are driven back by adverse winds and an opposing tide, so is there something which repels the free course of this spring ? Or is it that in its hidden ducts there is a regular reservoir, and that while this is collecting what has been exhausted, the stream is sent forth smaller and slower ; when it has col- lected it, swifter and larger ? Or, again, is there some sort of mysterious and hidden equipoise * which, when it is emptied, raises and elicits the spring ; when it is full, delays and throttles it ? Pray do you examine into the causes (as you are capable of doing) of this singular phenomenon. For my part, it is enough if I made sufficiently clear the effects. * It is well remarked by Doering here. \"We need not, therefore, strain that Pliny himself, by his language, ourselves in useless efforts to get out admits that he attaches no very clear a very precise sense. Still, the meaning to the terms which he uses general sense is clear enough. ( 144 ) BOOK V. (I.) To Annius Severus. A legacy has fallen to me, a small one, but more agree- able to me than tlie largest, \" Why more agreeable than the largest ? \" Pomponia Galla, having disinherited her son Asudius Curianus, had left me one of her heirs, and had given me for co-heirs Sertorius Severus, a man of Praetorian rank, and other distinguished Eoman knights. Curianus begged me to present my share to him, and thus help him with a precedent* At the same time, he promised that it should be secured to me by a tacit agreement to that effect. I replied that it was not in accordance with my character to do one thing openly and another thing in secret, besides that it was not quite respectable to make a present to one who was both rich and childless ; f in short, that it would be of no service to him if I presented him with my share, but that it would be of service to him if I withdrew my claim to it, and that I was prepared to do so, if it were made plain to me that he had been disinherited unjustly. Upon which, said he, \" Pray, investigate the matter.\" After a short hesitation, \" I will do so,\" I replied, \" for, indeed, I don't see why I should think myself of smaller account than I seem to you. | But please to bear this in mind at * 7. e., for getting their shares from f Pliny would have exposed himthe other heirs. If Pliny had pre-self to the suspicion of playing the tended to make a present of his captator, or fortune-hunter, by this legacy, it would have strengthened concession. Curianus' case, or, rather, he seems J I don't see why I should not to have thought soerroneously, as trust my own impartiality. Pliny directly tells him. BOOK V. 145 starting, that my determination will not fail me (in case that should seem the honest conclusion) to pronounce in favour of your mother. \" As you wish,\" said he, \" for you will wish nothing but what is most equitable.\" I called to my counsels two men of the highest character in the State at that time, Corellius and Frontinus, and with these on either side of me took my seat in my chamber. Curianus urged what he considered made for him ; I replied briefly (since there was no one else present to defend the honour of the deceased), then I retired to consult, and in accordance with the opinion of the council, \" It seems to us, Curianus,\" said I, \" that your mother had just grounds for being angry with you.\" After this he entered an action in the Centumviral Court a<^ainst the remaining co-heirs, but not against me. The day of the trial was approaching. ]\\Iy co-heirs were desirous of coming to a settlement and compromising the matter, not from any distrust of their cause, but from fear of the times.* They were afraid of what they saw had happened to many, that as the result of a trial before the Centumviri they might be capitally indicted. And, in truth, there were among them some who might have had their friendship both for Gratilla and Eusticus cast in their teeth. They begged me to have a talk with Curianus. \"We met in the Temple of Concord. There, \" If your mother,\" said I, \" had left you heir to a fourth part of her property, pray, could you have complained ? t What if, though she had instituted you heir to the whole, she had so diminished the amount by bequests that no more than a fourth part remained to you ? You ought then to be satisfied if, after being disinherited by your mother, you receive a fourth part from her heirs, which, however, I will add to. You are aware that you entered no action against me, and that by this time two years have expired, so that I have obtained a right to my whole share in * The times of Domitian. The ex- t This -would have been all he pression is sufficiently explained by would have been legally entitled to. what follows. It was his legitima poriio. K virtue of uninterrupted enjoyment. But that my co-lieirs may find you more conformable, and in order that you may lose nothing by the respect you showed for me, I make you the same offer on account of my share.\" I enjoyed the recompense not only of a good conscience, but of a good report. So now this very Curianus has left me a legacy, signalising this action of mine (which, if I do not flatter myself, was one in the ancient spirit) by a remarkable compliment. All this I have written to you, because it is my habit to confer with you, just as with myself, about everything which either pleases or pains me ; and, further, it seemed hard to defraud you, who are so attached to me, of the pleasure I was myself enjoying. Nor indeed am I such a sage that it makes no difference to me if such actions of mine as I believe to have been honourable are attended by some ratification and, if I may so speak, reward. (2.) To Calpurnius Flaccus. I have received your splendid thrushes,* a present for which I can make no adequate return, either from the resources of the city, since I am at my Laurentine villa, or from the sea, owing to the dirty weather. You will receive then, in return, this jejune note, quite outspoken in its ingratitude, and which does not even imitate that famous cunning of Diomed in exchanging presents.f However, such is your good-nature, you will pardon it all the more readily in that it confesses it deserves no pardon. * Or, fieldfares {turdos). I believe + Alluding to the story in the the modern Italians call all small Iliad where Diomed receives from birds of this kind \"tordi.\" Glaucus arms of gold in exchange for arms of brass. (30 To TiTius Aeisto. Many kind offices have you done me which have been welcome and agreeable to me, but this especially that you have thought it right not to conceal from me how, at your house, there has been a considerable and detailed discussion on the subject of my trifles in verse, which, owing to dif- ferences of opinion, was carried to a great length. There were some even, it seems, who, while not actually condemning these productions in themselves, yet found fault with me, in a kindly and outspoken way, for writing and reciting them. To these, at the risk of adding to my sin, I give this reply. I do sometimes compose trifles in verse, of a not very grave character : I own to it ; and so too I listen to comedians, and go to see actors in farces, and read lyric poets, and appreciate productions in the style of Sotades ; * sometimes, moreover, I indulge in laughter, in jokes, in play, andto include in one term every species of harmless recreation -I am a man. Now, certainly, I cannot be offended at there being such an opinion of my character that persons should wonder at my writing these things who are ignorant of the fact that the most highly cultivated, most respectable, and most virtuous men have frequently scribbled in the same way. Yet from those who do know what authorities I follow, and how great they are, I am confident that I shall easily obtain leave to err, provided it be in company with those whose sportive productions, as well as their serious actions, may be imitated with approval. Shall I be afraid (I won't name any living person, for fear of exposing my- self to any appearance of flattery), but shall I be afraid that that is not quite becoming to me which became M. TuUius, C. Calvus, Asinius Pollio, M. Messala, Q. Horten-* A Greek poet who wrote loose verses. sius, M. Brutus, L. Sulla, Q. Catulus, Q. Scsevola, Ser. Sulpicius, M. Varro, Torquatus, nay the Torquati, C. Memmius, Lentulus Gsetulicus, Annseus Seneca, Annseus Lucanus, and recently Verginius Eufus ; or, if examples short of imperial * do not suffice, the Emperor Julius, the Emperor Augustus, the Emperor Nerva, Tiberius Ctesar ? Nero, indeed, I pass over, though aware that a practice is not tainted by being sometimes shared in by bad people, hut continues to be respectable in that it is frequently employed by the virtuous. Among the latter must be especially numbered P. Vergilius, Cornelius Nepos, and, before them, Accius and Ennius. These, it is true, were not Senators, but purity of character knows no distinction of ranks. However, I recite too ; and I do not know whether those who have been named did this or not. Very good. But they might well be content with their own judgment, while my self-consciousness is too modest for me to think a thing sufficiently perfect because it is approved by myself. Ac- cordingly, I am led to recite by these incentives ; first, because he who recites will apply himself with a some- what keener attention to what he writes, out of regard for his audience ; next, because he will be able to decide on points which are doubtful, by virtue as it were of the decision of a council. Again, he will receive many hints from many persons ; and even if he do not receive them, he will ascertain the sentiments of individual hearers, by their expression, their eyes, a nod of the head, a gesture of the hands, their silence eventhings which distinguish one's real opinion from mere complaisance by sufficiently evident signs. And accordingly, if by chance any one of those who were present as hearers shall care to read what he has heard, he will see that I have either altered or left out certain portions, perhaps actually in accordance with * Exempla privata. Privatus, in to a sovereign. Originally, a person Pliny's time, meant generally what who was not in a public office, we should call \"a subject \" as opposed BOOK V. 149 his judgment, though he may himself have said nothing to me. But I am arguing all this as though it had been my habit to invite the public to a lecture-room instead of some friends into my chamber ; yet to have friends in great numbers is a glory to many and a subject of reprehension to none. (4.) To Julius Valepjanus. Here is a matter, small in itself, but the prelude to no small one. SoUers, a man of Prsetorian rank, petitioned the Senate to be allowed to establish periodical markets on his estate. Delegates from Vicentia spoke in opposi- tion to this. Tuscilius ISTominatus assisted them, and the cause was adjourned. At another meeting of the Senate, the people from Vicentia appeared without an advocate, saying, that they had been \"deceived\"either a hasty expression, or else they really thought so. On being questioned by Nepos the Praetor as to whom they had instructed, they replied, the same person as before. Further questioned as to whether he had assisted them gratuitously on that occasion, they replied that he had received six thousand sesterces.* Had they given him anything be- yond this ? A thousand denarii, f they said. ISTepos pro- posed that Nominatus should be summoned before the Senate. So much for that day ; but as far as I can prog- nosticate, the matter will go further. For there are many things which, if they be only just touched or in the least set in motion, will imperceptibly spread themselves over a very wide surface, I have pricked up your ears for you ! How long and how cajolingly will you have to beg, to learn the sequel ? if indeed, you do not antedate your coming to Eome on account of this very matter, preferring to see with your own eyes, rather than read about it. * About ;^48. t About £2,1- ISO PLINY'S LETTERS. (5-) To Nonius Maximus. The death of G. Fannius has been announced to me, and this announcement has been to me a grievous shock, because, in the first place, I had a great affection for that man of taste and learning, and further, because I was in the habit of profiting by his judgment. He was indeed by nature acute, as well as practised by experience, and his sincerity made him ever ready. Besides these considerations, I am pained by the circumstances of his death : he has died with his old will in force, leaving out those whom he most regarded, and benefiting those with whom he was displeased. This, however, might be in some way endurable ; what is more serious is, that he has left an admirable work unfinished. For, though closely occupied by his practice at the bar, he was, nevertheless, engaged in writing of the ends of those who had been either put to death or banished by Nero. He had already completed three books, composed with taste and diligence, in pure Latin, and in a style midway between that of conversation and history ; and he was the more desirous of getting the remaining books completed, in consequence of the previous ones having found a number of eager readers. To me, however, the deaths of those who are preparing something immortal seem, in all cases, untimely and immature. For as to those who, given over to pleasures, live as it were for the day, these complete every day the purpose for which they exist. Those, on the other hand, who contemplate pos- terity, and extend the memory of themselves by their worksto these no death can be other than sudden, since it always breaks off something which has been initiated. Gains Fannius, indeed, had long foreseen the event. BOOK V. 151 In a dream at night he seemed to himself to be reclining on his sofa, disposed in an attitude for study, with his case of books before him (as was his habit) : presently he dreamt that Nero came in and seated himself on the couch, and, taking out the first book which he (Fannius) had published on the subject of his crimes, turned over the leaves to the end ; then, that he did the same with the second and third books ; finally, that he departed. He was greatly alarmed, interpreting this to mean that he was destined to come to an end of his writing at the place where Nero made an end of reading, and so it turned out. On recalling this, a feeling of commiseration comes over me to think what vigils, what labours, have been expended by him in vain. My mortal condition, my own writings, present themselves to my mind. Nor do I doubt that you too will be alarmed, by the same kind of reflection, for those things which you have in hand. So then, while life suffices, let us set to work, that death may have as little as possible to destroy. (6.) To DoMiTius Apollinaris. I was much pleased with your care and soKcitude on my account, when, on hearing that I was about to repair to my Tuscan estate, in summer, you dissuaded me from doing so at a time when you deem it unhealthy. It is true that the side of Tuscany, which extends along the coast, is unwholesome and pestilential ; but this property of mine is a long way from the sea, and, moreover, under- lies the Apennine range, the most salubrious of mountains. And further, that you may lay aside all fear on my ac- count, let me tell you about the character of the climate, the situation of the country, and the charms of my villa. It will be a pleasure to you to hear of these things, and to me to relate them. JS2 PLINY'S LETTERS. The climate in winter is cold and frosty, unfavourable and indeed fatal to myrtles and olive-trees, and everything else which delights in continuous warmth ; yet it is toler- ant of laurels, and in fact brings on very fine ones, some- times, it is true, killing them off, yet not more frequently than happens in the neighbourhood of Eome. The summers are wonderfully soft, the air is always stirred by a kind of breath ; yet it is more often breezy than windy. Hence, old men are numerous, you may see the grand- fathers and great grandfathers of youths already grown, you may hear old stories and old folks' talk, and when you visit the place you may fancy yourself born in another age. The lie of the country is charming : imagine a kind of amphitheatre of immense size, and such as nature alone can construct. A broad and spreading plain is surrounded by mountains ; the mountains on their highest summits are crowned with lofty and venerable forests, and in these there is game in plenty and variety. Next to these are woods for cutting, following the downward slope of the mountain ; and interspersed with them are rich and loamy knolls (indeed a stone does not readily present itself anywhere, even if you look for one) which do not yield in point of fertility to the flattest plains, and bring to maturity a rich harvest, though it be a somewhat late one. Below these, vineyards stretch along the whole side of the mountain, and present a uniform appearance far and wide. They are terminated, or fringed so to speak at the base, by shrubberies. Then come meadows and corn- fields, fields which can be broken up only by the largest oxen and the strongest ploughs : the soil is so stiff and rises up in such huge clods when first cut into, that it is only by a course of nine plough ings that it can finally be reduced. The meadows, gemmed with flowers, rear the trifolium and other kinds of herbage always soft and tender, and in a manner new ; everything being matured by never-failing streams. Yet, where there is the greatest quantity of water, there is no marsh, because the land, being on an incline, pours into the Tiber all the moisture which it receives and does not absorb. That river runs through the middle of the estate, it is of a size to carry ships, and conveys the whole of our produce to Eome, that is to say, in winter and spring ; in summer it is lowered, and leaves the name of a large river to a dry channel ; in autumn it resumes its character. You would be greatly charmed if you viewed this situation from the mountains ; you would fancy yourself looking not at so much country, but at a kind of landscape painted with the most exquisite beauty : such is the variety, such the harmonious disposi- tion, which refreshes the eye wherever it turns. My villa commands as good a view of what lies under the hill as though it were on the summit ; so gentle and gradual is the unperceived rise to it that you find you have made an ascent, without knowing that you have been ascending. At its back it has the Apennines, but some way off. From these it enjoys breezes, however calm and un- ruffled the day, not sharp or cutting ones, however, but such as are softened and broken by the mere space they have passed over. It has, for the most part, a southerly aspect, and invites -if I may so speakinto a broad and slightly projecting cloister the summer sun from the sixth hour, the winter sun rather earlier. In this cloister there are several apartments, and a hall, too, after the ancient fashion. In . front of the cloister is a variegated terrace walk, with borders of box, then a descent to a sloping garden bank, with forms of animals cut out in box facing each other. On the Bat ground is an acanthus so soft that I had almost called it liquid. Eound this is a walk, enclosed by ever- greens planted close, and cut into different shapes. Beyond this is a promenade in the form of a ring, wliich encircles the variously shaped boxes and the low trimmed shrubs. All this is protected by a wall covered and con- cealed by a sloping hedge of box. Then comes a green expanse not less worthy to be viewed for its natural than what has been above mentioned for its artificial beauties. There are fields further on and many other green meads and coppices. Prom the extremity of the cloister a dining-room pro- jects. Through its folding doors it looks out on the end of the terrace walk, and straight on the green expanse and a large extent of country ; from its windows, in one direction, it commands the side of the terrace walk and the project- ing part of the villa ; in the other, the trees in the riding- school and their foliage. OjDposite to about the middle of the cloister, there is a receding building which encloses a small court shaded by four plane-trees. Among these a fountain gushes forth from an orifice of marble, refreshing with its gentle spray the plane-trees which are disposed around it, and everything underlying them. There is in this building a sleeping-apartment, which excludes day- light and loud noises and even sounds ; and adjoining this a dining-parlour for every-day use and the reception of friends. It commands the small court of which I spoke and the cloister, and the same prospect as that from the cloister. There is also another saloon which enjoys the verdure and shade of a plane-tree close to it, adorned with marble to the height of the window openings, and above this with wall-paintings which in beauty do not yield to the marble ; they represent trees, and birds sitting on the trees. There is a small fountain in this room, and a basin to the fountain ; around it a number of jets combine to produce a most delightful murmur. At the angle of the cloister a large saloon faces the dining-room. Some of its windows look down on the terrace walk, and others on the paddocks, but first of all upon the piscina, which is an attraction to and underlies the windows, and is a pleasant object to the ear as well as the eye, for the water rushes down from a height and foams as it strikes on the marble bottom. This same saloon is extremely warm in winter time, owing to its being penetrated by a great quantity of sunlight. A heating-room is attached to it, %vhich, on BOOK V. 155 cloudy days, supplies the place of the sun by the warm air it pours in. Next to this a roomy and cheerful dress- ing-room conducts you to the cold-bathing apartment, where there is a large and sheltered plunging-bath. If you wish to swim more at your ease, or in warmer water, there is a piscine in the court and a reservoir hard by, where you may brace yourself afresh if you have had too much of the warmth. With the cold bath-room is con- nected one of medium temperature, which is particularly favoured by the sun ; this is still more the case with the hot bath-room, for it is projecting. In this there are three tiers of baths, two enjoying the sun, the third less warm, but not less lifrht. Over the dressing-room is the tennis- court, large enough for several kinds of games and several parties of players. Not far from the bath is a staircase which leads to a covered cloister, first of all, however, to three parlours. One overlooks the little court in which are the four plane-trees, another the paddocks, the third the vineyards, so that each has a different aspect as weK as prospect. At the upper end of the covered cloister is a saloon cut out of the cloister itself, which commands the riding-school, the vineyards, and the mountains. Adjoining this is another saloon exposed to the sun, especially in winter. Next comes an apartment which connects the villa with the riding-school. Such are the appearance and the arrangement of the house in front. At the side is a covered cloister for summer use, situated on a rising ground, which seems not so much to look upon the vineyards as to be touching them. In the centre of this, a dining-room receives a very wholesome air from the Apennine valleys ; behind, it admits, as one may say, the vineyards through windows of great size, and the same vineyards, through its folding doors, viewed along the cloister. On the side of this dining-room, on which there are no windows, a staircase serves for introducing what is necessary for the repast, by a more private entrance. At the end is a saloon, to whicli the cloister itself furnishes a prospect no less agreeable than the vineyards. Underneath is another cloister, which resembles an underground one. In summer it is extremely cool, and, sufficiently supplied with air of its own, is neither in want of nor admits the external atmosphere. After the two cloisters, at the point where the dining-room ends, a colonnade begins, with a winter temperature before midday and a summer one in the afternoon. This forms the approach to two suites of rooms, in one of which are four saloons, and in the other three ; and these, as the sun goes round, enjoy either the sunshine or the shade. The disposition and charms of the villa are, however, far surpassed by the riding-ground, an open expanse which presents itself in its entirety to your eyes the moment you enter it. It is surrounded by plane-trees, and these are clothed with ivy, so that the tops of them are green with their own leaves, and the lower parts with the leaves of the other. The ivy creeps over trunk and branches, and links together neighbouring planes in its passage. The interstices are filled by box. The exterior boxes are encircled by laurels which add their shade to that of the planes. The straight line of the riding-ground is broken at the extreme end by a semicircle, so as to present a different appearance. This is surrounded and protected by cypresses, and thus darkened and obscured by a deeper shade ; but the inner circles (for there are several of them) enjoy the clearest day. Hence, too, they bear roses, and produce a diversion from the cool shade by their pleasant sunniness. At the end of these winding ways, with their varied and diversified character, comes the straight road again, and not one only, for a number of paths are separated from each other by intervening boxes. At one point a lawn, at another point the box itself comes in, cut into a thou- sand shapes, sometimes into those of letters, which give you here the name of the owner, there that of the artist ; sometimes every other one rises in the form of a small BOOK V. 157 pyramid, and its neighbour has an apple-tree planted in the middle of it, an unexpected imitation as it were of the rustic introduced into an object which smacks a good deal of the town. A space in the middle is ornamented on both sides by dwarf plane-trees. Beyond, there is an acanthus, pliant and flexible in all directionsthen more figures and more names. At the top is a semicircular seat of white marble, shaded by a vine ; the vine is supported by four small columns of Carystian marble. From this seat water gushes forth through tiny pipes, just as if it were set in motion by the weight of the persons reclining. It is collected in the hollowed rock, and deposited in a polished marble basin, being so regulated by a hidden contrivance, as to fill without overflowing it. My pic-nic tray and the heavier part of my dinner-service are placed on the edge of the basin, the lighter parts make the round of the water, floating in the form of little boats and birds. On the other side is a fountain which projects water and receives it again ; for, after being propelled to a height, it falls back on the same place, being absorbed and emitted through orifices which communicate with each other. Eight opposite the seat is a saloon which reflects as much ornament on the seat as it derives from it. It is resplendent with marble, its folding-doors project into the shrubbery, and from its upper and lower windows it looks down upon and up to other shrubberies. Next comes a retreating cabinet, a part as it were and yet not a part of the saloon. Here there is a couch, and windows on every side, yet the light is obscured by the depth of the shade ; for a luxurious vine scrambles and mounts up the whole building to the roof. You may He here just as if you were in a grove, the only difference being that you will not feel the showers as you would in a grove. Here, too, a foun- tain rises and immediately disappears. At many points marble seats are disposed, as resting to the weary walker as the saloon itself could be. Small fountains adjoin the seats. Throughout the whole of the riding-ground there are gurgling streams introduced, by means of pipes, follow- ing the lead of man's hand ; by the aid of these the various shrubs are watered at different times and sometimes all of them together. I should long since have avoided the imputation of loquacity, had I not determined to go round every corner of the place with you in my letter. Nor was I afraid that you would be wearied with reading of that which you would not weary of seeing in person ; especially as you might rest between whiles, if so disposed, and laying down the letter, often take a seat, so to speak. Besides I have indulged my partiality ; for I am partial to what was in great part laid out by myself or completed by me after it had been laid out. To sum up (for why not freely inform you of my opinion, it may be my mistaken one ?), I deem it the first duty of a writer to read over his title and from time to time ask himself what it was that he undertook to write about, feeling sure that if he only sticks to his subject he will not be tedious, while he will be very tedious indeed if he goes in quest of or drags in any foreign matter. You see the number of lines in which Homer and Virgil describe, the one the arms of ^neas, the other those of Achilles ; yet each of them is brief, because he is only doing what he proposed to do. You see how Aratus follows up and catalogues even the tiniest stars : yet he observes the bounds : here is no digression on his part, it is the very work he has to do. Similarly, in my case (to compare small things with great), when I am endeavouring to set the whole of my villa before your eyes, provided I say nothing alien to the subject and as it were out of the way, it is not the letter which gives the descrip- tion, but the villa which is described, that is of great size. However, to return to my starting-point, for fear of being justly censured in accordance with my own rule, if I go further with this digression of mine; you now know why I prefer my Tuscan property to those at Tusculum, BOOK V. 159 Tibur, and Prseneste. For in addition to what has been mentioned, the retirement there is more complete, more snug, and consequently less liable to interruption. There is no need to put on one's toga ; nobody wants you in the neighbourhood ; everything is calm and quiet ; and this in itself adds to the healthiness of the locality no less than the brightness of the sky and the clearness of the atmosphere. Here, both mentally and bodily, I am in especial vigour ; for my mind I exercise by study, and my body by the chase. My household too are nowhere in better health. Up to this time, at any rate, I have not lost there a single person among those whom I brought out with me (may no harm come of my saying so !). May the gods continue for the future this, which is a joy to me and a glory to the place. (7-) To Calvisius Eufus. It is plain that a community can neither be constituted heir-at-law, nor take preferentially. Yet Saturninus, who has left us his executors,* has given a fourth part of his property to our community, -f-and subsequently, in lieu of this fourth, a preferential legacy of four hundred thousand sesterces. % This, if you look to the law, is null and void ; if to the intention of the deceased, it is valid and not to be upset. Now, to my way of thinking, the intention of the deceased (I am apprehensive how the lawyers may take what I am going to say) is of higher import than the letter of the law, particularly in the case of what it was intended should go to our common birth-place. Could I, who have bestowed on it eleven hundred thousand sesterces § out of my own purse, refuse to this community * Heredes. The sense of executor-monwealtli (commune) the corpora- ship being proniinent here, I have tion of the town, preferred the word which signifies J About _^32oo. it. § About ;|/^88oo. Undecies : another t Reipuhllcac nostrae, to our com-reading is sedecies. a •windfall of four hundred thousand, or little more than a third of the above amount ? I am sure that you, in particular, will not be opposed to my judgment, seeing that like an admirable citizen you cherish this same birth- place of ours. I should wish then that, the next time the town-council come together, you would point out to them the law of the case, briefly however and quietly ; then add that we make them a present of the four hundred thousand sesterces, in accordance with Saturninus's in- junctions. His be the gift, his the liberality ; let our part be styled compliance merely. I have desisted from writing all this publicly, first because I remembered that the closeness of our friendship, and the strength of your own perspicuity, would make it your duty as well as put it in your power to speak for me as well as yourself ; next because I feared that the proper mean, which it will be easy for you to preserve when speaking, might seem not to have been observed in a letter. For a speech receives its tone from the expression, the gestures, the voice itself, which accompany it ; while a letter, being destitute of all such commendations, is exposed to the malignity of its interpreters. (8.) To TiTiNius Capito. You advise me to write a history, and you are not singular in giving this advice. Many persons, at many times, have urged me to the same effect ; and for my part I am willing to do so, not from any confidence that the work will be easy to me (it would be rash to suppose this, un- less one had tried), but because it seems in a high degree noble not to allow those to perish who have merited im- mortality, and to extend the fame of others in company with one's own. Moreover, to me there is no inducement so strong as the love and longing for an enduring fame, a longing in every way worthy of a man, especially of one BOOK V. i6i who is conscious of no guilt, and hence does not dread being remembered by posterity. So by day, and night too, I ponder -\" By what fair means to raise my grovelling name.\" Eor this would satisfy my wishes. The rest would be beyond my wishes -\" To flit a victor through the lips of men.\" * \" Yet, oh ! \" t However, the former suffices me ; and this, historical com- position seems almost alone to promise. For an oration or a poem meets with small favour, unless it be in the loftiest style, whereas a history pleases in whatever way it is written; since men are by nature inquisitive, and charmed at being made acquainted with events in the barest fashion, being indeed often led away by even small stories and tales. In my case, I am further impelled to this pursuit by an example in my own family; my maternal uncle, who was also my father by adoption, wrote histories, and with the most religious care too. Now, I find it stated by the sages that it is a noble thing to follow in the footsteps of one's ancestors, provided only the way they have gone before you was the right one. Why hesi- tate? I have pleaded in great and important causes. These speeches of mine (though with but slender hopes from them) I propose to revise, lest the results of such great toil should perish with me, if I fail to bestow this remaining attention on them ; for to those who take account of posterity, whatever is not perfected is as though it had never been begun. You will say, \"You can rewrite your speeches and compose a history at the same tanced, cries out -importance that it is more than enough to accomplish one of them. I began to speak in the rorum in my nineteenth year, and only now perceive, yet still through a mist, what is required of an orator. What if to such a burden a fresh one be added? No doubt an oration and a history have much that is common; they have, however, still more numerous diversities, and precisely in those points which seem to be common to them. Both are in the way of narra- tion, but in a different style. In the one case, simple, common, every-day language is mostly suitable ; in the other, there should be everywhere profundity, brilliancy, and elevation. The one is in general all bone, muscle, and sinew ; the other requires to be set off by fleshly integuments and, if I may so express it, a flowing crest. The one pleases, above all, by its vigour, its incisiveness, its persistency ; the other by its expansiveness and gentleness, and even sweetness. In short, the language is different ; the tone and the style of composition are different. For there is a wide distinction, as Thucjdides has it, between ['a permanent possession\" and \"a contest for a prize.\" An oration is the latter, a history is the former .^F or these reasons, I am not tempted to mix up and confound two matters so dissimilar, and which their very importance dis- tinguishes from each other ; fearing that I should lose my head in such a medley, so to speak, and be found writing in one place what I ought to be writing in the other. So I must, in the interim (to adhere to my own phraseology), ask the Court for an adjournment. Do you, however, at once consider what epoch I had best attack. An ancient one, written of by others ? Here the materials for investi- gation would be at hand, but the collation of them would be arduous.* Or a period as yet unhandled and recent ? Here the risk of offence would be great, the success to be obtained slight. For besides that, in view of the great * Onerosa collatio. Some take this writers.\" The plain sense, however, to mean, \" I should have to stand an is that given in the text, unpleasant, comparison with former BOOK V. 163 corruption of mankind, there are more subjects for censure than for praise, there is this, that, where you praise, you will be said to be niggardly, and where you censure, to be extravagant ; though you may have been most lavish in the former case, and most sparing in the latter. But these considerations do not restrain me. I have sufficient courage on behalf of the truth. What I ask is that you would prepare the way for the undertaking you advise, by selecting a subject, lest, now that I am quite prepared to write, there should arise afresh some new and valid ground for hesitation and delay. (9.) To KuFus. I had gone down to the Basilica Julia, to listen to those whom it was my duty to reply to at the next ad- journment of the Court. The judges were sitting, the decemvirs had come in, the advocates were in full view, there was a long silence. At length came a message from the Prsetor. The Centumviri were dismissed, and pro- ceedings suspended for the day ; to my delight, who am never so well prepared as not to be rejoiced at a delay. The reason for the adjournment was that Nepos the Praetor is conducting an investigation in accordance with the law. He had put forth a short edict, in which he warned prosecutors and defendants as well, that he should carry out the provisions of the Senate's decree. The decree in question was appended to the edict. It ordered everybody who was engaged in legal pro- ceedings to make oath before litigating, that he had not given, promised, or guaranteed anything to any one in return for his advocacy. Such were the words, and a number of others besides, by which the sale and barter of advocacy were forbidden. However, at the termination of the suit, it permitted money to be given, to the extent of ten thousand sesterces.* The Preetor who presides * About ;^8o. over Centumviral causes was perplexed by this action of Nepos, and, with the view of deliberating whether he should follow the precedent, gave us an unexpected holi- day. Meanwhile, the edict of Nepos is either carped at or praised through the whole city. Many say, \" So then we have found a man to make crooked things straight ! \"What ? were there no Prsetors before this one ? Pray, who is this personage who purifies public morals ? \" Others retort, \" He has done perfectly right. Before assuming office, he took cognisance of the law, and read the Senate's decrees ; now, he checks bargains which are dis- graceful in the extreme, and will not allow what is a most noble avocation to be the subject of barter.\" Such are the opinions expressed, which will prevail on one side or the other, according to the event. For though it is alto- gether unfair, yet it is a received usage, that designs whether creditable or scandalous, according as they turn out successful or unsuccessful, are proportionately either approved or blamed. Hence often the self-same actions are styled by the denomination, now of prudent zeal, now of self-seeking, sometimes of boldness, and at other times of insanity. (10.) To Suetonius Teanquillus. Pray at length discharge the engagement entered into by my hendecasyllabic verses, which guaranteed our com- mon friends some writings from your pen. These verses are being daily called upon and dunned, and there is some danger of their being served with a notice to produce.* I myself am given to hesitation in the matter of publishing, but you have surpassed even my dilatoriness and tardi- ness. Accordingly either break off delay at once, or have a care lest these same writings, which my hendecasyllables * He is in these opening sentences jocularly using the language of the courts. BOOK V. 165 can't get out of you by caresses, be extorted by tbe severe handling of my iambic trimeters.* Your work is per- fected and completed : your critical file is no longer bright ; on the contrary, it is being worn with use. Suffer me to see your title, suffer me to hear that the volumes of my friend Tranquillus are being copied out and read and sold. It is right, when our love is so mutual, that I should derive from you the same pleasure as you enjoy from me. (rr.) To Calpuknius Fabatus, his Wife's Gkandfather. I have received your letter, from which I learn that you have dedicated to the use of the public a very handsome arcade, in your own name and that of your son ; also that, on the following day, you promised a sum of money for the ornamentation of its doors, in order that your gene- rosity might take a fresh departure by crowning what had gone before. I rejoice, first of all, on account of your own glory, some portion of which must, in consequence of our connection, redound to my credit ; next, because I see that the memory of my father-in-law is being prolonged by public constructions of so noble a character; lastly, be- cause our native place is flourishing, and while it would be a pleasure to me that it should be adorned by any one, it is a subject of the greatest delight that this should be done by you in particular. It only remains for me to pray the gods that they may continue this disposition to you, and give you as long a time as possible for its exer- cise. For I am sure it will happen that as soon as you have completed what you lately promised, you will begin upon something else. Generosity indeed when once set in motion is unable to stand still, and the very exercise of it enhances its charms. i66 PLINY'S LETTERS. (12.) To Teeentius Scaueus. Intending to read aloud a short oration, which I have thoughts of publishing, I invited some friends, in order to excite my diffidence, but only a few, in order to hear the truth. For I have two reasons for reciting : one, that I may be stimulated by apprehension ; the other, that I may be admonished in case anything chances to escape me, as being my own work. I was gratified in my desire, and found persons to place their advice at my disposal. Further, on my own account, I noted some things for correction ; and have corrected the book and sent it to you. You will learn the subject from the title, the rest the book itself will explain; and indeed the time has now come when it must accustom itself to be intelligible without any prefatory remarks. Please to write me your opinion of the whole as well as of the parts. For I shall be either more cautious in the way of keeping it back, or more emboldened to publish it, according as your authority shall be added in one direction or the other. (13) To Valeeianus. You ask of me, and I promised in case you asked, to write you word of the issue of Nepos's proposal with regard to Tuscilius Nominatus.* Nominatus was introduced, and pleaded his own cause in person, no one appearing to prosecute ; for the agents from Vicentia not only refrained from pressing him, but actually assisted him. The substance of his defence was that his courage, and not his honour, had failed him in his office of advocate ; that he had come down with the intention of speaking and had even been seen in court ; that he had subsequently retired, frightened by the observations of his friends ; for they had * See Letter 4 of this book. BOOK V. i6 advised him not to offer such a pertinacious resistance to the wishes of a Senator (especially in the Senate) whose contention seemed no longer about markets merely, but concerning his own influence, reputation, and dignity ; that, otherwise, he would be exposed to still greater odium than was recently the case. And in truth, on the former occa- sion, some cries had been raised against him, though only by a few however, as he left the court.* He supplemented all this with prayers and a quantity of tears : indeed throughout the whole of his speech this practised pleader took pains to appear rather as one entreating forgiveness (certainly the more popular and safer course), than as if defending himself. He was acquitted on the motion of Afranius Dexter, consul elect, the substance of which was to the effect that, while Nominatus would certainly have done better if he had carried through the cause of the Vicetians in the same spirit as that in which he had undertaken it ; yet, as he had fallen into this kind of error with no fraudulent intent, and was proved to have committed nothing worthy of punishment, he ought to be discharged, on condition of returning his fees to the Vicetians. This was assented to by all, with the exception of Fabius Aper, who proposed that Nominatus should be disbarred for five years, and though he could not carry any one by his authority, he remained fixed in his opinion. More than this, after citing the law on the subject of convening the Senate, he insisted that Dexter, who had originated the opposite proposal, should make oath \" that what he had proposed was in the interest of the State.\" Though this demand was in accordance with law, yet several cried out against it as seeming to charge corrupt motives on the mover. However, before the votes of the Senate were given, Nigrinus, a tribune of the people, read out an * Adclamatum eratexeunti. Doer-leaving the court, i.e., for throwing ing, taking adclamatum in its more up his brief. But this is very round- usual sense, understands this to mean about. And, moreover, adclamare is that several persons on the former not so unusual as D. thinks, in an un- occasion applauded Nominatus for favourable sense. eloquent and weighty memorial in which he complained that the office of advocate was sold, that even the interests of clients were fraudulently sold, that corrupt engagements were entered into in the matter of trials, and that large and fixed incomes derived from the spoils of citizens had replaced the pursuit of glory. He read out the titles of certain laws, and appealed to the authority of decrees of the Senate ; in conclusion he declared that our most excellent Prince ought to be requested, since the laws and the decrees of the Senate were thus contemned, to take upon himself to remedy these monstrous abuses. After a few days, came a rescript from the Emperor, severe yet moderate withal. You can read the original : it is in the Gazette. How glad I am that in conducting my cases I have always declined, not only compacts, presents, and fees, but even trifling cadeaux. To be sure it is one's duty to shun what is dishonourable, not as being unlawful, but as being shameful ; yet at the same time it is pleasant to see a thing publicly prohibited which one has never per- mitted oneself. Probably, nay, certainly, the credit of this resolve of mine will be smaller, its fame dimmer, when every one will have to do from necessity what I did of my own accord. Meanwhile, I enjoy real pleasure when some of my friends jocosely call me \"a diviner,\" others declare that \" a check has been put on my plunder- ing and avarice ! \" o ( 140To Pontius. I was rusticating at Comum when it was announced to me that Cornutus Tertullus was appointed Curator of the Via -Emilia. It is impossible to express the pleasure experienced by me, both on his and my account; on his because, though he may be, as certainly he is, far removed from every kind of ambition, yet an honour spontaneously conferred must needs be agreeable to him; on mine, BOOK V. 169 because the office entrusted to me gives me no inconsider- able additional pleasure when I see a similar one bestowed on Cornutus.* For, to be advanced in dignity is not more grateful than to be put on a par with good men. And where is there a better man than Cornutus ? Or a more virtuous ? Or one more closely moulded to the pattern of antiquity in every species of good repute ? All which was known to me not from fame onlygreat and merited of itself as is the fame which he enjoysbut from a long and intimate experience of him. We love in unison, and have loved in unison, almost all those of either sex whom our epoch has produced as worthy of imitation ; a partner- ship in friendships which has bound us together in the closest intimacy. To this has been superadded the tie of a public connection ; he was, as you know, my colleague (as though accorded to my prayers) in the Prsefectureship of the treasury, and also in the Consulship. Then it was that I thoroughly ascertained what sort of man, and how great a man he was, as I followed him in the capacity of magistrate, and venerated him in that of a parent ; which was what he deserved, not so much from maturity of years as of character. For these reasons, I congratulate myself as well as him, and on public as much as on private grounds : since now at last men's virtues advance them, not as formerly to posts of danger, but to posts of honour. But my letter would never end, if I were to indulge my joy. I must rather turn to what I was doing here when the announce- ment reached me. I was with my wife's grandfather, and her aunt, with friends long desired ; I was going the round of my farms, listening to a number of rustic complaints, looking over accounts, against the grain, and superficially, (for very different are the papers and the writings with which I am conversant) I had, moreover, begun to make preparations for returning to Eome, being bound by the narrow limits of my leave of absence, and this very news * Pliny was at this time a Commissioner of the Tiber. \"whicli reaches my ears of the office conferred on Cornutus reminds me of my own. I trust your Campania will be sending you back about the same time, that, on my return to town, no day may be lost to our friendly intercourse. (15.) To Arkius Antoninus. It is on trying to imitate your verses, that I experience most strongly how excellent they are. For just as painters can seldom make a portrait of a lovely and exquisite face that does not fall short of the original, so do I trip and fall away from such an archetype. All the more then do I exhort you to favour us with as many as possible of these productions, such as all will be eager, and very few, if any, will be able to imitate. (i6.) To Marcellinus. I write this to you in great distress. The younger daughter of our friend Fundanus is dead. She was a young lady than whom I never saw a livelier or a more lovable, or one more worthy not only of a longer life, but wellnigh of immortality. She had not yet completed her fourteenth year, and already she had the judgment of a woman of advanced age, and the gravity of a matron, and yet girlhood's sweetness, too, coupled with maidenly reserve. How she was wont to hang on her father's neck ! How lov- ingly and, at the same time, modestly she used to embrace us, her father's friends ! How she cherished her nurses, and governors, and tutors, according to their several offices ! How studiously and intelligently she read ! How sparing and guarded she was in her recreations ! With what self- restraint, what patience, aye, what intrepidity did she bear her last illness ! She obeyed the doctors, encouraged her sister and her father, and sustained herself, after her bodily strengtli had failed, by the force of her will. This lasted her to the end, and was not shaken either by the length of her illness or by the fear of death, so as to leave us still more numerous and weighty grounds for our regret and our sorrow. What an altogether sad and premature decease ! And the time of her death was still more cruel than death itself. For she was already betrothed to an admirable young man ; already a day had been fixed upon for the nuptials ; we, the guests, were already invited. What joy turned to what mourning ! I cannot express in words how my soul was wounded on hearing Fundanus himselfin the way that grief is fruitful in discovering assravationsordering that the sum he had intended to pay for dresses and pearls and jewellery should be laid out on incense and unguents and perfumes. He to be sure is a man of culture and philosophy, having devoted himself from his earliest years to profound studies and sciences ; but now he despises all the topics which he has so often listened to and himself uttered, and, throwing to the winds the other virtues, is engrossed in his paternal affection. You will pardon, you will even praise him, if you think of what he has lost. He has lost a daughter who resembled him in character no less than in countenance and expres- sion, who was a marvellously faithful copy of her father in all respects. If, then, you should chance to be writing to him on the subject of a sorrow so legitimate, mind and give him some consolation, not in the chiding style, not too heroic, but gentle and friendly. The lapse of time which will have intervened will do much towards making him receive this more readily ; for just as a wound, still raw, shrinks from the hands of those who would treat it, yet afterwards submits to and itself invites them, so a mental sorrow, when fresh, rejects and flies from consola- tions, yet presently it yearns for them, and is calmed by their gentle application. ( 170To Spurinna. I know how eagerly you favour the polite arts, and how great is your joy whenever young nobles do anything worthy of their ancestors. So I make the more haste to tell you that to-day I formed part of Calpurnius Piso's audience. He recited his \" Legends of the Stars,\" assur- edly an erudite and brilliant theme. It was treated in elegiacs, flowing and tender and smooth, elevated too M'hen the occasion required ; for with much aptness and variety the tone was at one time raised, and lowered at another. He changed from the lofty to the subdued, from brevity to copiousness, from gay to grave, always with the same happy talent. And all this was enhanced by the sweetest of voices, and the voice itself by his modesty. His face was suffused with many a blush and much anxiety, great charms in one who recites. In truth, I know not how it is, but in literary pursuits timidity is more becoming to men than assurance. However, no more : though I would fain say more, and the rather that all this is so handsome on the part of a young man, and so rare on that of a noble. At the close of the recitation, after bestowing a long and hearty embrace on the youth, I incited him by praises -which are the strongest stimulus to encourasrementto go on as he had begun, so as to exhibit, for the guid- ance of his descendants, the same bright light which his ancestors had exhibited to him. I congratulated his ex- cellent mother, and his brother as well, who obtained no less credit from that audience for his fraternal affection than the other son for his eloquence ; in such a marked way did his apprehension, first of all, for his brother while in the act of reciting, and presently his joy, reveal itself. The gods grant that I may often have such news to tell you ! for the age in which we live has my best wishes that it be not sterile and effete ; and I earnestly hope that our nobles may have something in their houses to be admired besides those ancestral images which in the case of these youths seem now to me to be silently applauding and exhorting andwhich is of sufficient account for the glory of both acknowledging them. (18.) To Calpuknius Macee. 'Tis well with me, because it is well with you. You have the company of your wife and of your son ; you are in the enjoyment of the sea, the fresh springs, verdure, the country, and your delicious villa.

For my part I am engaged both in the chase and in lite- rature, on my Tuscan property, sometimes alternately, sometimes doing both together.-j-Nor can I yet pronounce which is the more difficultto catch something, or to write something. \"©• (19.) To Paulinus. Seeing how tenderly you govern your household, I shall the more unreservedly confess to you the indulgence with which I treat my own. There are always present to my mind that Homeric expression -\" He was as a father mild,\" and that term of ours, \" Paterfamilias.\" Yet, were my nature harsher and rougher, it would be softened by the ill-health of my freed-man Zosimus, to whom I am bound to exhibit increased consideration, in that he at present stands in greater need of it. He is an honest and oblig- * Who this was is not known, ment than when he had attained Sulla according to some, Nerva ac-what, to vulgar eyes, is the summit of cording to others.

(says PUny) was happier in his retire- ing man, and a lettered one ; indeed his artand lie miglit as it were be so ticketed *is that of a comedian, and he excels in it. For he delivers himself with spirit, and judgment, appositely and indeed gracefully. He is more- over a clever performer on the guitar, beyond what is required of a comedian. Besides, he reads aloud ora- tions and histories and poetry so well that you would think he had learnt to do nothing else. I have explained this to you carefully, that you might the better know what numerous and what agreeable services he has, in his single person, rendered me. To this must be added my affection for the man, now of long standing and which his very perils have augmented. For nature has so ordered it, that nothing excites and inflames love so much as the fear of bereavement, a fear which I suffer on his account, and not for the first time. For, some years ago, while in the act of delivering himself with effort and emphasis, he spat blood, and in consequence of this having been sent by me to Egypt, he returned lately restored to health, after his long peregrination. Subsequently on putting too great a strain on his voice, for some successive days, though reminded by a slight cough of his old infirmity, he spat blood afresh. For which reason I have decided to send him to the estate which you possess at Forum Julii ; f hav- ing often heard you say that the climate is salubrious and also that there is milk there particularly suited for this kind of cure. I would beg you therefore to write to your people, that the establishment and the house may be open to him ; also that they may contribute to his expenses, if he wants anything ; he will, however, want but little, for he is so economical and temperate that he restricts himself most frugally not only in the matter of indulgences, but even in things necessary for his health. I will give him at his departure a sum sufficient to carry him to your place. * An allusion to the ticket hung f Now^\"Frejus,\" in the South of round the necks of slaves for sale, France, giving their character and qualities. BOOK V. 175 (20.) To Ursus. Once more the Bithynians ! A short time after the affair of Julius Bassus,* they further impeached Eufus Varenus formerly their pro-consul, Varenus whom they had lately themselves applied for, as well as obtained, as their advocate against Bassus. On being introduced into the Senate, they demanded a commission of inquiry. Varenus asked that he, as well as they, might be allowed to compel the attendance of witnesses for the purposes of his defence. The Bithynians demurring to this, the point was debated. I pleaded for Varenus, and not without re- sult, but whether well or ill my book f will show. For in the case of speeches in court, fortune carries the day, either way ; memory, voice, gesture, the particular occa- sion, finally one's affection for, or else detestation of the accused, these are things which greatly detract from, or add to, the commendation they receive ; whereas a book excites neither offence nor partiality, and is independent of accidents whether fortunate or adverse. Fonteius Magnus, one of the Bithynians, replied to me with great abundance of words and much paucity of mat- ter. In most of the Greeks, as in him, volubility takes the place of copiousness : such long and dreary periods do they pour forth at a breath just like a torrent. Hence Julius Candidus says, rather neatly, that eloquence is one thing and loquacity another.j For eloquence is the gift of scarcely here and there one, nay, if we are to believe M. Antonius, of no man ; but this which Candidus calls * See Book VI. Letter 9. fying the English rendering. \" I t The book which he sends -with spoke for Varenus, and (I will just this letter.

The jingle of words can- lihcr indicabit, where the force of not be rendered in English. nam can only be expressed by ampli- loquacity is the special gift of many, and of the most impudent rascals in particular. Next day HomuUus made a clever, spirited, and well- turned speech for Varenus, and Nigrinus replied to him concisely, with force and elegance. Acilius Eufus, consul- elect, moved that the commission of inquiry should be accorded to the Bithynians, while he passed over the application of Varenus in silence. This was a mode of refusing it. Cornelius Prisons, of consular rank, was for granting the request of accusers and accused, and he got a majority. He carried a point which is neither provided for by law nor particularly sanctioned by custom, but a just one nevertheless. Why it is just, I shall refrain from proving in a letter, in order that you may wish for the speech. For if what Homer says be true, that \" Novel lays attract our ravislied ears, But old the mind with inattention hears,\" * I must have a care that the charm of novelty and the bloom which are the principal attractions of that small oration be not prematurely gathered by my letter. (21.) To Satukninus. Your letter affected me in different ways, for its con- tents were partly pleasant and partly sad. What was pleasant was the announcement that you are kept in town. \" I don't wish to be,\" say you ; but / wish it : moreover, the promise that you would have a reading immediately on my arrival. Thank you for waiting for me. The sad part was about Julius Valens lying danger- ously ill ; though even this is hardly so, if it be judged from the point of his own advantage, since it is his interest to be freed as soon as possible from an incurable malady. What, however, was certainly not only sad but actually * Odyssey i. 446, Pope's version. distressing was the news that Julius Avitus has died while returning from his Quaestorshipdied on board ship, far from his loving brother, far from his mother and sisters ! These are circumstances which do not matter to him now he is dead, but they did matter to him when dying, and they do matter to those who remain. This alone is distressing that a young man should have been cut off in the first bloom of such a character as his, a man who would have attained the highest eminence, if his virtues had had time to mature. How ardent was his love for literature ! How much he read and even wrote ! And all this has now perished, together with himself, with- out any fruit in the shape of posthumous fame.* But why indulge in grief, to which everything furnishes the richest material, if you once abandon the reins to it ? I must make an end of my letter, so as to make an end at the same time of the tears which the letter has called forth. * Fosteritas, here \" fame with posterity,\" as in Book II. i. M ( 178 ) BOOK VI. To TiEO. So long as I was on the other side of the Po, and you were in the district of Picenum, I missed you less ; since I am in town, while you are still in Picenum, I miss you a great deal more ; whether it is that the very spots where we are accustomed to be together bring you more keenly to my remembrance ; or else that nothing sharpens one's longing after absent friends so much as vicinity to them, and so, the nearer you come to the hope of enjoying their society, the more impatient are you at being deprived of it. Whatever be the cause, deliver mp from this misery. Come to me, or else I shall return to the place whence I rashly hurried, if only for this purpose, in order to learn by experience whether you, when you first find yourself in Eome without me, will write me such a letter as this. (2.) To Arkianus. It happens to me not unfrequently, in our law courts, to miss M. Ptcgulus : I would not say, to regret him. Why, then, to miss him ? Because he held our profession in honour, and used to b3 solicitous, and wan with study, and to write out his speeches, though he never could learn them by heart. The very fact that he used to paint round, sometimes his right, sometimes his left eye, the right one if he was going to speak for a plaintiff, and the left if for a defendant; that he used to transfer a white plaster from one eyebrow to another; that he always consulted * the soothsayers on the result of his pleadings : all this originated, it is true, in excessive superstition, and yet at the same time in a great regard for the profession. This, to begin with, was particularly pleasant to those who were engaged in the same causes, that he always asked for unlimited time, and got together an audience by invitation ; for what can be more pleasant than to speak as long as you like, while the annoyance is laid to another's charge, and to speak at your ease, yet with an appearance of being surprised by an audience which others have got together. But, however all this may be, Kegulus did well to die, and he would have done better if he had died sooner. ]SI\"ow, certainly, he might have lived without injury to the public, under a Prince in whose reign he could have done no mischief. So it is allowable to miss him sometimes. For since his death a custom has extensively and increasingly prevailed of demanding, as well as allotting, two water-clocks per speaker^o r even ouej sometimes as little as half a one; since the bar want to have done with their speeches rather than to speak, and the bench to have finished their business rather than to judge. Such is the negligence, the apathy, and in short the irreverence, with which our profession and its perils are regarded. Pray, are we wiser than our ancestors ? Are we more just than the laws themselves, which freely accord so many hours, so many days, so many adjournments ? Were those ancestors of ours dullards and beyond measure slow, and do we speak more clearly, understand more rapidly, and decide more conscientiously, because we hurry through our causes with a smaller number of water-clocks than they used to take days to settle them in? Piegulus, you used to obtain from all the judges by your artifices that which extremely few of them accord to integrity ! I at all events, whenever I sit as judge (which is my place even more often than at the bar), allow as much water as any one asks for ; inasmuch as I deem it an act of temerity to predict the length of a cause still unheard, and to place a limit of time on a matter whose proportions are unknown, particularly since the first thing which a judge owes to the faithful discharge of his duty is patience, which indeed is a large ingredient in justice. But a good deal that is superfluous is spoken ! Be it so : yet it is better that even this should be spoken, than that what is essential should be unspoken. Besides you cannot possibly know whether it is superfluous or not, till you have heard what it is. However it will be better to talk of this, and of many other public abuses, when we meet. For you too, with your regard for the common interests, are in general desirous that matters which it would now be difficult to set straight may be at any rate amended. Now, let us cast a glance at our households. Pray, is all well in yours ? In mine, there is nothing new ; and for me, the blessings I enjoy are rendered more grateful by their continuance, while incommodities are lightened by habit. (3.) To Verus. I thank you for undertaking the cultivation of the farm given by me to my nurse. It was worth a hundred thousand sesterces* when I gave it her. Subsequently, the returns diminishing, its value fell with them ; but now under your management it will recover itself. Only please to bear in mind that I am entrusting to you not trees and soil merely -though I do entrust these as wellbut my small iwcscnt. And that this should be as pro- ductive as possible is not of greater interest to her who received than to me who bestowed it. BOOK VL i8r ( 401To CULPURNIA, HIS WiFE. I never complained more than now of my occupations, which did not suffer me either to accompany you when you started for Campania for your health's sake, or to follow close after your departure. Tor at this time par- ticularly I desired to be with you, in order to judge with my own eyes how far you are recruiting your strength and your dear little body, and, in short, whether you have passed through that delightful retreat and rich country without receiving any hurt. Indeed, if you were quite strong, my longing after you would not be unmingled with anxiety : for to be sometimes without news of an ardently beloved object is fraught with suspense and un- easiness. Now, however, the consideration of your delicate health, as well as your absence, torments me with vague disquietudes of various kinds, I apprehend everything, conjure up everything, and, as the nature of frightened people is, the things which of all others I deprecate are pre- cisely those which I picture to myself. Wherefore, I the more urgently beseech you to have regard for my fears by writing me one, or even two letters a day. For I shall be more comfortable while reading them, and shall straight- way fall to fear again, as soon as they are read. (5.) To Uesus. I wrote you word that Varenus had obtained leave to compel the attendance of witnesses on his behalf ; * which seemed to most to be fair, though some were obstinate in thinking it unjust, particularly Licinius Nepos, who, at the next meeting of the Senate, when other matters were before it, discussed the recent decree, thus reopening a * To subpoena them, as we say. See Book V., Letter 20. PLINY'S LETTERS. cause which had been disposed of. He went so far as to add that the Consuls should be asked to submit a motion (after the precedent of the Bribery Laws) on the subject of that against extortion. \" Was it their pleasure that, for the future, an addition should be made to that law to the effect that, as the law in question gave power to accusers to collect materials and to enforce the attendance of witnesses, so a similar power should be given to the accused ? \" There were some who were displeased by this speech of his, as coming too late, out of season, and in the wrong place ; inasmuch as the proper time for speaking against the decree had been neglected, and now fault was found with that which had been settled and which might have been opposed. Indeed Juventius Celsus, the Prffitor, reproved him at length and with vigour for setting himself up as a corrector of the Senate, ISTepos replied, and Celsus retorted ; and neither of them refrained from insults. I don't choose to record words which I was vexed to hear tlicm utter, so as to make me all the more in- dignant at some of our order, who were running backwards and forwards from Celsus to Nepos, according as one or the other was speaking, from curiosity to hear ; and who by way of egging them on and inflaming them at one time, of reconciling and making it up between them at another, invoked \" the approval of Csesar,\" generally on behalf of each singly, but at times in favour of both, as at some spectacle for the public amusement ! What to my mind was a most painful feature in all this, was that each had got information of what the other was preparing for him ; for Celsus replied to Nepos from a written paper, and Nepos to Celsus from his note-book. Such was the loquacity of their friends that these men, on the point of wrangling, had a mutual knowledge of the event, just as though it had been arranged between them. BOOK VL 183 (6.) To FUNDANUS. Now, if ever, I could wish you were iu Eome, and I beg that you will be. I have need of one to share my aspira- tions, my labours, my anxiety. Julius Naso is a candi- date for office ; he is standing with many competitors and good ones too, whom it will be glorious to beat and cor- respondingly difficult. So I am in a state of suspense, and am exercised by hope as well as troubled by fear, no longer feeling; like one who has himself served the office of Consul ; but once more imagining myself a candidate for each of the posts successively filled by me. He merits this anxiety by his long affection for me. My friendship for him is not, to be sure, derived from any I had for his fatherfor in consequence of my age that could not behowever, when I was barely a stripling, his father used to be held out to me as a man of great reputa- tion. He was deeply attached, not to learning only, but also to learned men, and was in the habit of coming almost daily to hear those whom I frequented at that time, Quintilian and Nicetes Sacerdos. He was in other respects a distinguished and authoritative personage, whose memory ought to be of service to his son. But now there are many in the Senate to whom he was unknown, and though there are many to whom he was known, yet these honour none but the living ; so that my friend, putting aside the glory of his fatherwhich, though a great illustration, is but a feeble recommendation to him must all the more vigorously exert himself and go to work in person. And this to be sure he has always care- fully done, as if foreseeing the present occasion. He has procured friends for himself, and those whom he has pro- cured he has cultivated ; we, certainly, as soon as he per- mitted himself to form a judgment, he selected as the object of his affection and imitation. He stands watchful 1 84 PLINY'S LETTERS. by me when speaking in public ; he sits by me when I recite ; he interests himself in my literary trifles from their very inception and from the moment of their birth ; alone now, formerly in company with his brother, whose part (for he is lately dead) I ought to undertake, whose place I ought to fill. I grieve indeed that the one should have been so cruelly torn from us by a premature death, and the other deprived of his brother's assistance and left to the help of his friends alone. For these reasons I implore you to come and join your suffrages to mine.* It is of great importance to me to be able to produce you and go about with you. The weight you carry is so great as to make me think I could canvass even my own friends more successfully in your company.

The canvass is mine, the danger is mine. In short, if Naso gets what he asks, his will be the honour ; if he fails, the defeat will be mine. To Calpurnia, his Wife. You write that you are not a little affected by my absence, and that you have but one solacein possess- ing my books instead of me, and even in often laying them beside you in bed, in my place. I am glad that you miss me, glad that you are soothed by such lenitives as these. In return, I keep reading your letters, and ever and anon take them into my hands as if they were just received, yet all the more am I inflamed with a longing for you. For when your letters are so agreeable, what must be the charm of your conversation ! However, do * Suffragio meo tuum jungas, join backers -'nominators,' as we should me as a sujj'ragator, \"as one of the say-of my friend.\" BOOK VI. 185 yoTi write as often as you can, though your doing so de- lights me in such a way as to torment me at the same time. (8.) To Peiscus. You both know and have a regard for Atilius Crescens. Indeed, what man of any mark either does not know him or has not a regard for him ? He is one whom I cherish, not after the vulgar fashion, but with my whole heart. Our native towns are separated by one day's journey only. Our love for each other beganand this is the most fervent kind of lovewhen we were mere striplings. It endured to after years, and far from being cooled, was strengthened by our mature judgment. Those who are most intimately acquainted with either of us know this. For, not only does he widely proclaim and circulate his friendship for me, but I too make no secret of the interest I feel in his modest life, his repose, and his security. Moreover, when he apprehended the insolence of a cer- tain individual who was about to enter on the Tribuneship of the Plebs, and had informed me of the fact, I replied, \" Not during my lifetime ! \" * Why do I tell you aU this ? That you may know that Atilius shall not suffer an injury while I am in existence. Again you will say, \" Why all this ? \" Why, because Valerius Varus owed him a sum of money. Now the heir of this Varus is our friend Maximus, whom I myself have a great regard for, but you a still closer one. I pray you then, and indeed demand of you by right of our friendship, to see that my good Atilius has not only the principal but also several years' interest secured to him.

For, the literary pursuits, in which he so greatly excels, he follows only for his own pleasure and glory. The smallest loss is a hard matter for him, it being so very hard to make good what is lost. Relieve him and relieve me from this difficulty : suffer me to enjoy to the full his amiable and sprightly character; for indeed I can't bear to see one sad whose cheerfulness will not allow me to be sad. In short, you know the quaint humour of the man, and I pray you take care that in- justice does not turn it to bile and bitterness. What will be the strength of his resentment you may judge by that of his affection. His lofty and independent spirit will not brook a loss accompanied by an affront. And though he should brook it, I shall esteem the loss and the affront my own ; only I shall be much more indignant than if it were my own. However, why employ denunciations and what may seem threats ? Eather, as I began, so I beg and pray you to see to it that he does not think himself neglected by me (which I most strongly fear), or I think the same of you. And you will see to it, if the latter consideration weighs as much with you as the former does with me. (9.) To Tacitus. You commend Julius Naso to my favour as a candidate. Naso to me I What if you commended my own self ! However, I bear with it and forgive you. For I should have commended this very Naso to you, if you had been staying in Rome and I had been absent.

To Albinus. On my arrival at my mother-in-law's house near Alsium, which was once the property of Eufus Verginius,* the sight of the place itself painfully renewed my regrets for that admirable and illustrious man. For this was the retreat where he commonly resided, calling it indeed \" the dear little nest of his old age.\" Turn where I would, my soul, my eyes, looked for him. I was desirous of seeing his monument as well, and repented having seen it. For it is still unfinished ; nor is this owing to any difficulty in the undertaking (which is of moderate, or rather small, dimensions), but to the apathy of the person on whom the duty was enjoined. A sense of indignation mingled with pity steals over me to think that ten years after his death there should be lying without an epitaph, without a name over them, the ashes of one the glory of whose memory pervades the world. Yet he bad enjoined and provided that that divine and immortal exploit of his should be inscribed in verse. \" Here Eufus lies, who Vindex overcame, Not for his own, but for his country's fame.\" So rare is fidelity in friendship, so easy is it to forget the dead, that we ought to raise for ourselves even our own sepulchres and to anticipate all the duties of our heirs. For who has not cause to fear what we see to have hap- pened in the case of Verginius ? Only in his case his celebrity makes the wrong done him, as it is the more undeserved, so also the more widely known. (II.) To Maximus.

Both of them exhibited remarkable mo- desty, yet with resolution unimpaired. Their deportment was noble, their language pure Latin, their voices manly, their memories tenacious, and their great natural faculties were equalled by their judgment. Each of these things singly was a pleasure, and, together with them this, that the young men directed their glances at me as their guide and teacher, and seemed to those who heard them to be imi- tating me and treading in my footsteps. day (for I must repeat it) most joyful, and to be marked by me with the whitest of stones ! What, indeed, can be more joyful, in a public point of view, than that young men of the highest rank should be seeking a name and fame from intellectual pursuits ; or more desirable for me personally than that I should be set up as a kind of model to such as have noble aims ? I pray the gods to make me the constant recipient of such delight as this ; and I beg of these same gods (taking you to witness) that all those who shall think it worth their while to imitate me may desire to be better than me. (12.) To Fabatus, his Wife's Grandfather. You, assuredly, ought not to hold your hand in recommending to me those persons whom you think worthy of support. For, not only is it becoming in you to render services to many, but it becomes me also to undertake whatever pertains to your wishes. Consequently I will do all in my power for Vettius Priscus, particularly in my own arenathat is, in the Centumviral Court. You bid me forget those letters which you wrote me, as you term it, with your heart laid open. But there are no letters which I more desire to bear in mind. For by these I am particularly made sensible of the strength of your affection for me, since you dealt with me as you were used to deal with your own son. Nor can I conceal from you that they were rendered all the more agreeable to me by the fact that I had a good case, since I liad attended with the greatest diligence to what you wished attended to. Accordingly I entreat you, again and again, always to convey your reproaches to me in the same straightforward way as often as I shall seem to fall short (I say \" seem,\" for I never shall really fall short), since / shall understand that they proceed from the strength of your affection, and you will rejoice to find that I do not deserve them. (I3-) To Ursus. Have you ever seen any one so troubled and exercised as my friend Varenus ? He has had to defend, and as it were make fresh application for, that which he had ob- tained only after a great struggle.* The Bithynians were impudent enough to criticise the decree of the Senate, and even to try and invalidate it, before the Consuls, and actually to incriminate it to the Emperor, who was absent from Eome. On being referred back to the Senate by him, they did not desist from their efforts. Claudius Capito spoke for them, disrespectfully rather than firmly, since he impeached a decree of the Senate in presence of the Senate, Catius Fronto replied with dignity and resolution. The Senate itself was admirable. For even those who had previously been for refusing the applica- tion of Varenus were of opinion that, having once been allowed, it should still be allowed, on the ground that though it was permissible for individuals to differ when a matter was undecided, yet when it was fairly settled the \"ision of the majority should be unanimously upheld. * See Letter 5 of this Book, and Book V. , Letter 20. igo PLINY'S LETTERS. Only Acilius Eufus and, with him, some seven or eightseven ratherpersisted in their former opinion. In this small number there were some whose temporary fit of severity, or rather affectation of severity, furnished much amusement. You will, however, be able to judge what a struggle awaits us in the fight itself, when the preludes to it and the preliminary skirmishes, so to speak, have aroused such contests. (I4-) To Maueicus. You invite me to your place near Formiae. I will ac- cept on one condition, that you do not put yourself out in any way ; an arrangement by which I bargain for myself as well. For it is not the sea and the seaside that J am going after, but my own ease, and liberty, and you ; other- wise it would be preferable to remain in town. It is best that one's actions should be entirely dependent on the will of others, or else on one's own : the nature of my taste is certainly such that it will have nothing but what is com- plete in itself and free from admixture.* (I5-) To EOMANUS. You were not present at a very curious occurrence, nor was I either ; but the story reached me soon after the event. Passennus Paulus, a distinguished Eoman knight, and among the first for learning, writes elegiac verse. This runs in his family ; he is a townsman of Propertius, and even numbers Propertius among his ancestors. As this Paulus was reciting, he commenced with these words -\"Priscus, thou bids't me.\" Upon which Javolenus Prisons (who was present in his * He means -I would rather re-I like. One thing or the other : con- main in Rome, entirely devoted to stant occupation or perfect freedom, business, than go into the country, I can't stand a mixture, unless I can do there entirely what character of a particular friend of Paulus) cried out, \" / don't bid you, however.\" You may imagine how the people laughed and jested. To be sure, Priscus is of doubtful sanity, yet he takes part in ceremonial occasions, sits as assessor to the magistrates, and even gives legal opinions publicly, v/hich makes this action of his all the more ridiculous and remarkable. Meanwhile Paulus, through another's folly, found his audience somewhat chilled. Such particular care should people take beforehand, when they are going to recite, not only to be sane themselves, but also to invite none but sane hearers. (16.) To Tacitus. You ask me to write you an account of my uncle's end, in order that you may be able the more faithfully to transmit it to posterity. I thank you, as I see that his death, if commemorated by you, has an imperishable re- nown offered it. For thouf^h he fell amid the destruction of such fair regions, and seems destined to live for everlike so many peoples and citiesthrough the memorable character of the disaster; though he himself was the author of many and enduring works ; yet the immortality of your writings will add greatly to the uninterrupted continuance of his fame. For my part I deem those blessed to whom, by favour of the gods, it has been granted either to do what is worth writing of, or to write what is worth reading ; above measure blessed those on whom both gifts have been con- ferred. In the latter number will be my uncle, by virtue of his own and of your compositions. Hence, I the more readily undertake, and even lay claim to peform what you request. He was at Misenum, in personal command of the fleet. The ninth day before the Kalends of September, at about the seventh hour, my mother indicated to him the appear- ance of a cloud of unusual size and shape. He had sunned himself, and next gone into his cold bath ; and after a light meal, which he took reposing, was engaged in study. He called for his sandals, and ascended to a spot from which this portent could best be seen. A cloud was risingfrom what mountain was a matter of uncertainty to those who looked at it from a distance : afterwards it was known to be Vesuviuswhose appearance and form would be re- presented by a pine better than any other tree. For, after towering upwards to a great height with an extremely lofty stem, so to speak, it spread out into a number of branches; because, as I imagine, having been lifted up \"by a recent breeze, and having lost the support of this as it grew feebler, or merely in consequence of yielding to its own weight, it was passing away laterally. It was at one time white, at another dingy and spotted, according as it carried earth or ashes. To a man of my uncle's attain- ments, it seemed a remarkable phenomenon, and one to be observed from a nearer point of view. He ordered his fast-sailing cutter to be got ready, and, in case I wished to accompany him, gave me leave to do so. I replied that I preferred to go on with my studies, and it so happened that he had himself given me something to write out. He was in the act of leavincj the house, when a note was handed him from Rectina.* Coesius Bassus, frightened, together with the people there,* at the imminence of the peril (for his villa lay under the mountain, and there was no escape for him except by taking ship), begged my uncle to rescue him from so critical a situation. Upon this he changed his plan, and, having started on his enterprise as a student, proceeded to carry it out in the spirit of a hero. He launched his four-ranked galleys, and embarked in person, in order to carry assistance, not to Rectina only, but to many others, for the charms of the coast caused it to be much peopled. He hastened in the direction whence * Apparently a place between Por-inniinenti periculo extcJTitae. If tliis tici and Herculaneum.

Ashes were already fall- ing on the ships, hotter and thicker the nearer they ap- proached ; and even pumice and other stones, black, and scorched, and cracked by the fire. There had been a sudden retreat of the sea, and the debris from the mountain made the shore unapproachable. Having hesitated for a moment whether to turn back, he shortly called out to the helmsman (who was urging him to do so), \" Fortune favours the brave ! Make in the direction of Pomponianus.\" The latter was at Stabise, separated from him by the whole width of the bay, for the sea flows in by shores gradually winding and curving inwards. There, in view of the danger which, though it had not yet approached, was nevertheless manifest, and must be upon them as soon as it extended itself, he had got his effects together on board ship, resolved to fly,* if only the wind left off blowing from the opposite quarter. My uncle, brought to shore by this same wind, which precisely favoured him, embraced his trembling friend, consoling and exhorting him, and, in order to calm his fears by his own sang froid, bade them conduct him to the bath. After bathing, he took his place at table, and dined gaily, or (which was equally heroic) with an air of gaiety. Meanwhile, from many points of Mount Vesuvius, vast sheets of flame and tall columns of fire were blazing, the flashes and brightness of which were heightened by the darkness of night. My uncle, to soothe the terrors of those about him, kept telling them that these were fires which the frightened country people had left to burn, and that the deserted houses were blazing away all by them- * Certus fugae.

Then he gave himself up to repose, and slept a perfectly genuine sleep, for his snoring (which in conse- quence of his full habit was heavy and loud) was heard by those in attendance about his door. However, the courtyard from which this suite of rooms was approached was already so full of ashes mixed with pumice-stones that its surface was rising, and a longer stay in the bedchamber would have cut off all egress. On being aroused, he came forth and rejoined Pom- ponianus and the others who had kept watching. They consulted tosjether whether to remain under cover or wander about in the open; for the walls nodded under the repeated and tremendous shocks, and seemed, as though dislodged from their foundations, to be swaying to and fro, first in one direction and then in another. On the other hand, in the open air, there was the fall of the pumice-stones (though they were light and burnt out) to be apprehended. However, a comparison of dangers led to the choice of the latter course. With my uncle indeed it was a case of one reason getting the better of another; while in the case of others fear overcame fear. They covered their heads with pillows tied round with cloths : this was their way of protecting themselves against the shower. By this time it was day else- where, but there it was night, the blackest and thickest of all nights, which, however, numerous torches and lights of various kinds served to alleviate. It was decided to make for the shore, in order to learn from the nearest point whether the sea was by this time at all available. A huge and angry sea still continued running. Here, reclining on a cloth which had been thrown on the ground, my imcle more than once called for a draught of cold water and swallowed it. Upon this, an outbreak of flame and smell of sulphur, premonitory of farther flames, put some to flight and roused him. With the help of two slave-boys he rose from the ground, x^uipii^cJcHiniediately fell back, owing (as I gather) to the BOOK VI. 195 dense vapour obstructing his breath and stopping up the access to his gullet, which with him was weak and narrow and frequently subject to wind. When day returned (the third from that which he had looked upon for the last time *) his body was found whole and uninjured, in the dress he wore ; its appearance was that of one asleep rather than dead. Meanwhile my mother and I at Misenumhowever, this has nothing to do with history, nor did you wish to learn anything except what related to his death. So I will make an end. This alone I will add, that everv- thing related by me has been either matter of personal observation or else what I heard on the spot, the time of all others when the truth is told. Do you select what you choose. For a letter is a different matter from a history ; it is one thing to write to a friend and another to write for the world. ^' (Anon, n.d.) To Eestitutus. I can't refrain from letting off by letter to yousince it is not my good luck to be able to do it in your presence the touch of indignation experienced by me at a recita- tion held by a certain friend of mine. A production of a most finished kind was being read ; and this, two or three of the company (learned persons, as they seemed to themselves and a few others) listened to, with the appear- ance of deaf and dumb people. They never parted their lips, they never moved a hand, they never rose from their seats, if it had been only from the fatigue of remaining seated. \"Whence all this solemnity and wisdom? Nay rather what duluess, arrogance, perversity, or more properly madness, to employ a whole day with the * His body was found next morn-ness, Pliny is able to express bimself, ing : but counting\" the day of his death as in the text, in the Eoman idiom. as no day at all, owing to the dark- special object of offending and leaving as an enemy the man to whose house you have come as to a special friend ! Are you a more learned man than he? So much the less room for envy, for he who is envious shows his inferiority. In short, whether you are worth more than him, or less than him, or the same as he is, praise him in his capacity of inferior, or superior, or equal; if your superior, because, unless he is worthy of praise, you yourself cannot be ; if your inferior or equal, because it con- cerns your own reputation that the man whom you excel, or even are on a par with, should appear as great as possible. For my part I actually revere and admire all those who accomplish anything in literature. For it is a difficult, arduous, and fastidious pursuit, one which in its turn spurns those who spurn it: unless by chance you entertain a different opinion. And yet what individual has a greater respect for the pursuit than you, or where can there be a kindlier critic ? And this is the consideration which has led me to inform you in particular of my indignation, as being the person most sure to share my feelings. (i8.) To Sabinus. You ask me to appear for the Firmani, in their State trial; and, though busied with numerous occupations, I will do my best for them. I desire indeed to lay under an obligation not only a most distinguished colony, by undertaking the office of their advocate, but also you yourself by a service which is so agreeable to you. For since, as you are in the habit of proclaiming, the friendship which exists between us is looked upon by you in the light of an advantage and a glory, there is nothing which I ought to deny you, particularly when you ask on behalf of your birth-place. What indeed can be more honourable than prayers prompted by duty, or more efficacious than * BOOK VL 197 those which spring from affection ? Accordingly, plight my troth to your, or rather now to our, friends, the Firmani. Not only does their own distinction give promise that they are worthy of my efforts and zeal, but also especially this consideration, that those are likely to be men of great worth among whom such a one as you has arisen. (19.) To ISTepos. Are you aware that the price of land has risen, and particularly of land near Eome ? The cause of this sudden dearness is a matter which has been the subject of much discussion. At the last Comitia the Senate gave expression to an opinion which did it great honour : \" that candidates should not give banquets, nor send presents, nor lodge money for the purpose of bribery,\" of which practices the two former were carried on as openly as they were unstintedly, and the third, though done privately, was perfectly ascertained. Upon which my friend Homullus carefully availing himself of this consensus of the Senate when called on to vote, proposed a resolution that the Consuls should make known the universal wish to the Emperor, and should beg him, as he had done in the case of other abuses, to employ his sagacity in counteracting this one. He is counteracting it : by a bribery law he has restrained the former shameful and discreditable ex- penditure on the part of candidates : and he has ordered them to invest a third part of their fortunes in real estate, deeming it disgraceful, as indeed it was, that those who sought honours should look upon Eome and Italy, not as their country, but as a kind of inn or hostelry, like so many people on their travels. There is consequently a rush of candidates ; they are bidding against each other for the purchase of whatever they hear is for sale, and in this way are the means of bringing fresh properties into the market. Accordingly, if you are tired of your farms iu Italy, this is the time for selling, as also, by Hercules, for buying in the provinces,* since these same candidates are selling there in order to buy here. (20.) To Tacitus. You say that the letter I wrote you, at your request, on the subject of my uncle's death has made you wish to know what I myself, when left behind at Misenumfor with the mention of this I broke offhad to go through, not merely in the way of alarms, but of actual adventures. \" Thougli memory shuns the theme, I will begin.\" f After the departure of my uncle, I devoted what time was left to study (it was for that purpose that I remained behind) ; the bath shortly followed, then dinner, then a short and troubled sleep. There had been heavings of the earth for many days before this, but they produced the less apprehension from being customary in Campania. On that night, however, they so much increased that every- thing seemed not so much to be in motion as to be turned upside down. My mother rushed into my room; I was similarly getting up with the intention of arousing her in case she were asleep. We sat down in a courtyard attached to the house, which separated by a small space the dwelling from the sea, I do not know whether to style it intrepidity or imprudence on my part, seeing that I was only in my eighteenth year ; however, I called for a volume of Livy, and read it as though quite at my ease, and even made extracts from it, as I had begun to do. Upon this, a friend of my uncle's, who had lately come to him from Spain, when he saw my mother and me seated, and me reading into the bargain, reproved her for her apathy and me for my insensibility to danger. None the less * In provinciis, in the Roman sense + The original is a quotation from as distinguished from Italy. J<)ueid ii. 12. accipii. BOOK VI. 197 diligently did I devote myself to my book. It was now seven o'clock in the morning, yet still there was but a kind of sickly and doubtful light ; now, too, that the sur- rounding buildings had been shaken, as the place in which we were, though not under cover, was of small dimensions, there was a great and unavoidable risk of our being over- whelmed. Then, at last, Ave decided on leaving the town. The mass of the inhabitants followed us terror-stricken, and (an effect of panic causing it to resemble prudence) preferring the guidance of others to their own, they pressed on us as we were making off, and impelled us forwards with their crowded ranks. When we had got beyond the buildings we stopped. There we experienced much that was strange, and many terrors. For the vehicles which we had ordered to be brought out, though standing on a per- fectly level plain, were rocking from one side to the other, and would not remain still in the same place even when propped under with stones. Moreover, we saw the sea sucked back into itself, and repulsed as it were by the quaking of the earth. The shore had certainly encroached on the sea, and retained a number of marine animals on its dry sands. On the other side of us a black and terrible cloud, broken, by the zig-zag and tremulous careerings of the fiery element, A^as parting asunder in long trains of flame : these were like lightning, but on a larger scale. Then, indeed, the above-mentioned friend from Spain became more urgent and pressing. \" If,\" said he, \" your brother and your uncle is alive, it is his wish that you should be in safety ; if he has perished, it xcas his wish that you should survive him. Why then hesitate to escape ? \" We replied that we could not so act as, while uncertain of his safety, to provide for our own. Without further delay he rushed off, and got out of reach of danger as fast as he could. Not long after, the cloud in question descended on the earth and covered the sea. Already it had enveloped and hidden from view Caprese, and blotted out the promontory of Misenum. Upon this my mother begged and prayed and even ordered me to make my escape as best I could, it being in my power as a young man to do so ; as for lierself, retarded by her years and her frame, she was well content to die provided she had not been the cause of my death. I, on the other hand, declared that I would not be saved except in her company, and clasping her hand I compelled her to quicken her pace. She obeyed with reluctance, blaming herself for delaying me. And now came a shower of ashes, though as yet but a thin one. I looked back : a dense mist was closing in behind us, and following us like a torrent as it streamed along the ground. \" Let us turn aside,\" said I, \" while we can still see, lest we be thrown down in the road and trampled upon in the darkness by the crowd which accompanies us.\" \"We had scarcely sat down when night came on, not such as it is when there is no moon, or when there are clouds, but the night of a closed place with the lights put out. One could hear the shrieks of the women, the cries for help of the children, the shouts of the men : some were calling for their parents, others for their young ones, others for their partners and recognising them by their voices. Some were lamenting their own case, others that of those dear to them. There were those who, through fear of death, invoked death. Many raised their hands to the gods, but the greater number concluded that there were no longer gods anywhere, and that the last eternal night of story had settled on the world. Nor were there wanting those who by imaginary and false alarms increased the real dangers. Some present announced that such and such a part of Misenum had been overthrown, or such another was in flames ; falsely, yet to believing ears. There was a little light again, but this seemed to us not so much day-light as a sign of approaching fire. Accord- ingly there was fire, but it stayed at a considerable distance from us, then darkness again and a thick and heavy .shower of ashes. We got up from time to time and shook BOOK VI. 201 these off us ; otherwise we should have been covered with them and even crushed by their weight. I might make a boast of not having suffered to escape me either a groan or a word lacking in fortitude, in the midst of such perils, were it not for the fact that I believed myself to be perishing in company with all things, and all things with me, a miserable and yet a mighty consolation in death. At last, this black mist grew thin, and went off into a kind of smoke or haze ; soon came real day, and the sun even shone forth, luridly however, and with the appear- ance it usually wears under an eclipse. Our yet trembling eyes saw everything changed and covered with deep ashes as with snow. We returned to Misenum, and refreshed our persons as best we might, and there spent a night of suspense alternating between hope and fear. Fear pre- vailed, for the quaking of the earth continued, and many persons, crazy with terror, were sporting with their own and other's misfortunes by means of the most appalling predictions. Yet not even then, after experiencing and still expecting perils, did we think of going away till news came of my uncle. All this, which is in no way worthy of history, will be for you to read, not to write about, and you must lay it to your own account (since it was you who called for the communication) if it should seem to you not even worthy of a letter. (21.) To Caninius. / I am one of those who admire the ancients, yet I do not, like some, disparage the intellects of our own time. For it is not true that nature, as though wearied and effete, no lunger produces anything worthy of admiration. And indeed I lately heard Vergilius Paifus reading to a small company a comedy written after the model of the old comedy, and so well written that it may itself serve as a model some day. I do not know whether you are acquainted with the author, though you ought to be ; for he is a man of mark owing to his high character, his refined genius, and his versatility as a writer. He has written \" Mimiambi \" * with much delicacy, melody and grace, indeed masterpieces of their kind (for there is no kind of composition which, if carried to perfection, may not be styled a masterpiece) ; he has written comedies in imitation of Menander and other authors of the same age. You might rank them among the works of Plautus and Terence. Now, for the first time, though not with the air of a beginner, he exhibits himself in the old comedy. Vigour, grandeur, subtlety, pungency, sweetness, humour, none of these are wanting to him: he exalts virtue and lashes vice, employing fictitious names with good taste, and real ones with appropriateness. In my case only he has transgressed the bounds, through excess of complais- ance, except for this indeed that poets are licensed to fib. To sum up, I shall squeeze the book out of him and send it to you to read, or rather to be learnt by heart, for I am sure you will not lay it down, if you once take it up. (22.) To Tiro. An affair has taken place, which is of importance to all those who are destined to govern provinces, and of importance too to those who trust implicitly in their friends. Lustricius Bruttianus, having discovered Montanius Atti- cinus, one of his suite, in many delinquencies, reported liim to Csesar. Atticinus added to his former delinquencies by accusing the man whom he had deceived. An in- vestigation was allowed, and I was among the assessors. Each party pleaded his own case ; in a summary way, * Mimic poems, in iambics. BOOK VI. 203 however, and toucliing only on the heads, a method by which the truth is at once brought to light. Bruttianus produced his will, which he declared to have been written by the hand of Atticinus ; this showed the closeness of their intercourse and the necessity which had driven him to complain of one whom he had loved so dearly. He enumerated certain disgraceful and palpable offences ; which charges Atticinus, being unable to impair, retorted in such a way as to prove himself a mean knave by his defence and a scoundrel by his accusations. For by bribing one of the secretaries' slaves, he had intercepted the Governor's official minutes and mutUated them, and now with consummate rascality was trying to turn his own crime to account against his friend. Csesar acted nobly. He called for our verdicts, not on Bruttianus but forthwith on Atticinus. The latter was convicted and banished to an island. Bruttianus received a perfectly merited acknowledgment of his integrity, and, in addition to this, obtained the credit due to his energy; for, after making short work of his own defence, he conducted his accusation with vigour, and showed that he was as spirited as he was good and honest. This I have written to you by way of warning you beforehand, now that you have had a province allotted to you, to trust to yourself for the most part, and not put entire confidence in any one else. Next, you will learn, that should any one chance to deceive you (which may the gods avert !) satisfaction is provided you. Yet, again and again be careful that there may be no need of this ; for it is not so agreeable to be vindicated as it is miserable to be imposed upon. (23.) To Teiaeius. You beg me urgently to undertake a case in which you are interested, and which, independently of this, is an important one, exciting public attention. I will do so, but not gratuitously. \" Can it be,\" say you, \" that you won't act gratuitously ? \" Yes, it can be ; for I sliall exact a fee more creditable to me than if I held a brief for you gratis. I ask, and indeed stipulate, that Cremutius Euso shall be with me in the case. This is a practice of mine, and one which I have frequently followed before now in the case of several young men of distinction. For I am excessively anxious to exhibit young men of promise to the Courts, and to introduce them to fame. This service I ought to render to Euso, if to any one, whether on account of the nobility of his own birth, or else of the extraordinary regard he has for me; and I think it of great consequence that he should be seen and heard in the same cases, and moreover on the same side, as myself. Oblige me then, oblige me, before he speaks ; for when he has once spoken, you will express your obligations. I guarantee that he will satisfy your anxieties and my hopes and the importance of the case. He has excellent qualities and will soon be bringing out other people, if meanwhile he be brought out by us. For indeed no man is gifted with a genius so immediately conspicuous as to be able to rise from obscurity, unless the materials, the opportunityay, and a patron too and one to recommend himfall to his lot. (24.) To Macee. What a mighty difference it makes, hy whom a thing is done ! For deeds of the same character are either exalted to the highest pitch or sunk in the depths of oblivion according to the fame or the obscurity of the actors. I was sailing on our lake Larius,* when an elderly friend pointed out to me a villa and moreover a saloon projecting over the lake. \" From that spot,\" said he, \" a townswoman * Now the Lago di Como. BOOK VI. of ours, once upon a time, precipitated herself in company with her husband.\" I inquired the reason. The husband had for a long time been an invalid, suffering from putrid ulcers in the groin* His wife insisted on seeing them ; no one (she said) could inform him more faithfully than she whether he was capable of being cured. She saw them and despaired. Next she advised him to die, and became herself his companion in death, nay rather his example and leader, the compelling cause of his death ; for she tied her husband to her, and jumped into the lake. This exploit was never heard of till recently, even by me her townsman ; not because it was smaller than Arria's celebrated exploit,t but because the agent was a smaller person. (25.) To HiSPANUS. You write word that Eobustus, a distinguished Eoman knight, got as far as Ocriculumto which point their road lay in commonwith Atilius Scaurus, a friend of mine, and that nothing further was heard of him. You wish for Scaurus to come and, if it be in his power, to put us on some track for inquiry. He shall come ; I fear to no purpose. Indeed I suspect that something or other has befallen Eobustus, similar to what once befell Metilius Crispus, a townsman of mine. I had obtained for him his Company, and had further presented him at his departure with forty thousand sesterces | for his outfit and equip- ment ; I never, after this, got any letters from him or any news with regard to his end. Whether he was cut off by his slaves, or in company with his slaves, is a matter of doubt ; certainly neither he nor any of his slaves subse- quently appeared, as indeed none of Eobustus's have. We we must accord tins to your prayers and to those, so highly to be commended, of that excellent youth who is making inquiry for his father with such marvellous affection and marvellous sagacity as well. May the gods be favourable, so that he may discover the object of his search, in the same way as he already discovered the person in whose company he had been. (26.) To Servianus. I am delighted, and congratulate you, that you have betrothed your daughter to Fuscus Salinator. His family is patrician, his father a man of the highest character, and his mother of like repute. He himself is of a studious and literary turn, indeed learned, a boy in candour, a young man in geniality, an elder in seriousness. Nor does my love for him deceive me. I do love him, to be sure, with effusion (his attentions and his respect for me have de- served this), yet I exercise my judgment, and indeed the more stringently the more I love him ; and I guarantee to you, as one who have closely investigated liim, that you will have a son-in-law than whom your wishes could not have formed a better. All that remains is that he should, as soon as possible, make you the grandfather of young ones like himself. How happy the time, when it will be my good fortune to receive from your arms his children and your grandchildrenjust as if they were my own Emperor* It is easy to find what to say, but by no means easy to make a selection ; so abundant is the material furnished by his virtues. However, I will write orwhich I should preferwill intimate to you my ideas by word of mouth, on condition of first exhibiting to you the causes of my hesitation. I am in doubt whether to advise you to do the same as I did. When Consul Elect, I abstained from all those usual topics which, though not flattery, would have borne the appearance of flattery ; not by way of showing my independence and fearlessness, but as understanding our Sovereign, whose greatest commendation I saw to be this, that nothing should be proposed by me in his honour, as though on compulsion. I remembered too that the most numerous honours had been conferred on the worst princes ; from whom our present excellent Sovereign could not be distinguished in any better way than by a different mode of speaking of him. This par- ticular point I did not disguise or pass in silence ; lest my treatment should haply seem due to forgetfulness instead of being the result of judgment. Such was my conduct on that occasion ; but the same course does not find favour with, is not indeed suitable to, all persons. Moreover, the grounds for doing or not doing anything are altered according to the circumstances of the parties themselves, and the matters in hand, and the occasion. For the recent achievements of our illustrious Prince furnish an opportunity of saying in the Senate much that is new and important as well as true. For which reasons, as I before said, I doubt whether to advise you to act now as I did then. This, however, I have no doubt about, that it was my duty to offer for your consideration the course pursued by myself. * Quid in honorem principis censeas. pected to make some complimentary The Cousul Elect when called on for remarks on the Sovereign, the first time for his vote was ex-2o8 PLINY'S LETTERS. (28.) To Pontius. I know the cause which prevented your arriving in Campania before me. But, albeit absent, you seem to have migrated here with all your possessions, such a plenty of town and country produce has been offered me in your name, all of which, though with great coolness, I have nevertheless accepted. For not only did your servants beg me to do so, but I feared you would be angry with me and with them if I had not done so. Tor the future, if you don't put a limit to this, I shall. And already I have announced to your servants that, on their bringing so many things another time, they would have to take them all back again. You will say it behoves me to use what is yours as though it were my own. Certainly ; but I am for being just as careful of it as though it were my own. (29-) To QUADKATUS. Avidius Quietus, who regarded me with particular affection and (I am no less glad to say) approval, used to relate many things of Thrasea, whose friend he had been, and among them frequently this. He was in the habit of laying it down that the causes to be undertaken were these : those of friends, those which could find no advocate, and those which pertained to example. The case of friends needs no explanation. Why such ^as could find no advocate ? Because in these the fearlessness as well as the kindliness of him who pleads them would be most strongly shown. Why those pertaining to example ? Because it would make a great difference whether a good or a bad one were exhibited. To these categories of causes, though perhaps rather presumptuously, I must yet add such as are distinguished and conspicuous. For it is fair BOOK VI. 209 at times to plead the cause of glory and famein other words, one's own cause. These are the limits which, since you have consulted me, I would impose on your sense of dignity and self- respect. JSTor do I forget that practice is both held to be and is the best teacher of the art of speaking; indeed, I see many who, with small parts and no literature, have by dint of pleading attained to pleading well. Yet I also find that saying to be most true which has come to me as Pollio's, or under the name of PoUio : \" Pleading well has been the cause of my pleading often, and pleading often the cause of my pleading less well ; \" because, in fact, by too constant practice facility rather than a real faculty is acquired, and rashness rather than self-reliance. Nor, indeed, was Isocrates prevented from being held a consummate orator by the fact that the weakness of his voice and his shyness impeded him from speaking in public. Accordingly read, write, and meditate a great deal, that you may be able to speak when you choose : you will speak when you ought so to choose. This is the mean which I myself have commonly preserved. Not unfre- quently I have yielded to necessity, which ranks as a reason. Por I have pleaded certain causes by order of the Senate, in the number of which, however, were some which come under the above classification of Thrasea, that is to say, were such as to pertain to example. I appeared for the Bgetici against Bsebius Massa. The question was whether an investigation should be granted. It was granted. I appeared again on behalf of the same parties when they made plaint against Csecilius Classicus. The question was as to the propriety of punishing provincials as the associates and subordinate agents of a governor. They suffered punishment. I prosecuted Marius Prisons, who was condemned in virtue of the law on extortion, and who profited by the clemency of that law, for by the enormity of his crimes he had outstripped its heaviest penalties. He was banished. I defended Julius Bassus, who, thougli too unguarded and incautious, was by no means criminal. Judges were assigned him, and he kept his place in the Senate. I spoke lately on behalf of Varenus, who demanded the right, equally with the other side, to com- pel the attendance of witnesses. He obtained it. For the future I pray that I may be ordered to plead those causes in particular which it would become me to undertake even of my own free will. (30.) To Fabatus, his Wife's Grandfather, \"We are bound, by Hercules, to celebrate your birthdays in the same manner as our own, since the joy of ours de- pends on yours, and through your diligence and care we are happy here, and at our ease when with you.* The Camil- lianf villa, which you possess in Campania, has certainly suiTered from age : everything of value about it, however, either remains intact, or is very slightly injured. I will see then to restorations beim:' made on the most reasonable terms. I seem to have many friends, but of that particular class whom you are in search of and the business demands, scarcely one ; for they are all men of the town, engaged in town pursuits : whereas for the manage- ment of country properties a rough-and-ready rustic sort of person is required, to whom this particular employment will not seem burdensome, nor the occupation one of petty interests, nor the solitude melancholy. You have a very favourable opinion of Rufus, as having been your son's friend. What, however, he may be able to do for us there, I am not in a position to say. That he has the best intentions, I believe. Summoned by our emperor to act as his assessor at Centum Cellee* (that was the name of the place), I ex- perienced the greatest pleasure. What indeed can be more delightful than to enjoy a near view of the prince's equity, wisdom, and affability, and that too in his retire- ment, where these qualities best disclose themselves? The subjects of investigation were of various kinds, and such as to test the merits of the judge by the diversity of their character. Claudius Ariston pleaded his cause, a leading citizen of Ephesus, a munificent man, seeking popularity by innocent means ; hence arose envy, and an informer was suborned against him by persons whose character was the opposite of his own. Accordingly he was acquitted, and received satisfaction. Next day the case of Gallita was heard, who was charged with adultery. This lady, the wife of a military tribune and candidate for office, had stained her own and her husband's reputation by an amour with a centurion. The husband had written to the consular legate, and he to Csesar. Csesar, after sifting the evidence, cashiered the centurion, and banished him into the bargain. There still remained a balance of punishment due to an offence which can only be committed by two persons. But the husband was kept back (not without incurring some censure for his forbearance) by his love for his wife, whom he had indeed kept in his house, even after information had been laid of the adultery, as though satisfied with having removed his rival. Admonished that he must go through with his charge, he did so very unwillingly. However, her con- demnation was unavoidable, unwilling as the prosecutor might be. She was convicted, and left to the penalties of Now Civita Vecchia. the Lex Julia. Csesar added to his judgment both the name of the centurion and a reference to military practice, that he might not seem to reserve for his own cognisance all cases of this kind. On the third day an investigation was entered upon, which had been the subject of a great deal of talk and a variety of reports. It related to some codicils of Julius Tiro, part of which were admitted to be genuine, while part were said to be forged. The persons indicted were Sempronius Senecio, a Eoman knight, and Eurythmus, Caesar's freedman and procurator. The heirs, while Csesar was in Dacia, had requested him in a joint letter to under- take the investigation. He had consented, and on his return had appointed a day ; and when some of the heirs, as if out of regard for Eurythmus, were for abandoning the prosecution, he had said most nobly, \" Neither is he Polyclitus, nor am I Nero.\" * However, he indulged them, at their request, with a delay, the period of which having expired, he now took his seat to hear the case. On the part of the heirs, two in all put in an appearance : they prayed either that the whole of the heirs should be compelled to act, since all had united in lodging the information, or that it might be permitted to them, as well as to the others, to withdraw from the suit. Csesar expressed himself with great wisdom and at the same time with great moderation; and when the advocate of Senecio and Eu- rythmus said that the accused would be left exposed to suspicion unless they were heard, \" I care not,\" said he, ' whether they are left exposed to suspicions : but / am.\" Then, turning to us, \" You understand how we ought to act ; these people want to make it a ground of complaint that they have been allowed to withdraw from the prose- cution.\"! Then, pursuant to the decision of the Council, * Polyclitus was a freedman of +\" If we allow them to retire from Nero. The sense is, \" I do not favour the case they will declare that this my freedmen, and wink at their op-was done to shield Eurythmus.\" I pressions and extortions, as Nero read isti enim queri volunt, quod sibi did.\" licuerit non accusare. BOOK VI. he ordered it to te announced to all the heirs that they must either proceed, or else individually make good their reasons for not proceeding, otherwise he should go the length of pronouncing a judgment of false accusation. You see how well, how seriously, employed were our days ; and these were followed by the most agreeable relaxations. We were invited each day to dinner, a modest one con- sidering that it was given by a prince. Sometimes we listened to the performances of artists, at others the even- ing was spent in the most delightful converse. On the last day, as we were taking our departure (so attentive is Csesar in his kindness), presents were sent us. To me, however, not only the important character of our inquiries, the distinction attaching to the Council, and the charm and simplicity with which we were entertained, but also the locality itself, was particularly delightful. The loveliest of villas is surrounded by the most verdant fields : it borders on the shore, in the bight of which a harbour is at this moment being made. The left-hand mole of this is protected by the strongest works ; that on the right hand is under construction. In the mouth of the harbour an island* is rising, to confront and break the force of the sea carried in by the winds, and to afford an entrance to ships on either side. Its rise, moreover, is worth seeing, from the ingenuity displayed. Huge stones are brought in by ships of the largest burden ; these being thrown into the sea,t one upon another, remain fixed by their own weight, and are gradually constructed into a kind of rampart. Its stony ridge already appears above the surface, scattering and throwing to a great height the waves which break on it. There is a mighty din there, and the sur- rounding sea is white with foam. Moles of cement^w ill be added to the stones, which, as time goes on, will pro- * What vre call % breakwater.

This harbour will bear, indeed already bears, the name of its author, and will be in the highest degree serviceable ; for the coast for a very long distance is without any harbour, and will now have the advantage of this place of refuge. (32.) To QUINTILIAN. Though you are personally the most modest of men in your desires, and though you have brought up your daughter as it was proper that your daughter and the grandchild of Tutilius should be brought up, nevertheless, as she is about to be married to a most honourable gentle- man. Nonius Celer, who by reason of his public employ- ments has a certain necessity imposed on him of making an appearance, she should be provided with a wardrobe and an establishment suitable to her husband's station ; matters which, though they will not add to her position, will be adornments and proper accompaniments to it. Furthermore, I know that while you are rich in mental endowments, your fortune is but small. According I lay claim to a share of your burden, and in the character of a second father to our dear girl, contribute towards her por- tion fifty thousand sesterces.* I would contribute a larger sum, were it not that it is by the smallness of my present alone that I have the assurance of being able to prevail on your modesty not to refuse it. * About £j,^o. BOOK Vr. To EOMANUS. ' * ' Throw, throw your tasks aside,' great Vulcan cried ; ' Off with your works begun.' \" * Whether you be reading or writing anything, \" throw it aside,\" \" off with it,\" be the order, and take in hand my speech, divine as were those arms of Vulcanwould it be possible to speak more boastfully ?well, in sober truth, an excellent one for a production of mine, and it is enough for me to compete with myself. This speech is on behalf of Attia Viriola, and is rendered remarkable by the station of the individual, the singularity of the case, and the im- portance of the decision. For, this lady, of lofty birth, married to a man of Praetorian rank, and disinherited by her octogenarian father within eleven days of the time when, smitten with love, he had brought home a step- mother for her, sought to recover her \"paternal property by a process instituted before the four courts. One hundred and eighty judges sat (for so many are brought together in the four chambers) ; there was a vast crowd of assistants on either side, and the benches were thronged ; moreover a dense circle of spectators, consisting of many rows, encircled the spacious court. Add to this that the tribune was packed, and even in the galleries of the build- ins women as well as men were hangingr over in their eagerness to hear, which was difficult, and to see, which was easy. Great was the expectation of fathers and daughters and even of stepmothers. The results which followed were various : for in two chambers we gained * The words in which Vulcan, in order to devote their attention to the the jEneid, bids the Cyclopes throw manufacture of arms for ^neas. aside what they were engaged on, in 2i6 PLINY'S LETTERS. the verdict, in the same number we lost it.* Truly a notable and marvellous thing that in the same cause, before the same judges, with the same advocates and on the same occasion, so great a diversity should occur by chance, yet so as not to look like chance. The step- mother was beaten, who had herself been made heir to a sixth part of the fortune, and Suberinus f was beaten, who, after being disinherited by his own father, had with singular impudence claimed the property of another person's father, though he did not dare to sue for that of his own parent. I have given you these details, first that you might learn from my letter what you could not have learnt from the speech, and secondly (for I will discover my arts) that you might have the greater pleasure in reading the speech, if you seemed to yourself not so much to be reading, as to be present at the trial. And though it be lengthy, I do not despair of its obtaining the same favour as a very short one. For its freshness is preserved by the abundance of the subject-matter, the niceness of the distinctions, by many short narratives and by the variety of the diction. There are many passages in it (I should not dare say this save to you) of an elevated kind, many of an argumentative, and many too of a subtle character. For in the midst of the former powerful and lofty passages, the necessity often interposed itself of dealing with matters of account, and almost of calling for table and counters, so that a Centumviral trial became all of a sudden changed into the form * Everything connected with the got judgment in his favour on two court of the Centumviri is so obscure points and lost it on two others. But that we have no certainty as to the this is against the text, which dis- meaning of this.

I gave full sails to my indignation, to my wrath, to my grief, and in so mighty a cause, as though on a great sea, was carried by many winds. In short, some of our friends generally consider this speech as being the \"Pro Ctesiphonte \" of my speeches ; * whether truly, you will most easily judge, who have them all so well in your memory as to be able to compare them with this, while reading this alone. (34.) To Maximus. You have acted rightly in promising a gladiatorial show to our friends at Verona, who have long loved and re- spected and honoured you. And it was thence you obtained that wife who was so dear to you and so de- servedly appreciated ; to whose memory either a construc- tion of some kind was due, or else a spectacle, and such a one as this in preference to any other, as being most suited to a death-celebration. Besides, you were entreated with so much unanimity that to refuse would have seemed not so much resolution as obstinacy. In this also you have acted admirably, in being so ready and liberal in furnishing the show ; for these are points too in which laro-e-mindness is shown. I could have wished that the panthers, of which you bought such numbers, had come to hand on the day appointed, but though tluy failed, from being detained by stress of weather, you at any rate deserved to get the credit of what it was no fault of yours that you did not exhibit. * Being to the rest of my orations of Ctesiphon is to hismy chcj what Demosthenes' speech on behalf d'osuvre, in fact. ( 2l8 ) BOOK VI I. To Geminus. The obstinacy of tliis illness of yours alarms me, and, though knowing how great is your self-control, I fear it may even affect your temper. Accordingly, I urge you to bear up against it with patience. This is the laudable, the wholesome course, and what I advise is within the power of human nature. For my part, at any rate, when in health, I am in the habit of dealing with my people after this fashion : \" It is assuredly my hope that, in case of falling sick, I shall desire nothing to be ashamed of or repented of ; yet, should the disease get the better of me, I warn you to give me nothing, except by permission of the doctors; and know that if you do give me anything, I shall punish the act in the same way as others punish a refusal to comply with their wishes.\" Moreover, on the occasion of my being burnt up by a raging fever, when, freed at last from the crisis and anointed, I received a drink from the doctor, I held out my pulse and bid him feel it, and thereupon gave back the cup which I had already raised to my lips. Afterwards, on the twentieth day of my illness, when I was being prepared for the bath, and noticed that the doctors were all of a sudden speaking together in an undertone, I inquired the reason. They replied that I might possibly bathe with safety, yet not altogether without some apprehension. \"Where,\" said I, \"is the necessity?\" and so placidly and calmly laying aside all hope of the bath, which I had seemed on the point of being conveyed to, I composed my mind and my looks for the privation no less readily than just before for the bath. BOOK VII. 219 All this I have written to you, firstly, that my warning might not be unaccompanied by an example, and next, that for the future I myself might be bound to the same course of self-control, through having engaged myself to it by this letter as by a kind of pledge. (2.) To Justus. How can it be consistent that in one and the same breath you declare you are engrossed by incessant occupa- tions and yet are longing for my productions, which even from idle folks can scarce obtain a moment of their useless time ? I will therefore permit your summer to go by, with its cares and its agitations, and not till winter (when it is presumable that in the evenings at any rate you will possibly have some leisure) will I consider which of my trifles had b^st be sent you. Meanwhile, it is enough if my letters do not prove a nuisance to youbut they must be, so they shall be cut shorter. Adieu. (3-) To Pr^sens. Still the same persistency on your part in remaining at one time in Lucania, at another in Campania ! \" Why,\" say you, \"I myself am a Lucanian and my wife is a Campanian.\" Good grounds these for a more protracted absence from town ; but not, however, for an uninterrupted one. Why not return then at some time to Eome, where consideration and honour and friendships, distinguished as well as humble, await you. How long will you continue to play the king, waking when you choose and sleeping as long as you choose ? How long are your dress-shoes to be nowhere, your toga to have a holiday, your whole day to be free ? It is time that you should revisit our worries, if with this object only, that those pleasures of yours may not languish through satiety. Pay your court to others for a brief while, that it may be the more agreeable to you to be courted in turn. Jostle in this crowd of ours, in order to enjoy solitude. But why foolishly retard him whom I am striving to recall ? For, perhaps, you will be urged by this very language of mine more and more to wrap your- self up in your ease, which I don't want to see broken up, but merely intermitted. For, just as if I were giving you a dinner I should intermingle with sweet dishes some that were sharp-flavoured and piquant, that your taste, deadened and cloyed by the former, might receive a fresh stimulus from the latter, so now I exhort you to season your most delectable mode of life now and then with, so to speak, a triflincT admixture of acids. o (4.) To Pontius. You say you have read my hendecasyllables ; you would even seek to know how it was that I began to write them, who am, in your estimation, a serious personage, and, as I myself admit, no trifler. I was at no time (to go back a long way) averse from the poetic art ; nay more, when fourteen years of age, I wrote a Greek tragedy. \" What sort of one ? \" you ask. I can't say ; it was called a tragedy. Afterwards, when, on my return from military service, I was detained by adverse winds in the island of Icaria, I wrote some Latin elegiacs on the sea there and the island itself. At times I have tried my hand at heroic metre ; now for the first time at hendecasyllables, which were originated and first saw the light in this wise. The chapters of Asinius Gallus on the comparison between his father and Cicero were being read to me at my house at Laurentum, when an epigram of Cicero on his favourite Tiro occurred. Afterwards, on retiring for a midday siesta (for it was summer time) when sleep failed to steal over BOOK VII. 221 me, I began to ponder how the greatest orators not only- esteemed this kind of literary effort as a recreation, but also took credit for it. I applied my mind, and, contrary to my expectation, after such long disuse, in a remarkably short space of time scribbled the following verses on the very subject which had induced me to write : -\"When Gallus I read, who pretends that his sire Had far more than Tully poetical fire : The wisest of men, I perceived, held it fit To temper his wisdom with love and with wit ; For Tully, grave Tully, in amorous strains Of the frauds of his paramour Tiro complains ; That, faithless to love and to pleasure untrue, From his promised embrace the arch wanton withdrew ; Then I said to my heart, * Why should' st thou conceal The sweetest of passions, the love which you feel ? Yes, fly, wanton Muse, and proclaim it around. Thy Pliny has loved and his Tiro has found.' The coy one so artful, who sweetly denies. And from the sweet flame, but to heighten it, flies.\" * I passed on to elegiacs ; these, too, I delivered myself of with no less celerity, and, corrupted by this facility, I added some iambics. Then, on my return to town, I read them to my friends. They approved them. Afterwards I attempted a variety of metres in my leisure moments, and principally when travelling. At last I determined, in accordance with the example set by many, to complete one separate volume of hendecasyllables, nor do I repent having done so. It is read, transcribed, indeed sung, and accompaniedby the Greeks, too, whom their relish for this little book has taught Latinsometimes on the guitar, at other times on the lyre. But why talk so big ? How- ever, poets are privileged to rave. And yet I do not speak from my own but from others' judgments, who, whether they judge rightly or wrongly, at any rate delight me. I only pray that posterity likewise may judge, whether rightly or wrongly, in the same way. (5-) To Calpuenia, his Wife. It is incredible what a yearning for you possesses me. The reason of this is first of all my love for you, and next that we have not been accustomed to be separated. Hence it is that I spend a great part of my nights wake- ful over your image ; hence in the day, at the times when I was in the habit of looking in on you, my feet of their own accord take meas the phrase runs most trulyto your apartment ; hence in the end, sick at heart and sad, as one who has been denied admittance, I retire from the deserted threshold. One time alone is free from these torments, that in which I am worn out in the Forum by the law-suits of my friends. It is for you to judge what my life must be when it finds its repose in labour, its solace in miseries and cares ! (6.) To Macrinus. A strange and remarkable circumstance has happened to Varenus,* though it be still of an uncertain character. The Bithynians are reported to have given up his prosecution on the ground of its having been undertaken without consideration. Eeported, do I say ? The agent of the province is here, and has brought a decree of its council to Csesar, to many of our leading men, and to us, the advocates of Varenus, into the bargain. Still, that same Magnus holds out ; more than this, he worries with the utmost pertinacity the worthy Nigrinus, through whom he made application to the consuls that Varenus should be ordered to produce his accounts. I assisted Varenus, but now only as a friend, having made up my mind to hold my tongue. For nothing could be more disadvan- * See Letters v. 20 and vi. 13. BOOK VIL 223 tageous than that I, appointed his advocate by the Senate, should defend, as though lying under an accusation, a person to whom it imported that he should appear not to be accused at all. However, when at the close of Nigri- nus's application the consuls turned their eyes towards me, \" You will know,\" said I, \" that I have good reason for my silence when you have heard the real agents of the pro- vince.\" In answer to this, \"To whom have they been sent ? \" asked Nigrinus. Said I, \" To tne, as well as to others. I am in possession of the decree of the province.\" To which he returned, \" You may feel satisfied.\" I replied, \" If you are satisfied the other way, it is possible that I, too, may be satisfied, and with better reason.\" Upon this the provincial agent, PolyjEuus, set forth the grounds for annulling the prosecution, and demanded that there should be no prejudgment of the matter in view of Cajsar's cog- nisance of it. Magnus spoke in reply, and Polysenus a second time. For my part, merely interspersing an occa- sional and brief remark, I observed in general a profound silence. For I have learnt that there are times when it is no less the part of an orator to hold his tongue than to speak. And I can even remember that in the case of cer- tain persons capitally accused, I have served them still better by my silence than by the most elaborate oratory. A mother who had lost her son (for what prohibits me, though my reason for writing this letter was a differ- ent one, from discussions of a professional kind?) accused to the prince his freedmen, who were also co-heirs with her, of forgery and poisoning, and obtained Julius Servianus for judge. I defended the accused, and that too in a very crowded court ; for the case attracted great notice, and, besides, the most celebrated talent was employed on either side. The trial ended by the slaves being put to the question,* and the result was in favour of the accused. Subsequently the mother applied to the prince, declaring that she had discovered fresh evidence. Suburanus was directed to hear the case thus decided, reargued, in the event of her producing any new matter. The mother's counsel was Julius Africanus, a grandson of that orator after hearing whom Passienus Crispus exclaimed, \" Finely spoken, by Hercules, finely spoken ! But to what end all this fine speaking ? \" This orator's grandson, a young man of talent, but not much judgment, after he had talked at great length and filled up the time allotted him, \" I beg,\" said he, \" Suburanus, that you would permit me to add just one word.\" Then I, when all were looking to me with the expectation of hearing a long reply, spoke thus, \" I should have replied, if Africanus had added just that ' one word,' which, I doubt not, would have contained all his new matter.\" I cannot readily call to mind having ever ob- tained so much approval by speaking, as I did then by not speaking. Similarly on the present occasion I was lauded and welcomed for having so far held my tongue on behalf of Varenus.* The consuls, in accordance with the appli- cation of Polysenus, have kept the whole matter open for the prince, whose decision I await in suspense. For, the day when it is given will either put us at rest and at ease for Varenus, or will force us to resume our in- terrupted labours with renewed anxiety. {?) To Satueninus. I thanked our friend Prisons lately, and have done so againsince you so bade mewith the greatest pleasure. It is indeed particularly delightful to me that two such excellent men and dear friends of mine should be so knit together as to think yourselves under a reciprocal obliga- tion. For he, too, professes to derive the highest gratifi- cation from your intimacy, and engages with you in a truly noble contest of mutual affection, which time itself * Eactenns tacui. Keil reads hactenus non tacui, which gives a very forced sense. BOOK VII. I am sorry to hear tliat you are engrossed by business, for this reason, that you are unable to devote yourself to literature. However, when you have concluded one case before a judge, and (as you tell me) settled the other in person, you will begin, first, to enjoy your leisure where you are, and then, when you have had enough of it, to think of returning to us. (8.) To Pkiscus. I cannot express my delight at our friend Saturninus speaking to me of his deep thankfulness to you in letter after letter. Go on as you have begun, and cherish with all possible affection this excellent man, from whose friendship you will derive great satisfaction, and for no short time either; for abounding as he is in all good qualities, he is principally distinguished for the remarkable constancy of his affections. (9.) To Fuscus. You ask me after what manner I think you ought to pursue your studies in the retirement which you have now for some time enjoyed. . It will be particularly profitable and so it is laid down by many -to translate either from Greek into Latin, or from Latin into Greek. This is a kind of exercise which will furnish you with propriety and brilliancy of expression, a great supply of ornamental turns, force in exposition, and, moreover, by imitation of the best models, a faculty of inventing what will resemble them. At the same time, what might have eluded the notice of a reader cannot escape a translator. By this means taste and judgment are acquired. It will do you no harm iftaking what you have read with sufficient atten- p PLINY S LETTERS. tion to recollect the matter and the argumentyou write down the substance in a spirit of rivalry, and then compare it with what you have read, carefully considering what you and what your author have put in a preferable way. Great will be your joy if you have bettered him in some places; great your shame if he has bettered you in every- thing. It will sometimes be permissible to select the best known parts, and to compete with the choicest passages. This contest, though a daring one, will not be impertinent, because it is carried on in private. Though, for the matter of that, we see many who have undertaken this kind of competition with great credit, and who, by reason of not despairing, have outstripped those whom they thought it sufficient to follow in the wake of. You may also take in hand again what you have written, after you have forgotten it, and then retain much of it, throw out more, insert some things, and rewrite others. This is an irksome and extremely tedious task, but which the difficulty itself renders profitableto warm to one's work afresh, and resume one's swing after it has been enfeebled and has ceased, and, finally, to insert fresh members, so to speak, in a completed framework, yet so as not to disturb what was there before. I know that just now you have a particular affection for oratory, but I would not on that account advise you always to adopt that contentious, ar\\d, if I may so term it, warlike style. For as soils are refreshed by varying and changing the seeds, so are our minds by exercising the thoughts now in one direction, now in another. I should wish you occasionally to take up some historical topic. I should a' so wish you to write a letter with especial pains, Eor oftentimes, even in an oration, a necessity occurs, not only for historical, but almost for poetical treatment, and a concise and pure style is acquired by letter-writing. Even poetry is a fitting relaxation, I don't say long and sustained poems (for such as these can only be elaborated with full leisure), but of that lively and short kind which BOOK VII. 227 form a suitable interruption to occupations and business, however important. We call them poetic sports. But these sports sometimes attain to no less fame than serious effusions. Nay, more (for why should I not exhort you to verse-making by verse ?) : -As yielding wax the artist's skill commands, Submissive shaped beneath his forming hands ; Now dreadful stands in arms a Mars confessed, Or now with Veniis' softer air impressed ; Now by the mould a wanton Cupid lies, j Now shines, severely chaste, a Pallas wise ; As not alone to quench the sacred flame The sacred fountain pours her friendly stream, But sweetly gliding through the flowery green, Spreads glad refreshment o'er the smiling scene ; So, formed by science, should the ductile mind Receive, distinct, each various art refined.* And so the greatest orators, who were at the same time the greatest of men, either exercised or delighted them- selves, nay, rather both exercised and delighted themselves. For it is marvellous how, by means of these small com- positions, the mind is at once exerted and refreshed. There is room in them for love, hatred, wrath, pity, humour, everything, in short, which has a place in daily life, as well as in the Forum and its trials. There is in these, too, the same advantage as in other kinds of poetry, that, after acquitting ourselves of the necessities imposed by metre, we learn to rejoice in the freedom of prose, and that which comparison shows to be the easier for us we write with all the more pleasure. You have now got, perhaps, even more than you required. One thing, however, has been omitted, for 1 have not said what I thought you ought to read, and yet I did say it when telling you what ought to be written. Do you mind and make a careful selection of authors, each of his own kind. For they say that one ought to read much, not many things. \"Who these authors are is so well-known and established that there is no necessity for pointing them out ; and, independently of this, I have so immoderately extended this letter, that, while advising you on the way in which you ought to conduct your studies, I have been robbing you of time for study. Eesume, then, your note-books, and either write something in accordance with these suggestions, or go on with the particular work you had begun. (lO.) To Macrinus. As I myself, when I have learnt the beginning of a story, long to tack to it the ending, which has in a manner been forcibly separated from it, so I suppose that you too would like to learn the remainder about Varenus and the Bithynians.* The cause was pleaded by Polysenus on one side, and Magnus on the other. At the conclusion of their speeches, \" Neither party,\" said Caesar, \" shall have to complain of delay ; it shall be my care to ascertain the wishes of the province.\" Meanwhile Varenus has obtained a good deal. For, indeed, how doubtful it must be whether a man is rightly accused, when it is uncertain whether he be accused at all? All that remains is that the province should not once more approve of what it is said to have condemned, and thus repent of its own repentance. (II.) To Fabatus, his Wife's Geandfather. You are surprised that Hermes, my freedman, should have sold to Corellia the five-twelfth share which was left me in an estate (without waiting for the auction, though I had ordered the property to be advertised), at the rate of * See Letter 6 of this Book. BOOK VII. seven hundred thousand sesterces for the whole.* You add that the estate could be sold for nine hundred thou- sand,j-and hence you are more particular in inquiring whether I am prepared to stand by what he has done. I certainly do stand by it, for reasons you will now learn, for I am anxious that you should approve, and my co-heirs should excuse, my separating myself from them under the compulsion of a still higher obligation. I have a regard and profound respect for Corellia, first of all as being the sister of Corellius Eufus, whose memory is in the highest degree sacred in my eyes, and next as the bosom friend of my mother. Ties of long standing unite me to her husband also, Minicius Justus, a man of the loftiest character, and very strong ones united me to her son, to such an extent indeed that, during my Prsetorship, he presided at the shows which I gave. Corellia, when I was lately in those parts, intimated to me her desire to own some property upon our Larian lake. I offered her, out of my estates, anything she liked, at her own price, always excepting what had come to me from my mother and father, for I could not part with these, even to Corellia. So when this inheritance had fallen to me, containing the lands in question, I wrote to her that they would be offered for sale. Hermes was the bearer of my letter, and on her urgently requesting that he would at once dispose of my portion to her, he complied. to that which has been done by my freedman in compli- ance with my sentiments. It remains that my co-heirs should bear with a good grace my having sold separately what I was entitled not to sell at all. Nor, indeed, are they compelled to imitate my example, for there are not the same ties between them and Corellia. They can, therefore, look to their own interests ; mine were replaced by a sense of friendship. (12.) To MiNicius. The enclosed small production was composed by me at your request for your, nay, rather our friend (for what is there that is not common between us ?), to use if occasion requires. I have sent it you later than I otherwise should, in order that you may have no time for correcting it, that is to say, pulling it to pieces. However, you will find time, whether for correcting it I know not, but cer- tainly for pulling it to pieces. For you \" gentlemen of correct taste \" cut out all the best bits. Well, if you do this, I will take it in good part. For I shall afterwards, on some occasion or other, use these same bits on my own account, and obtain applause for them by favour of your contemptuous rejection of themas, for instance, that passage which you will find marked, and the sense set out in a different way, in what I have written above it : for suspect- ing that it would seem to you turgid, inasmuch as it is high-sounding and elevated, I thought it not inopportune (in order to spare you torture) to append to it forthwith something conciser and simpler, or rather commoner and worse, but which, in your judgment, will be more appro- priate. Why, in sooth, should I not take every opportunity of pursuing and railing at your flimsy taste ? So much, that amidst your occupations you might for once have something to laugh at. What follows is serious. Be sure you repay me the expenses which have come out of my pocket for the special messenger sent herewith. But doubtless, after reading this, you will condemn, not parts of the book only, but the whole book, and, when asked for the price of it, will declare that it is worth no price at all ! BOOK VII. To Ferox. One and the same letter of yours intimates to me thai you are, and that you are not, engaged in literary studies Do I talk enigmas ? So it must be till I express my meaning more clearly. For while it denies that you are studying, it is so elegant that it could only have been written by a student ; or else you are the most fortunate of men if you can turn out such compositions as these as the fruits of idleness and leisure.

(16.) To Fabatus, his Wife's Geandfathee. I have an intimate regard for Calestrius Tiro, who is attached to me both by private and public ties. We served in the army together, and we were Csesar's Quaes- tors together. He preceded me in the tribuneship, in virtue of his having children,* but I overtook him in the prsetorship -Csesar having remitted me a year.t I have often enjoyed the retirement of his country seats, and he has often recovered his health at my house. He is now, in the capacity of Proconsul, about to go to the province of Bsetica, by way of Ticinum. I hope, nay, am confident, that I shall easily prevail on him to turn out of his way and visit you, if it be your wish to liberate in regular form the slaves whom you have recently manumitted in the presence of your friends.j You need not be at all afraid * By the Lex Papia Poppsea a + In his capacity of Proconsul candidate with several children was Calestrius Tiro would be able to give preferred to one with fewer or none, legal effect to this informal act of ) That is, having allowed me to manumission, serve the office of Praetor a year be- fore I was properly eligible.

Lay aside, then, that excessive diffidence of yours, and consult your own wishes. It is as agreeable to him to do my bidding as it is to me to do yours. (I7-) To Celee. Every one has his own reasons for reciting. Mine, as I have already often said, is this, that in case anything escapes my notice (as certainly things do escape), I may be warned of the fact. And this makes me wonder the more at your writing that there have been some who blamed me for reciting my orations at allunless, indeed they think that these are the only compositions which' need no correction. Qf these people I should be glad to inquire why they admit (if, however, they do admit) that a history ought to be recited, which is composed, not with a view to display, but to fidelity and truth ? Or why a tragedy, which requires, not a recitation chamber, but a stage and actors ? Or why lyric poetry, which requires, not a reader, but the chorus and the lyre ? \" Oh, but the recitation of these kind of things is now a received usage.\" Pray, then, is the person to be blamed who originated it ? Though, by the way, orations too have often been read aloud both by our countrymen and by the Greeks. \" At any rate, it is a work of supererogation to recite what you have already spoken.\" Granted, if you recite exactly the same thing, to precisely the same people, without a moment's delay. If, however, you make many additions and many changes, if you invite to hear you some fresh people, together with some of those who have heard you before (after an interval, however), why should your reasons for reading aloud what you have already spoken be less acceptable than for publishing the same ? \" But it is difficult for an oration to give satisfaction when recited.\" PLINY'S LETTERS. \"Well, but this is a point which concerns the pains taken by the reciter, not the reasons for not reciting. Nor, indeed, do I seek approval while reciting, but while being read. Consequently, I neglect no means of improvement. First of all, I go carefully over what I have written by myself ; next I read it to two or three people ; then I hand it over to others to make their notes on it, and these notes, when in any doubt, I again ponder in company with one or other of them. Last of all, I recite to a larger audience, and, if you will believe me, then it is that I am keenest at correcting ; for the ardour of my application is proportioned to my anxiety. Indeed, respect for one's audience and a sense of diffidence are the best of critics. Take it in this way : are you not less perturbed if you are going to address some one person, who, however great his culture, is still a single individual, than if you are going to address a number of people, even though they be uncultured? Do you not, on ris- ing to plead, nlistrust yourself, particularly at that moment ; at that moment desire, not merely that many things, but that everything in your speech could be changed ? And that still more strongly if the scene be enlarged and the circle of hearers extended ? For we look with apprehension even upon the common folk in their dusky attire. Are you notif you fancy any part of your opening to be unfavourably receivedat once discouraged and prostrated ? I presume this is because, in numbers themselves, there is a certain weighty and collective judgment ; and while each indivi- dual has but a small critical faculty, yet, taken altogether, they have a great deal. Hence Pomponius Secundushe was a writer of tragediesif there chanced to be any passage which one of his intimate friends thought of a nature to be left out, while he himself thought it should be retained, used to say, \" I appeal to the public ! \" And accordingly, judging from the silence or the approval of the public, he followed either his own or his friend's opinion. Such importance did he attach to this same public ; rightly or wrongly, does not concern me j for it is BOOK VII. 235 not my custom to invite the public, but persons I am sure of and have selected, whom I can look at and trust, whom I can scrutinise singly, and stand in awe of collectively. For M. Cicero's opinion about the pen I hold with regard to fear. Apprehension is the sharpest corrector. The very fact that we reflect we are about to recite acts as a corrector ; our entrance into the audience-room, the act of growing pale, our shivering, our looking about us, all these are so many correctors. Consequently, I am not ashamed of my habit, which experience shows me to be a most useful one, and, so far from being deterred by these people's tittle-tattle, I will go further, and ask you if you can tell me of anything to be added to all this. Nothing, indeed, will satisfy my precautions ; for I reflect what an important matter it is to deliver anything into the hands of men ; and I cannot persuade myself that it is not proper to revise often, and in the company of many, that which one desires should give pleasure at all times and to all people. (18.) To Caninius. You ask my opinion in what way the money which you have offered to our townsfolk for an annual feast may be secured after your decease. While the inquiry does you honour, the decision is not an easy one. Suppose you pay the amount to the municipality? It is to be feared that it may be squandered. Suppose you give land ? Being public land, it will be neglected. For my part, I can find nothing better than what I did myself. In lieu of five hundred thousand sesterces,* which I had promised for the maintenance of free boys and girls, I made over to the agent of the public property some lands of mine of much greater value ; these I had reconveyed to me on condition of paying thirty thousand sesterces f * About £4cxx>. See Book i. Letter 8. f About £240. annually as a rent-charge. In this way the capital of the municipality was made safe and the income was assured ; the land itself, in consequence of there being a large margin over the rent-charge, will always find an owner to cultivate it. I am aware that this cost me something more than the amount of my nominal donation, as the lien of the rent-charge has diminished the selling price of a very handsome property. But one is bound to prefer public to private interests, those that are enduring to those that are mortal, and to be much more careful in securing one's benefactions than one's property. (19.) To Pkiscus. The illness of Fannia torments me. She contracted it while nursing Junia the vestal virgin, originally of her own accord (indeed they are related), and subsequently being further commissioned to do so by the Pontifices ; for the virgins, when compelled by violent disease to remove from the court of Vesta's temple, are handed over to the care and custody of married ladies. While Fannia was carefully discharging the office in question, she became involved in this peril. The attacks of fever stick to her, her cough grows upon her, she is in the highest degree emaciated and enfeebled. Only her great soul and spirit in every way worthy of her husband Helvidius and her father Thrasearetain their vigour ; all else is breaking up in such a way as to prostrate me not merely with appre- hension, but with grief as well. Indeed, I do grieve that such an illustrious woman should be snatched from the gaze of the country, which may perhaps never look upon her like again. Oh, what purity was hers ! what holiness of life ! what nobility of character ! what intrepidity of soul ! Twice she followed her husband into exile, and a third time was herself banished on her husband's account ; for when Senecio was accused of having written certain BOOK VII. 237 publications on tlie life of Helvidius, and had said, in the course of his defence, that he had been requested to do so by Fanuia, upon Mettius Cams asking her, in a menacing tone,'' \" whether she had so requested him,\" she replied, \" I did make the request.\" \"Had she furnished him with memoranda for the composition ? \" \"I did furnish him.\" \" Was this with the knowledge of her mother ? \" \" Without her knowledge.\" In short, not a word did she utter that quailed before the peril. Moreover, she preserved copies of these very publications after the confiscation of her property (though through the exigencies and the terror of that epoch they had been suppressed by a decree of the Senate), kept them, and carried into her exile the cause of her exile. At the same time she is so pleasant, she is so friendly, and, in shortthe privilege of but fewas lovable as she is venerable. Will there be any woman left whom we may hereafter point out to our wives ? Will there be any one from whom we may take an example even of manly fortitude ? whom, while we still see her and hear her, we may admire as we do the women one reads about ? Tor my part, it seems to me as though her very house were tottering and about to fall torn from its foundationsand this though she still has descendants. For how great must be their virtues and how great their deeds in order to make it clear that she has not perished the last of her race ! And there is this additional cause of affliction and torment for me, that I seem to be losing her mother over againthat mother of such a woman ; what more illustrious name can I give her ?whom Fannia, as she resembles and recalls to us, so she will take away with her, afflicting me at one and the same time with a fresh and a re-opened wound. I frequented them both and cherished them both ; which of them in a greater degree I know not, nor did they desire that a difference should be made. They had my services in prosperity and they had them in adversity. I was their consoler when tliey -were banished and their avenger when they returned. Yet I did not fully acquit my debt to them, and for this reason am all the more anxious that Fannia should be spared in order that time may be left me for payment. Such are the cares amidst which I have written to you, and if any god shall turn them to joy, I will not complain of my fright. For not only is it my habit to tell the truth, but it is also yours to hear it willingly. Indeed, there are none who submit more patiently to correction than those who are most deserving of praise. And now, I am expecting from you my book with your notes. What a delightful and charming interchange ! How it rejoices me that, should posterity take any heed of us at all, it will be universally related in what concord, with what sincerity and fidelity to each other, we lived. It will be a rare and memorable thing for two men pretty nearly equals in points of age and station, and not altogether without a name in litera- ture (I am compelled, you see, to speak in somewhat scant terms of you as well, inasmuch as I am speaking of my- self at the same time), each to have furthered the studies of the other. For my part, when I was but a stripling, while you were already flourishing in renown and glory, I yearned to follow after youboth to be accounted and to be \" second to you, though great the space between.\" Yet there were in existence many men of brilKant genius ; nevertheless you seemed to me, owing to the similarity of our dispositions, to be the one most capable of being imitated, and most worthy of imitation. I the more rejoice then that, whenever the conversation turns on BOOK VIL 239 intellectual pursuits, we are named together, that to people speaking about you my name at once presents itself. Not but what there are some who are preferred to both of us. But it does not matter to me what place is assigned us, provided we are thus conjoined ; for in my estimation to come next to you is to be before all the rest. Moreover, you must have noticed that in wills (unless a testator should happen to be especially intimate with one or the other of us) we receive the same bequests, and in each other's company. All which goes to this, that our mutual affection should be the more ardent when so many are the bonds which constrain us by our studies, our characters, our reputations, and, finally, by the last dis- positions of mankind. (21.) To COENUTTJS. I am all obedience, my dearest colleague, and am attend- ing, as you bid me, to the weakness in my eyes. For I came here in a close carriage, shut in on all sides as in a bedroom, and am abstaining herewith difficulty, but still abstainingnot only from the use of my pen, but even from reading, and study only through my ears. By drawing a curtain, I cause my chamber to be shaded without being darkened. The cloister,* too, by covering up the lower part of the windows, enjoys as much shade as sun. In this way I am carefully learning by degrees to bear the light. I take baths because they are of service, and wine because it does me no harmvery sparingly, however; so I have habituated myself, and now there is some one by me to watch me.f The present of a fowl, as coming from you, was most acceptable; and though still weak of sight, I had eyes sharp enough to see that it was an extremely plump one. (22.) To Falco. You will be less surprised at my having been so per- sistent in begging you to confer a tribuneship upon a friend of mine when you know who and what he is. For now that you have given me your promise, I am able to tell you his name and to describe the personage, Cornelius Minicianus is the man, an ornament to my native district both in position and character. Of illustrious birth and ample fortune, he is as much devoted to study as poor men are wont to be.* At the same time he is a most upright judge, a most undaunted advocate, and a most faithful friend. You will think that a favour has been conferred on you when you have made more intimate acquaintance with a man who is at any rate equal (for I do not wish to speak too boastfully of one who is himself so modest) to any honours and to any titles.f (Anon, n.d.) To Fabatus, his Wife's Geandfathek. While I rejoice at your being strong enough to go and meet Tiro at Mediolanum,! yet that you may continue to preserve that strength, I would beg you not to impose on yourself so great a fatigue, which is opposed to the consideration of your time of life. Nay, further, I enjoin on you to wait for him at home, and, what is more, inside your house, and even inside your chamber. For truly, since he is cherished by me as a brother, he ought not to exact from one whom I look up to as a father an attention which he would have excused in the case of his own father. * i.e., as those who are required, on him, he will be found, if not by want of means, to labour at a pro-superior (for I don't wish to puff him fession. unduly), at any rate equal to them. + The stress is on \"equal\" (jparem). J Milan, See vii, i6. \"Whatever honours may be conferred BOOK VII. 241 (24-) To Geminus, Ummidia Quadratilla is dead, wanting a little of eighty years, but hale up to the time of her last illness, and with a compactness and vigour of frame surpassing that of matrons in general. She died leaving a will which reflected great credit on her. She made her grandson heir to two-thirds, and her granddaughter to the remaining third of her fortune. The granddaughter I know hut slightly, the grandson I have the strongest regard fora youth of singular merit, and one who deserved to be loved as a relation by others besides his blood connections. In the first place, though conspicuous for personal beauty, he escaped the gossip of the malevolent, both in boyhood and youth. In his four-and-twentieth year he was a husband, and, had the gods so willed it, would have become a father. In the society of a grandmother addicted to pleasure he lived a life of extreme steadiness, and yet of compliance with her wishes. She had pantomimists in her employ, and interested herself more warmly in them than became a woman of her high rank. Neither at the theatre nor at home did Quadratus witness the perform- ances of these men, and she did not require him to do so. I have heard her say herself, when commending to me her grandson's studious pursuits, that being a woman, with that want of occupation which is the lot of the sex, she was in the habit of relieving her mind by a game of draughts, or by watching the performances of her panto- mimists ; but that whenever she was about to do either of these things she always bade her grandson go off to his studies ; and she seemed to me to do this from a sense of v/hat was due to the youth as much as from her love for him. You will be astonished, and so was I. At the last sacerdotal games, a contest of pantomimists having been Q exhibited, as Quadratus and I were leaving the theatre together, said he to me, \" Do you know that to-day is the first time I ever saw a freedman of my grandmother's dancing!\" Thus the grandson. But, by Hercules, per- sons who were in no way connected with her, by way of doing honour to Quadratilla -I am ashamed of having said honourrather by way of discharging their office of toadieswere coursing about the theatre, and jumping and clapping their hands, and admiring and imitating every gesture for the benefit of their patroness, with an accompaniment of sing-song. And now these persons will receive the tiniest of legacies, as a gratuity for enacting the part of claqueurs, from an heir who was never a spec- tator of these performances. I have told you all this, because, when anything fresh turns up, you are in general not indisposed to hear it ; next, because it is a pleasure to me to renew any subject of joy by writing about it. And I do joy in the family affection shown by the deceased and in the honour paid to so excellent a young man. I am delighted, too, that the house which formerly belonged to C. Cassius (the man who was the chief and founder of the Cassian school) should be in possession of an owner in no way his inferior. Eor my friend Quadratus will worthily fill it and become it, and once more restore to it its ancient dignity, celebrity, and glory, since there will issue thence as great an orator as Cassius was a jurisconsult. (25.) To EuFus. What a number of learned men there are whom their own modesty or the stillness of their lives conceals and withdraws from fame ! Yet we, when about to speak or read in public, stand in apprehension of those only who advertise their learning, whereas such as hold their tongues show to advantage by their silent reverence for the noblest of pursuits. What I write is written from expe- rience. Terentius Junior, after serving irreproachably in the army, in Equestrian grades,* and also as Procurator of the province of Narbonian Gaul, has retired to his estate, preferring the prof oundest retirement to the honours which awaited him. Having been invited to his house, I regarded him as a worthy paterfamilias and a diligent farmer, and was prepared to talk to him on subjects with which I supposed him to be conversant. Indeed, I had begun to do so, when he, with the most learned discourse, recalled me to literature. How neatly he always expresses him- self ! in what Latin, in what Greek ! He is so strong in both languages that he seems chiefly to excel in the one he happens to speak at the moment. How great his reading, how great his memory ! You would think he lived at Athens, not in a country-house. In short, he has added to my apprehensions by causing me to be nervous in the presence of these secluded and, so to speak, rough countryfolk no less than in that of those whom I know for men of extensive learning. I advise you to the same effect. For just as in camps, so also in this literary arena of ours, there are a good many persons who, though not in uniform, will be found on a close inspection to be girded and armed, and that too wdth the sharpest of intellects. (26.) To Maximus. The illness of a, certain friend lately reminded me that we are best while we are sick. For what sick man is tempted either by avarice or lust ? Such an one is not the slave of his amours, has no appetite for honours, is neglectful of riches, and holds the smallest portion of them for enough, seeing that he is about to part with it. Then he remembers that there are gods and that he is a man ; he envies no one, admires no one, despises no one ; not even to malicious gossip will he pay attention or find food in it. His dreams are of baths and fountains. These form the sum of his anxieties, the sum of his aspirations ; he proposes to himself an easy and comfortable existence for the future, that is, a harmless and a happy one, if he has the luck to escape. What philosophers strive to teach with a multitude of words, and even in a multitude of volumes, I am able, therefore, to lay down for your benefit and my own thus briefly : in health we should continue to be such as, in sickness, we promise that we shall be. (2;.) To SUEA. Our leisure furnishes me with the opportunity of learning from you, and you with that of instructing me. Accord- ingly, I particularly wish to know whether you think there exist such things as phantoms, possessing an appear- ance peculiar to themselves, and a certain supernatural power, or that mere empty delusions receive a shape from our fears. For my part, I am led to believe in their existence, especially by what I hear happened to Curtius Eufus. While still in humble circumstances and obscure, he was a hanger-on in the suite of the governor of Africa. While pacing the colonnade one afternoon, there appeared to him a female form of superhuman size and beauty. She informed the terrified man that she was \" Africa,\" and had come to foretell future events ; for that he would go to Eome, would fill offices of state there, and would even return to that same province with the highest powers, and die in it. All which things were fulfilled. Moreover, as he touched at Carthage, and was disembarking from his ship, the same form is said to have presented itself to him on the shore. It is certain that, being seized with illness, BOOK VIL 245 and auguring the future from the past, and misfortune from his previous prosperity, he himself abandoned all hope of life, though none of those about him despaired. Is not the following story again still more appalling and not less marvellous ? I will relate it as it was received by me : -There was at Athens a mansion, spacious and com- modious, but of evil repute and dangerous to health. In the dead of night there was a noise as of iron, and, if you listened more closely, a clanking of chains was heard, first of all from a distance, and afterwards hard by. Presently a spectre used to appear, an ancient man sinking with emaciation and squalor, with a long beard and bristly hair, wearing shackles on his legs and fetters on his hands, and shaking them. Hence the inmates, by reason of their fears, passed miserable and horrible nights in sleeplessness. This want of sleep was followed by disease, and, their terrors increasing, by death. For in the daytime as well, though the apparition had departed, yet a reminiscence of it flitted before their eyes, and their dread outlived its cause. The mansion was accordingly deserted, and, con- demned to solitude, was entirely abandoned to the dread- ful ghost. . However, it was advertised, on the chance of some one, ignorant of the fearful curse attached to it, being willing to buy or to rent it, Athenodorus, the philosopher, came to Athens and read the advertisement. When he had been informed of the terms, which were so low as to appear suspicious, he made inquiries, and learnt the whole of the particulars. Yet none the less on that account, nay, all the more readily, did he rent the house. As evening began to draw on, he ordered a sofa to be set for himself in the front part of the house, and called for his note-books, writing implements, and a light. The whole of his servants he dismissed to the interior apartments, and for himself applied his soul, eyes, and hand to composition, that his mind might not, from want of occupation, picture to itself the phantoms of which he had heard, or any empty terrors. At the commencement there was the universal silence of night. Soon the shaking of irons and the clanking of chains was heard, yet he never raised his eyes nor slackened his pen, but hardened his soul and deadened his ears by its help. The noise grew and approached : now it seemed to be heard at the door, and next inside the door. He looked round, beheld and recognised the figure he had been told of. It was standing and signalling to him with its finger, as though inviting him. He, in reply, made a sign with his hand that it should wait a moment, and applied himself afresh to his tablets and pen. Upon this the figure kept rattling its chains over his head as he wrote. On looking round again, he saw it making the same signal as before, and without delay took up a light and followed it. It moved with a slow step, as though oppressed by its chains, and, after turning into the courtyard of the house, vanished suddenly and left his company. On being thus left to himself, he marked the spot with some grass and leaves which he plucked. ISText day he applied to the magistrates, and urged them to have the spot in question dug up. There were found there some bones attached to and intermingled with fetters ; the body to which they had belonged, rotted away by time and the soil, had abandoned them thus naked and corroded to the chains. They were collected and interred at the public expense, and the house was ever afterwards free from the spirit, which had obtained due sepulture. The above story I believe on the strength of those who affirm it. What follows I am myself in a position to affirm to others. I have a freedman, who is not without some knowledge of letters. A younger brother of his was sleeping with him in the same bed. The latter dreamt he saw some one sitting on the couch, who approached a pair of scissors to his head, and even cut the hair from the crown of it. When day dawned he was found to be cropped round the crown, and his locks were discovered BOOK VII. A lad of mine was sleeping, in company with several others, in the pages' apartment. There came through the windows (so he tells the story) two figures in white tunics, who cut his hair as he lay, and departed the way they came. In his case, too, daylight exhibited him shorn, and his locks scattered around. Nothing remarkable followed, except, perhaps, this, that I was not brought under accusa- tion, as I should have been, if Domitian (in whose reign these events happened) had lived longer. For in his desk was found an information against me which had been presented by Carus ; from which circumstance it may be conjecturedinasmuch as it is the custom of accused persons to let their hair grow that the cutting off of my slaves' hair was a sign of the danger which threatened me being averted. I beg, then, that you will apply your great learning to this subject. The matter is one which deserves long and deep consideration on your part ; nor am I, for my part, undeserving of having the fruits of your wisdom imparted to me. You may even argue on both sides (as your w^ay is), provided you argue more forcibly on one side than the other, so as not to dismiss me in suspense and anxiety, when the very cause of my consulting you has been to have my doubts put an end to. (28.) To Septicius. You say that certain folks have been finding fault with me in your presence, on the ground of my praising my friends immoderately at every opportunity. I plead guilty to the charge, and even hug it to my breast. What indeed can be more to one's credit than the sin of good- nature ? Yet who are these people who know my friends better than I do ? However, suppose they do so know them, why grudge me a deception which is the cause of so much happiness to me ? Tor though these friends be not such as they are proclaimed by me, yet I am fortunate in that they seem such to me. Let these persons, then, transfer their mischievous assiduities elsewhere. There is no lack of those who malign their friends under the plea of criticising them, ife they will never persuade to think that my friends are too much loved by me. (29-) To MONTANUS. You will laugh, then you will be indignant, then you will laugh again, when you read what, unless you do read it, you never will believe. There stands on the road to Tibur, this side of the first milestone -I noticed it quite latelya monument to Pallas,* thus inscribed : \" To him, the Senate, on account of his faithfulness and loyalty to his patrons, decreed the Praetorian insignia and a sum of fifteen million sesterces.f He was contented with the honour merely.\" In truth, I have never marvelled to see honours bestowed more frequently by fortune than by discernment; yet this inscription strongly reminded me how farcical and foolish are those which are at times thrown away on such dirt and filth as this ; honours which, to crown the matter, this gallows-bird was impudent enough both to accept and to decline, and even, as a sample of modesty, to exhibit to posterity. But why this indignation ? It is better to laugh, that these rogues may not fancy they have achieved any mighty result, when their good luck has merely carried them to the point of being subjects for laughter. * A freedman and favourite of the Emperor Claudius. t About £120,000. BOOK VII. To Genitoe. I am mucli distressed at your having lost, as you write me word, a pupil of the highest promise. That his illness and death have impeded your studies is of course obvious to me, since you are so careful in the discharge of all friendly offices, and love with so much effusion all those who approve themselves to you. As for me, city business pursues me even to this place. For there are not wanting those who constitute me judge or arbitrator in their affairs. To this must be added the complaints of the rustics, who abuse my ears, as they have a right to do after my long absence. Then there is a pressing necessity for letting my farms, and a very disagreeable one, so rare is it to find suitable tenants. For these reasons I study when I can beg time ; still I do study ; for I both write and read somewhat. Yet, when reading, I am made sensible by the comparison how bad my own writings are ; though you put good heart into me when you compare my treatise in vindication of Helvidius to the oration of Demosthenes against Midias. It is true that I had the latter in my hands while engaged in composing the former; not with the view of rivalling it (that would have been impudence, and almost madness) ; yet, at any rate, with the view of imitating and following it, as far as the divergence be- tween the two intellectsbetween a very great and a very small oneand the different character of my case would permit. (Anon, n.d.) To COENUTUS. Claudius Pollio desires your affection, and deserves it from the very fact that he desires it, and next because he 2SO PLINY'S LETTERS. loves you of liis own accord. And, indeed, none commonly claims this kind of sentiment, save lie who himself experi- ences it. He is, besides, a man of virtue and integrity, free from ambition and modest to excessif, however, any one can carry modesty to excess. AYhen we served together, I saw what he was made of, and that not merely in the capacity of his comrade in arms. He commanded a squadron of cavalry a thousand strong. I was ordered by the Consular Legate to examine the accounts of the squadrons and cohorts, in the course of which I discovered, not only the extensive and filthy rapacity of certain parties, but also the consummate integrity and scrupulous industry of my friend. Promoted subsequently to the most distinguished charges, he was seduced by no oppor- tunity to deviate from his innate regard for disinterested- ness. He was never puffed up by prosperity ; never by reason of the variety of offices which he filled did he detract ought from his unvarying reputation for kindli- ness ; and he supported his labours with the same strength of character as that with which he now bears his repose. This repose, however, he has, for a short time, greatly to his credit, broken in upon and laid aside, having been called to assist our friend Corellius, in consequence of the liberality of the Emperor Nerva, in the matter of buying and distributing lands for the public. What a glory, to be sure, to have especially attracted the choice of so dis- tinguished a man, when there was such an ample field for selection. For the regard and the fidelity with which he cherishes his friends, you may trust to the last testamen- tary dispositions of many among them, and of this number Annius Bassus, a man of the highest respectability. The memory of this Bassus he preserves and prolongs by eulogies, which are, indeed, so full of gratitude, that he has published (for letters too, as well as the other liberal arts, are held in veneration by him) a volume containing his life. A noble thing this, and one to be approved for its very rarity, seeing that most people remember the dead just BOOK VII. 251 so far as to complain of them.* This man, who, believe me, is so eager for your friendship, I would have you receive Avith open arms and cling to, ay, and welcome, and so love him as though you were repaying a favour. For in the office of friendship, he who has set the example is not one to he placed under an obligation, but rather to be remunerated. (Anon, n.d.) To Tabatus, his Wife's Gkandfathek.

For I desire that our native place should be increased in all things, but prin- cipally in the number of its citizens, since this forms the surest embellishment of cities. This, too, pleases menot that I curry favourbut, at any rate, it does please me, to see you add that both you and I were honoured by the expression of thanks and by praise. For, as Xeno- phon says, \" Praise is the sweetest hearing,\" particularly if you think you deserve it. To Tacitus. I augur, nor does my augury deceive me, that your histories will be immortal, hence all the more (I will candidly confess it) do I desire to find a place in them.

Gierig f See Letters 16 and 23 of this and Doering prefer the sense, \"re-Book, ought \"we not to desire that our deeds may be favoured with a writer and eulogist such as you ? I will indicate to you, then, a matter which cannot, however, have escaped your diligence, since it is in the public records ; I will indicate it, notwithstanding, that you may the more readily believe how agreeable it will be to me if a deed of mine, the credit of which was increased by its danger, should be set off by your genius and your testimony. The Senate had assigned me, in company with Herennius Senecio, as counsel for the province of Bsetica, against Bcebius Massa, and, on the conviction of Massa, had decreed that his property should be in the custody of the state. Senecio, having ascertained that the Consuls would be at liberty to hear applications, came to me and said, \" In the same spirit of harmony in which we have carried out the prosecution enjoined on us, let us go to the Consuls, and beg them not to suffer the property to be squandered which they ought to remain in charge of.\" I replied, \"As we were appointed counsel by the Senate, consider whether our functions have not been discharged, now that the Senate has concluded its investifration.\" Said he, \" Do you impose any limit on yourself that you choose, since there is no tie between you and the province except your own good service, and that a recent one. As for me, I was both born and have served as a Quaestor in it.\" Thereupon I replied, \" If this be your fixed determination, I will follow you, that if by chance any odium comes of it, it may not be confined to you.\" We went to the Consuls, and Senecio spoke what the matter comported, to which I subjoined a few remarks. We had scarcely .finished speaking, when Massa, crying out that Senecio was satisfying, not his engagement as an advocate, but his acrimony as a personal enemy, accused him of treason.* All stood aghast. I, however, said, \"I am afraid, most * Jmpietas. Some of the commenfrom being squandered, contained, or tators suppose that an application to might be held to imply, a reflection prevent the property (which was now on the Emperor (Domitian). in the nominal charge of the public) BOOK VII. noble Consuls, tliat Massa by his silence mnst have taunted me with collusion, in that he did not accuse me too of treason.\" This saying of mine was immediately taken up and afterwards much noised abroad. The late Emperor Nerva (for even while in a private station he paid attention to exhibitions of uprightness in public affairs), in a very weighty communication which he addressed to me, congratulated not only me, but the age, on being blessed with an example (it was thus that he wrote) of the antique kind. All this, whatever its value, you will make better known, more celebrated, of greater import, though I do not require you to exaggerate what really took place. For not only is history bound not to depart from truth, but also for worthy deeds the truth is quite sufficient. ( 254 ) BOOK VIII. To Septicius. I HAVE got to the end of my journey comfortably, with this exception, that some of my people have been rendered ill by the scorching heats. Encolpius, indeed, my reader, the delight of my serious as well as my sportive hours, had his throat so irritated by the dust that he spat blood. How sad this will be for himself, and how annoying to me, if one whose whole charm was derived from his literary pursuits, shall become unfitted for those pursuits ! More- over, who will there be to read my small productions as he does, and to take such a pleasure in them as he takes ? However, the gods promise better fortune ; the spitting of blood has ceased, and the pain has subsided. Add to this that the salubrity of the climate, our country quarters, our retired life, hold out as good a prospect of health as of repose. (2.) To Calvisius. Others set out for their estates that they may return thence the richer ; I, that I may return the poorer. I had sold my vintages to certain dealers, who had bought them after a competition. They were attracted by the actual, as compared with the prospective price, and their expectations deceived them. The simple course was to make an equal remission all round ; but this would have been hardly fair. Now to me it seems in the highest degree excellent, as abroad so at liome, as in great things so in small, as in things foreign so in one's own, to be diligent in the practice of equity. For if our sins be all of equal importance, so must our good deeds be.* Accordingly, I remitted an eighth part of the purchase-money, and that to all, \"that none should leave without my bounty feeling ; \" f next, I had regard, separately, for those who had invested the largest sums in their purchases, for these had at the same time profited me more, and themselves suffered a greater loss. Hence, in the case of those who had bought for more than ten thousand sesterces,| to the above eighth part, which was common to all, and, so to speak, a public gift, I added a tenth part of the amount by which they had exceeded the ten thousand. I am afraid that I have not made myself sufficiently intelligible, and will explain my way of reckoning more clearly. Suppose any persons to have bought for fifteen thousand, § these would have got back not only an eighth of fifteen thousand, but a tenth of five thousand. Further, on reflecting that some had paid me a considerable portion of what they owed, others a trifle, others nothing at all, it seemed to me by no means just that those who were not on a level in the discharge of their obligations should be put on a level in regard to the favour of abatement.|| So, again, I remitted to those who had made payments a tenth part of that which they had paid. For this seemed the most fitting means, with reference to the past, of requiting them singly, in proportion to the deserts of each; and, with reference to the future, of enticing them not only to buy but to make payment. This calculation of mine, or this act of complaisance (whichever it may have been), cost me a large sum, but it was worth the outlay. For, through- out the whole district, both the novelty of this remission, and also its form, are applauded. Even the people them- selves, whom I treated, as the saying goes, not with one and the same measuring-rule, but with distinctions and gradations, left me all the more obliged to me, in pro- portion to the rectitude and probity of each, having experi- enced that it is not with me that -\" The good and bad an equal honour find.\" * (3-) To Spaesus. You intimate that the book I last sent you is of all my works the one which pleases you most. Such is also the opinion of a friend of mine, a man of profound learning. And this is an additional inducement to me to believe that neither of you are mistaken, because it is not credible that loth are mistaken, and because, in any case, I am ready to flatter myself. For I desire that my latest performances should always appear the most perfect, and hence, even at this moment, favouras against the above bookan oration which I have lately published, and which shall be communicated to you so soon as I shall find a careful messenger. I have aroused your expectations, which I fear that the oration, when you have it in hand, will disappoint. Meanwhile, however, expect it as though it would be sure to please youand perhaps it may please. (4.) To Canixius. You do admirably in preparing to write of the Dacian war. For where is the subject at the same time so recent, so abounding in incident, so vast, in short, so poetical, * Homer, Iliad ii, 319, andtliou\"li dealincr in events of the most real character so like fable ? You will tell of new rivers set flowing over the earth,* new bridges thrown over rivers, mountain precipices occupied by camps, of a king who had despaired of nothing driven out of his palace, ay, and driven out of his life ; besides this, of triumphs twice celebrated, one having been the first over a hitherto unconquered people, the other, the last. The single drawback, yet an important one, is, that to equal all this in description must be an immense and arduous task even for your genius, rising though it does to the loftiest heights, and growing in proportion to the vastness of its undertakings. And there must be not a little labour in this too, in preventing barbarous and savage names (among the first, that of the King himself) from showing their repugnance to Greek metre. But there is nothing which skill and attention will not mitigate, even though they may fail to overcome it. Moreover, if it is permitted to Homer to contract, lengthen, and alter names, both soft and Greek, to suit the smoothness of his verse, why should not a similar licence be permitted to you, particularly when it results not from affectation but from necessity ? Accordingly, poet-fashion, having in- voked the godsand among them limi whose acts and works and counsels you are about to relateloosen your ropes, spread your sails, and be carried on (if ever you have been) by the full force of your genius ! Why indeed may not I too deal poetically with a poet ? This much I bargain for at once : you must send me all your first fruits as soon as you have brought them to perfection ; nay, rather, even before you have perfected them, just as they are, all fresh and unformed, and still resembling things at their birth. You will reply that what is taken * Dio Cassius relates that Decebalus, channel. Trajan diverted it a second the Dacian king, div^erted the course time and secured the treasure.

I know it. And therefore they shall be judged of by me too as things merely begun ; they shall be regarded as parts, and shall await your finishing touches in my desk. Suffer me to have this pledge, in addition to the others, of your friendship ; that I be made acquainted even with such things as you would wish none to be acquainted with. In short, it may be that I shall admire and praise your writings more highly in proportion as you are slow and cautious about sending them ; but I shall love you more highly, and praise you more highly, the greater your speed and the less your caution in doing so. (5.) To Geminus. Our friend Macrinus has received a severe blow. He has lost his wife, a model woman, even if she had lived in old times. With her he spent thirty-nine years without a quarrel and without offence. How great the respect she paid her husband, while herself worthy of respect in the highest degree ! How numerous, how lofty the virtues, which, gathered from different ages,* were assembled and united in her person. Macrinus indeed has one great solace, in that he retained so great a blessing for so long a time ; and yet, for this reason, he is all the more embittered by the loss of it. For the enjoy- ment of pleasures increases the pain of being deprived of them. I am therefore in a state of anxiety about my dear friend, till such time as he shall be able to admit of being diverted from his sorrow and allow his wound to heal. And this will be brought about by nothing so much as by necessity itself, by lapse of time, and satiety of grief. * See vi. 26, which will best exyoung man in geniality, an elder in pl.aia this, \"a boy in candour, a seriousness ;\" and again v. 16 init. BOOK VIIL 259 (6.) To MONTANUS. You must have learnt by this time from my letter how I lately remarked a monument to Pallas with this inscription on it : \" To him the Senate, on account of his faithfulness and loyalty to his patrons, decreed the PrjE- torian insignia and a sum of fifteen million sesterces. He was contented with the honour merely.* Subsequently it seemed to me worth while to hunt up the decree itself. I found it, and it was so verbose and extravagant, that the above extremely fulsome inscription seems modest and even humble by its side. Let -I will not say the African! and Achaici and Numantini of old -^but the men that are near to us, the Marii, Sullas, Pompeys (I will go no further),let these compare themselves with Pallas, and they will fall short of the praises accorded to him. Am I to suppose the men who thus decreed to have been humourists, or cravens ? I would call them humourists if such humour became a Senate. Cravens, then ? But no one is in such a craven condition that he can be forced to such acts. Was the cause, then, ambition and the yearn- ing for advancement ? But who so demented as to wish for advancement at the price of his own and the public disgrace, in a society where the advantage to be derived from the loftiest dignity should consist in being able to take the lead ineulogising Pallas in the Senate ? I pass by the circumstance that the Prsetorian insignia are offered to Pallas, though a slave, inasmuch as they are offered by slaves. I pass by their decreeing \" tliat he should not only be exhorted, but actually compelled to the use of golden rings ; \" for it was opposed to the august dignity of the Senate for a man of Prcetorian rank to wear iron ones These are trifling matters, which may be passed over. But this is noteworthy, that \"on account of Pallas the * See Book vii. Letter 29. 26o PLINY'S LETTERS. Senate \" (and the Senate-house was not purified after this !) -\" on Pallas's account tlie Senate returns thanks to Caesar, in that his highness himself has bestowed the most honorable mention on him, and has also accorded to the Senate the faculty of testifying towards him its good will.\" What indeed could be more glorious for the Senate than that it should appear sufficiently grateful to Pallas ? This is added : \" That Pallas, to whom all of them, to the best of each man's abilities, confess their obligations, may enjoy, as he so richly deserves to do, the fruits of his matchless integrity and his matchless energy.\" You would suppose that the limits of the Empire had been extended, that armies had been rescued for the State. To this is tacked on, \"Inasmuch as to the Senate and the people no more agreeable occasion for their liberality could be exhibited than the good fortune of being able to add to the means of so disinterested and faithful a guardian of the prince's revenues.\" This was at that time the aspiration of the Senate, this was the chief delight of the people, this was the most agreeable occasion for liberality: to have the good fortune to add to the means of Pallas by squandering the public revenues ! See what follows : \" That it had been the wish of the Senate, for its part, to decree to him a sfift of fifteen million sesterces out of the treasury, and the more his mind was remote from desires of this kind, the more earnestly did they pray the Father of the State to compel him to yield to the Senate.\" This, to be sure, was alone wanting : that Pallas should be dealt with by public authority ; that Pallas in person should be entreated to yield to the Senate ; that Caesar himself should be called in to plead against this arrogant self-denial, and to prevent his spurning the fifteen million sesterces. Spurn them he didthe only way in which, after the public offer to him of so vast a sum, he could show his arrogance still more than by accepting it. Yet the Senate, in a tone of complaint, praised even this act in the following words : \" But inasmuch as the most BOOK VIIL 261 excellent Prince and Father of the State, at the request of Pallas, has willed that that portion of the decree which related to the grant to him out of the treasury of fifteen million sesterces should he annulled ; the Senate hereby witnessed, that albeit it had of its own good will, and in accordance with his merits, initiated a decree of the above sum, among the other honours, to Pallas on account of his integrity and diligence ; yet, as they do not deem it lawful to set themselves against the will of their prince in. any matter, so in this matter too they submit themselves to it.\" Picture to yourself Pallas interposing his veto, as it were, on the decree of the Senate, and restricting the honours paid to himself ; refusing the fifteen millions as too much, after accepting the Prtetorian insignia as of smaller account. Picture to yourself Csssar complying with the prayers, or rather the commands, of his freed- man in presence of the Senate, for the freedman commands his patron when he is able to petition him in the Senate. Picture to yourself the Senate continually witnessing that it had initiated a decree of this sum, among the other honours, to Pallas, in accordance with his merits and its good will, and that it would have persevered in its inten- tion if it had not been for its compliance with the prince's will, which it was not lawful to set one's self against in any matter. So then, in order that Pallas should not carry off the fifteen millions from the treasury, his own modesty and the compliance of the Senate were requisite, which latter, in this particular case, would not have complied if they had thought it lawful not to comply in any matter whatever. Do you think this is the end ? Wait a bit and hear something still stronger. \"And inasmuch as it is of advantage that the gracious disposition of the prince, ever prompt to honour and reward the deserving, should be everywhere exhibited to view, and chiefly in those places where the persons charged with the administration of his affairs may be stimulated to imitation, and where the highly proved faithfulness and integrity of Pallas may by his example provoke a zeal for laudable emulation ; the message read by the most excellent prince before this most honourable house on the tenth day before the Kalends of February last past, together with the decrees passed by the Senate on these matters, shall be inscribed on brass, and the brass in question shall be affixed to the statue in armour of the late Emperor Julius.\" It did not seem enough that the Senate-house should witness such disgraceful proceedings ; a place of great resort was selected for publishing them, where contemporaries should read them, and posterity as well. It was decided that the brass should be inscribed with all the honours of this haughty slave, both those wliich he repudiated and those which (as far as those who decreed them were concerned) he had borne.* The Praetorian insignia of Pallas were cut and carved on public and enduring monuments, just for all the world like ancient treaties, just like sacred laws ! Such was thehow to name the quality I know not -of the prince, of the Senate, of Pallas himself, that they wished to have affixed before the eyes of all, Pallas his impudence, Cassar his submissiveness, the Senate its base- ness. Nor was there any shame felt in veiling this in- famy with a show of reasonan exquisite and admirable reason to be sure !that on the strenoth of the rewards o bestowed on Pallas the others might be provoked to the zeal of emulation ! So cheap were honours held, even those which Pallas did not disdain. Yet there were found persons of respectable birth who sought for and deshed what they saw given to a freedman and held out to slaves. How glad I am that I did not fall upon those times, of which I am just as much ashamed as if I had y\\ lived in them. Nor do I doubt that you will be similarly * The allusion is to the Praetorian one Avho really had discharged the insignia, which lie accepted. Prsetorship. Senate put him iu the position of BOOK VIII. impressed, for I know you have the soul of an honest man and a freeman. Hence you will he the more ready to think that, though I may have carried my indignation in certain places to a height unsuitable to a letter, yet my complaints are rather below than above the mark. To Tacitus. Not as one master to another, nor again \" as one disciple to another\" (for so you write it), but as master to a disciple for you are the master, I the opposite ; more than that, you are recalling me to school, while I am still prolonging my holidayshave you sent your book to me. Come, now, could I have produced a more topsy-turvy sentence than the above ? *by this very means proving that I am one who ought not to be called, let alone your master, even your disciple. However, I will take on me the part of master, and exercise on your book the right you have bestowed on me, and all the more freely that I am not going to send you in the meanwhile any writing of mine for you to revenge yourself upon. (8.) To EOMANUS. Have you seen, at any time, the source of the Clitum- nus ? If you have not as yetand I fancy you have not, for otherwise you would have told me of itgo and see what I (and I am ashamed of having been so slow about it) lately saw. There rises a hill of moderate size, wooded and shaded by ancient cypresses, at the base of which the spring emerges, forced out through many * Num potui longius hyperhaton sent your book,' wliicli are awkwardly facere ? but unequal channels, and after struggling tlirougli a troubled pool of its own formation, opens out to tlie view with broad expanse, clear and transparent, so that you are able to count the small coins thrown into it and the glistening pebbles. Thence it is impelled, not by the slope of the ground, but by its own very abundance, and, as it were, weight; now but a source, now already a noble river, and one actually capable of bearing ships, which, even when they come in opposite directions, and with contrary effort are holding a different course, it suffers to pass each other, and carries on their way. Such is the strength and rapidity of its current, though over a plane surface, that it is not assisted by oars, and, when it is faced, it is only with extreme difficulty that it can be overcome by oars or punt-poles. It is an agreeable change for those who are afloat for sport and pastime to vary toil by repose or repose by toil, according as they shift their course. The banks are clothed with a quantity of ashes and poplars, which the transparent river reflects in succes- sion by so many green images, just as though they were submerged in it. The coldness of the water might vie with that of snow, and its colour does not yield to that of snow. Hard by is a temple ancient and venerable. Clitumnus stands there in person, clothed and adorned with the prse- texta. Oracular responses indicate the prophetic power in addition to the presence of tlie divinity. Scattered around are a number of chapels and as many gods. Each of these has his own worship and his own name, some of them even their own springs. For besides that spring, which is, as it were, the parent of the rest, there are smaller ones, separated from the fountain-head, but never- theless flowing into the river, which is spanned by a bridge. and what is open to ordinary use. Above bridge naviga- tion only is permitted; below, one may bathe as well. The people of Hispellum, to whom the late Emperor BOOK VIII. 265 Augustus assigned this locality, furnisli baths at the public expense, and they also furnish lodgings. Nor is there a lack of villas, which, owing to the attractions of the river, stand on its borders. In short, there will be nothing there from which you may not derive pleasure ; you will even be able to study, and will read a variety of productions by a variety of people, inscribed on every column and every wall in honour of the spring and the god. Many of these you will approve of, some you will laugh atand yet, no ; you, with your usual good-nature, will laugh at none of them. (9.) To Uesus. For a long time I have taken neither book nor pen in hand. For a long time I have not known what rest is or repose, or, in short, that state, so idle yet so agreeable, of doing nothing and being nothing. To such a degree do the multitude of my friends' affairs debar me from seclu- tion and study. For no studies are of such importance that the office of friendship should be abandoned on their accountindeed, that this office should be most religiously guarded is a matter wdiicli is taught us by these very studies. (10.) To Fabatus, his Wife's Geandfather. The stronger vour desire to see great-grandchildren of yours born of us, the more you will grieve to hear that your granddaughter has had a miscarriage, while, girl- like, she did not know that she was with child, and, in consequence, omitted certain things which should be observed by women in that state, and did other things which should have been omitted. She has expiated her mistake at the expense of a great lesson, having been brought into extreme peril. Hence, while you must necessarily be grieved at your old age being deprived of descendants, who had been, so to speak, prepared for you, yet you ought, at the same time, to thank the gods who refuse you great-grandchildren for the present, in such a way as to preserve the life of your granddaughter, and who will yet bestow on you those great-grandchildren, the expectation of whom is made surer by this very fruitfulness of my wife, though, to be sure, it has been ascertained under rather unfavourable circumstances. I am now exhorting, admonishing, and confirming you by the same methods as I employ towards myself. Nor, indeed, can great-grandchildren be desired by you more ardently than are children by me, children to whom I think myself des- tined to bequeath, on your side and on my own, an easy road to honours, names widely known, and family images which will endure. May they only be born, and turn this sorrow of ours into joy ! (II.) To HiSPULLA. When I think of your affection for your brother's daughter, surpassing in tenderness even the indulgence of a mother, I feel that I ought to begin by announcing what ought to come later, in order that joy may take first possession of you and so leave no room for anxiety. And yet I am apprehensive that, even after rejoicing, you will return to your fears ; that, while delighted at Calpurnia's being freed from peril, you will shudder at the same time at her having been imperilled. She is cheerful noiv, and restored to herself and to me ; she begins to regain strength, and by her progress towards recovery to measure the crisis she has passed through. She was, in fact,* in the most critical condition (this be said without evil I BOOK VIIL 267 omen !), through no personal fault, rather through some fault due to her age. Hence her miscarriage, and the sad proofs of an unsuspected pregnancy. Accordingly, though it has not been your good fortune to assuage your regret for your lost brother by means of a grandson or grand- daughter of his, yet remember that is a blessing which is delayed rather than denied, since she is safe from whom we may hope for it. At the same time excuse to your father a mishap which women are always more prepared to look on with indulgence. (12.) To MiNICIANUS. I must beg to be excused for just this one day. Titinius Capito is going to recite, and I hardly know whether it be more my duty or my desire to hear him. He is an excellent man, and one to be numbered among the special illus- trations of our age; he cultivates literature, and loves, cherishes, and advances men of letters ; he is the port, the harbour, the place of refuge for a number of those who do anything in the way of composition ; an example to all ; lastly, a restorer and reformer of letters, which are now in their decline. He lends his house to people who recite, and frequents audiencesand that not merely at his own abodewith rare good-nature ; me certainly, provided he is in town, he has never failed. Besides, the nobler the incentive to gratitude, the more shabby it would be not to show one's self grateful. Pray, if I were harassed by legal proceedings, should I consider myself bound to one who appeared to my recognisances ; and now, because all my business, all my care is with literature, shall I be less obliged to one who frequents me with so much assiduity, in a matter which, if not the only one, is certainly the most important one which can lay me under an obligation ? Yet, if I owed him no return, no mutual good office, so to speak, yet I should be attracted either by the genius of the man, wliicli is so admirable, so grand, so gentle even when most serious, or else by the noble character of his theme. He is writing of the deaths of illustrious men, and among them of some who were very dear to me. I seem, then, to be discharging an office of piety when, in the case of those whose obsequies I could not attend, I am present at what may be termed their funeral eulogies, which, though late in time, are on that account all the more truthful. (I3-) To Genialis. I approve of your having read my little books in com- pany with your father. It pertains to your advancement to learn from a man of the highest eloquence what deserves praise and what censure, and, at the same time, to be so trained as to learn to speak the truth. You see whom you ought to follow, in whose footsteps you ought to tread. Happy fellow ! who have had the luck in one and the same person to meet with a model so excellent and so nearly related to you ; * who, in short, have liim to imitate, above all others, whom nature willed that you should most resemble. (14.) To Apjsto. As you are so deeply versed in civil and constitutional law -f-(of which senatorial law forms a part), I desire to * Cui contiriit unum atque idem opti-Jus privatum may be rendered by mum et covjunctissimum exemplar. \" the laws relating to the transac- Keil has vivum atque idem, &c.

These Orations, vol. i. terms cannot be exactly rendered. BOOK VIIL 269 learn from you particularly whether I did or did not make a mistake in the Senate on a recent occasion, that I may be instructed, not with a view to the past (for it would be too late for that), but to the future, should any- thing of a like kind present itself. You will say, \" Wliy inquire about what you ought to know ? \" Because the slavery of past times has introduced a certain oblivion and ignorance, as well of all other ex- cellent sciences, so also of senatorial law. For few have the patience to be willing to learn what they will never have to practise. Add to this, that it is difficult to retain what you Tiarn learnt unless you do practise it. Thus it happened that the restoration of liberty surprised us in an untrained and inexperienced condition, and, enflamed by her charms, we are obliged to do certain things before we are masters of them. On the other hand, it was the ancient usage that we should learn from our elders, not only through our ears, but through our eyes as well, what we ourselves should presently have to do, and, by a kind of succession, to hand down to our juniors. Hence strip- lings were forthwith inured to service in the camps, that they might be habituated to command by obedience, and to act the part of leaders while learning to follow. Hence such as were to be candidates for public offices stationed themselves by the doors of the Senate-house, and were spectators of the national council before becoming members of it. Each had his own father for an instructor, or to him who had no father the oldest and most illustrious citizens stood in the place of one. What are the privileges of those who introduce motions, what the rights of those who pronounce on them, what the power of the magistrates, and the liberty accorded to the remaining Senators, where to yield and where to resist, what is the time for silence and what the limit of speech, how to distinguish between the parts of a conflicting proposition, how those who would add anything to a previous proposal may execute their purpose ; in short, the whole practice of the Senate was taught by example, the surest mode of instruction. Yet we, when youths, were, to be sure, in the camps. Yes, but at a time when prowess was suspected and inactivity was prized ; when the leaders were without authority and the soldiers without shame ; when the supreme control was nowhere and obedience nowhere ; when all things were in a state of solution and confusion, and even inversion ; in short, of a character to be forgotten rather than remembered. We also had a view of the Senate, but a cowering and speechless Senate, at a time when it was dangerous to speak according to one's wishes and vile to speak against them. What could be learnt at such a period ? and what could be the advantage of learning ? when the Senate was summoned either to fall into a profound sleep or to sanc- tion some atrocious villany, and, detained now for the purpose of exciting laughter, now for that of inflicting pain, pronounced decisions which were never serious, though oftentimes sad. These same evils we witnessed and endured for many years after we had ourselves become senators and sharers in them, by which means our intellects were •permanently dulled, broken, and bruised. It is but a short time (every time is short in proportion as it is happy) since we have learnt with pleasure what we are, and can practise with pleasure what we know. And this gives me a greater right to ask, first, that you will pardon my mistake, if there be a mistake ; next, that you would apply to it your remedial learning, whose care it has always been to investigate con- stitutional in the same way as civil law, what is ancient in the same way as what is modern, what is rare equally with what is common. And indeed I am of opinion that the kind of point which I am submitting to you was either not very familiar, or else actually unknown in practice to those predecessors of ours whose constant and varied experience left them in ignorance of scarce anything. Hence, not only shall I be the more readily excused if I have chanced BOOK VIII. 27 I to trip, but you will be the more entitled to credit if you can instruct me on a point which it is uncertain to me whether you have studied. The debate was about the freedmen of Afranius Dexter, the Consul, who had perished either by his own or his servants' hands, either through their crime or their obedience to liis commands, it is uncertain which. As to these persons, one senator (\" Who ? \" you ask. It was I ; but this is of no consequence) opined that, having been put to the question, they should be exempted from punishment ; a second, that they should be banished to an island ; a third, that they should suffer death. So great was the difference between these proposals, that they could only be taken singly. For what is there in common be- tween putting to death and banishing ? ISTothing more, by Hercules, than between banishing and acquitting. Though, to be sure, a proposal for acquitting is somewhat nearer to one for banishing than w^ould be a proposal for putting to death, since both the former leave life untouched, while the last takes it away. Yet, meanwhile, those who were for the punishment of death and those who were for banishment sat together, and by a temporary simulation deferred the discord which underlay their concord. I demanded that the proper number of these three proposi- tions should be established, and that two of them should not be joined together in a short truce. Hence I insisted that those who were for the infliction of the capital penalty should leave the side of those who were for banishment, and that those who were shortly about to differ among them- selves should not in the interim be united in opposition to the party who were for an acquittal ; because it was of very little consequence that they disagreed with the same proposal, seeing that they had previously agreed to diffe- rent ones. This too seemed to me particularly strange, that while he who had pronounced for banishing the freedmen and inflicting the last penalty on the slaves had been compelled to divide his vote, yet he who was for punishing the freedmen with death should be told off amoncr those who were for banishins^t hem. For if it had been right that the proposition of one should be divided, as comprehending two different things, I could not dis- cover in what way the propositions could be joined to- gether of two persons who pronounced themselves so differently. And indeed permit mein your hearing precisely as there, and though the question is settled pre- cisely as though it were still aliveto give you the rea- sons for my opinion, and to put together now at my ease what I then threw out disjointedly amidst many stormy interruptions. Let us suppose three judges in all to have been assigned to this cause, and that the decision of one of these had been that the freedmen should die ; of the second, that they should be banished ; of the third, that they should be acquitted. Pray, should two of these opinions, by their united strength, destroy the last ? Or, taken separately, should not each of them be worth just what the other is, so that the first can no more be connected with the second than the second with the third ? It results that, in the Senate as well, votes ought to be reckoned as being opposed to each other, which are given as being different from each other. What if one and the same man were to pronounce for death and banishment ? would it be possible for these persons both to die and to be banished in accordance with this single vote ? Indeed, could that be considered one vote at all which conjoined things so diverse ? How, then, when one pronounces for punishing them with death, and another for banishing them, can that appear to be one vote because it is pronounced by two, wliich would not appear one vote if it were pronounced by one ? What ! does not the law clearly teach that the votes for death and those for banishment should be separated, when it orders divisions to be taken in this manner : -\" Those who are of this opinion to this side; those who are of any other opinion* to the side wliicli accords witli your opinion.\" Examine tliese words singly and weigh tliem. \" Those who are of this opinion,\" that is to say, who think the men should be banished, \" to this side \"that is to say, to the side on which the senator who has made the motion for banishment is sitting. From this it is clear that tliose who are in favour of putting them to death cannot remain on the same side. \" Those who are of any other opinion.\" You observe that the law, not content with saying \" other,\" has added to it \" any.\" Can there be a doubt, then, that those who put to death hold an entirely different opinion from those who banish ? \" To that side which accords with your opinion.\" Does not the law itself seem to call, to compel, to drive, those who differ to the opposite side ? Does not the Consul, even, point out to every one, and that not merely in the customary form of words, but with his hand and by his gestures, the place where he is to remain or to which he is to pass over ? \" But it will happen that if the votes for death and those for banishment be divided, the vote in favour of acquittal may prevail,\" What does this matter to the persons voting ? It certainly does not become them to strive by every art and every calculation to prevent a more merciful decision from being carried. \" It is proper, in any case, that those who are for the death penalty and those who are for banishment should first be compared with those who acquit, and afterwards with each other. As, for example, at certain of the shows, some individual is separated and reserved by lot to compete with the victor, so in the Senate there are certain first and second trials of strength, and the one of two proposals which comes out victorious is waited on by a third.\" l^eed I say that if the first proposal be carried the remaining ones are put an end to ? How, then, can propositions be * Qui alia omnia sentitis was really takes it here in the way most suitable a euphemism for \" You who are of a for his ai'gument. contrary opinion.\" Pliuy, however, S joined on a common ground* for which no place can be found subsequently ? To repeat this more clearly, when the motion for banishment is made, if those who are for death do not at once go to the other side, it will be in vain that they will differ at a subsequent stage from those with whom they have voted just before. t But why do I seem to be teaching when I want to learn whether these motions should have been divided, whether they should have been gone into singly ? To be sure I obtained what I demanded ; none the less, however, do I ask whether I ought to have made the demand. In what way was it obtained ? Why, the senator who had moved that the extreme penalty should be inflicted (overpowered, I do not know whether by the legality, but certainly by the equity of my demand), threw up his own motion, and went over to the side of him who was for banishment : fearing, no doubt, that if the motions were taken separ- atelyand, but for his action, it seemed likely that they would bethe one for acquittal would obtain a majority. And, indeed, there were many more of that one party than in either of the other two taken singly. Then those senators, too, who were led by his authority, thus left to themselves after he had gone over, abandoned a proposal which had been forsaken by its own author, and followed in his species of desertion the person whom they followed in his lead. So out of three proposals two resulted, and of these two one prevailed, tlie third being extinguished, which, as it could not overcome the two others, had to choose by which of the two it would be defeated. | * Unus atque idem locus.

I am prostrated by the ailments of my servants, by deaths among them, too, and of young ones into the bargain. I have two consolations, by no means on a par with the greatness of my sorrow, still consolations. One ia my readiness in setting them free (for I do not seem to have lost quite prematurely such as had already gained their freedom when I lost them) ; the other is, that I permit even my slaves to make quasi-testamentary dis- positions, observing these just as though they were legal documents. They enjoin and request whatever they choose, and I obey as if under orders. They distribute, determine !

Tor to slaves the household is a kind of state, and stands in the place of a community. Still, though soothed by these consolations, I am dis- pirited and broken by reason of the identical humanity of disposition which has prompted me to these same conces- sions. Yet I would not on that account be made harder, while not ignoring that others style mishaps of this sort a pecuniary loss and nothing more, and hence seem to themselves great and wise men. As for these, whether they be great and wise, I cannot tell ; men they are not. For it is the part of a man to be affected by grief, to feel, yet at the same time to bear up and to admit of consolation, not to be in no need of consolation. However, about all this I have said more perhaps than I ought, yet less than I wished. There is, indeed, a certain pleasure even in grief, particularly if you weep into the bosom of a friend who is prepared to bestow on your tears either his approval or his pardon. (Anon, n.d.) To Macrinus. Is the weather as rough and unsettled with you as it is with us ? Here we have constant storms and a succession of inundations. The Tiber has exceeded its channels, and is flowing hicrh over its less elevated banks. Though its force is weakened by an outlet which the Emperor, in his great forethought, has constructed, yet it covers the valleys and pours over the fields, and where the surface is flat it presents itself to the eye in the place of the surface. Hence it forces backwards, as thouo;h it went to meet them, the streams which it usually receives and carries down in combination, and by this means covers, with waters not its own, a country which it does not itself touch. The Anio, most charming of rivers, and which on that account had seemed as it were to be invited by and BOOK VIII. 277 made to slacken its course near the villas on its banks * lias destroyed and carried off in great part the woods that overshadowed it. It has undermined hills, and, impeded in many places by the mass of falling debris, while seeking its lost way, it has thrown down houses, and risen and swept over their ruins. Those who on loftier ground were not caught by the tempest in question beheld in one place the appliances of wealth and costly furniture ; in another, agricultural implements ; here, cattle, ploughs, herdsmen; there, the loose herds left to themselves, and among these objects the trunks of trees, or the rafters and roofs of villas, all drifting in wide variety. ISTor, indeed, have even those localities to which the river did not ascend been exempted from damage. For, in lieu of the river, there was a continuous downpour, and whirlwinds were precipitated from the clouds, the fences surrounding valuable enclosures were overthrown, public monuments were shaken and even toppled down. Many persons were disabled and overwhelmed and crushed by accidents of this description, and loss of property has been aggravated by mourning. I am apprehensive that something of the same kind in a proportionate degree may have imperilled you where you are : and I beg you, if there has been nothing of the sort, to have regard to my anxiety with all possible speed. But, if there e'en has been, announce that, just the same. For the difference is but trifling between suffering mis- fortunes and anticipating them ; except, however, that there is a limit to grief, while there is no limit to fear. Our grief is indeed proportioned to what we know to have happened : our fears to what may happen. * Another, and perhaps a better, beauty of the villas. In the renderway of taking this is \"The Anio, ing in the text, the villas are attracted most voluptuous (delicatissimus) of by the beauty of the Anio, and invite rivers, and which on that account it.

In fact, he was crippled and powerless in all his limbs, and could enjoy his vast wealth with his eyes alone : nor could he move on his couch even, save by the help of others. Moreover (indelicate as well as pitiable to relate) he had his teeth washed and brushed for him. He was often heard to say himself, when com- plaining of the miseries forced on him by his infirmities, that he \" daily licked the fingers of his slaves.\" Yet he lived on, and desired to live, kept up principally by his wife, who, by her steadfastness, had turned her fault in entering on such a marriage into a source of glory. You have now all the talk of the town, for TuUus con- stitutes all the talk. The sale of his effects is looked for. Such indeed were his stores, that he has adorned the most extensive gardens, on the same day that he bought them, with statues in great profusion and of great antiquity; he had as many works of the highest art lying neglected in storerooms. In your turn, if there be anything in your parts worth a letter, don't think it a trouble to write. For not only are men's ears gladdened by news, but also we are instructed by examples to regulate our lives. (19.) To Maximus. My delight and my solace is in literary pursuits. There is nothing so joyful that it is not made more joyful, nothing so sad that it is not made less sad, through their means. Hence, when disordered by the sickness of my wife and the critical condition of my servantsindeed, by the deaths of some of them -I fled for refuge to mv one comfort in sorrowmy studies. These furnish me with a keener sense of misfortunes, but at the same time with the power of bearing them more patiently. Now, it is my habit, when proposing to give anything to the public, to test it previously by the help of my friends' judgment, and BOOK VIIL 28 1 above all of yours. Accordingly, now, if ever, apply your- self to the book which you will receive with this letter ; for I fear that / in my sorrowful condition have not sufficiently applied myself to it. I was indeed able to command my grief so far as to write, but not so as to write with a dis- engaged and cheerful mind. Now, as joy is the profit derived from letters, so do letters in their turn derive a profit from cheerfulness. (20.) To Gallus. Objects such as we are in the habit of undertaking journeys and traversing the sea to make acquaintance with, we neglect when they are situated under our eyes ; whether it has been so provided by nature, that, while careless of what is close to us, we run after what is distant, or because the desire for all objects languishes where the opportunity is easy ; or else that we defer, as being sure to see them often, sights which it is given us to enjoy whenever we choose. Whatever be the reason, there are a quantity of things in our city, and the neighbourhood of the city, which we do not even know by hearsay, let alone eyesight. Yet if Achaia, Egypt, Asia, had produced these, or any other land fruitful in marvels, and giving them repute too, we should have heard all about, and read all about and explored them. What, at any rate, I had never heard of or seen, I for my part lately heard of and saw at the same time. My wife's grandfather had pressed me to make an in- spection of his estate near Ameria. As I was going over it, a lake lying under us was pointed out to me, named Vadimon ; at the same time some incredible circumstances connected wiih it were related. I reached the lake itself. It is rounded into the shape of a horizontal wheel, regular on all sides, without a bay or obliquity of any kind ; ^verytliing is measured to scale and even, as tliougli hollowed and cut out by the hand of an artist. The colour of the water is lighter than dark blue but deeper than bluish green.* It has an odour and a taste of sulphur, and the healing property of mending broken articles.f Its size is small, yet such that it can feel the winds and swell into waves. There is no ship on it (for it is sacred), but floating on it are islands, all of them grassy with reeds and rushes, and other herbage which the swampy soil in its productiveness, or the banks of tlie lake them- selves, bring forth. Each of them has its individual shape and dimensions, but all have their outer edges worn, in consequence of frequently striking either against the shore or against each other, and so rubbing and getting rubbed. All of them are of a like elevation and buoyancy, since their roots descend but a little way below the surface, after the fashion of a ship's keel. These roots can be seen on every side, suspended and at the same time submerged in the water. Occasionally these islands are joined and coupled together, resembling a continent ; occasionally they are dispersed by discordant winds ; not unfrequently, left to themselves, they float in single tranquillity. Often the smaller ones hang on to the lar^rer, like little boats on to ships of burden ; often larger and smaller ones take to a trial, as it were, of each other's speed ; then, again, all of them, driven upon the same part of the shore, form, where they have stopped, a promontory, and, sometimes here, sometimes there, conceal or restore to view portions of the lake. It is only when they are in the middle that they do not contract its circumference. It is certain that cattle in pursuit of herbage are in the habit of advancing into these islands, fancying them the edge of the lake, and do not perceive that the soil is moveable till reft from the * Viridi pressior.

BOOK VIII. 2S3 shoreput on board and shipped, so to speakthey see with affright the lake all round them : presently going ashore wherever the wind has carried them, they no more know that they have disembarked than they knew that they had embarked. This same lake discharges itself into a river, which, after presenting itself to the eyes for a short time, loses itself underground, and flows on out of sight. If anything has been thrown into it before its disappearance it will preserve and reproduce the object. All this I have written to you, believing that it would be no less new and no less agreeable to you than it was to me. For as with me, so with you, too, nothing is so delight- ful as the works of nature. (21.) To Aerianus. Just as in life, so in literature, I deem it the most excellent course, and the one most in accord with human nature, to mingle the grave with the gay, lest the former should degenerate into morbidness and the latter into sauciness. Led by this consideration, I vary my more serious works with sportive and jocular effusions. For the production in public of these latter, I chose the most fitting time as well as place, andthat they might with- out delay grow accustomed to a hearing from persons with nothing else to do, and at the dinner-tablein the month of July (when, for the most part, there is an interval of rest from the lawsuits), I arranged my friends with seats furnished with desks in front of the dining-couches. It so chanced that, on the morning of that day, I was unexpectedly called to assist a friend in court, and this furnished me with a ground for making some prefatory remarks. For I entreated that no one would charge me with want of respect for the work in hand, because, when intending to recite (even though only to friends, and to a small audience, which means to friends again), I had not refrained from the courts and from business. I added that, even in the matter of my writings, I followed this order of preferring duty to pleasure, the serious to the agreeable, and of writing for my friends first, for myself afterwards. My book was composed of various little pieces, in various metres ; for thus it is that we who have not much confidence in our genius are wont to avoid the risk of surfeiting people. I recited two days. The approval of my audience exacted this of me ; and yet, though other readers skip certain parts, and take credit for skipping them, I pass over nothing, and even aver to my audiences that I pass over nothing. Indeed, I read the whole that I may correct the whole; and this cannot be the case with those who recite extracts. But, you will say that the latter course is more modest, and perhaps more respectful. Yes ; but the former is the more straightforward and the more friendly. For he is friendly who thinks the friend- ship felt for him to be such that he is not in dread of being wearisome. Otherwise, what is the use of intimates if they only come together for the sake of their own amusement ? He is a mere fop, and resembles a stranger, who would rather hear his friend's good book than make it a good one. I do not doubt that, in accordance with your usual affection for me, you will desire to read, as soon as possible, this newly compounded book. You shall read it, but in a revised form, for this was the object of my recitation. Yet you are already acquainted with many parts of it. These, subsequently either improved, orwhich occasionally happens through long delayaltered for the worse, you will discover again, in a new form as it were, and rewritten. For where many changes have been made, even what is left seems to have undergone a change likewise. BOOK VIII. To Geminus. You know tliem, don't you, those men who, slaves to every evil passion, are as indignant at the vices of others as though they envied them, and who are for punishing most severely the persons whom they imitate most closely ; whereas, even to those who need no one's indulgence, nothing is more becoming than leniency. More than this, I esteem him the most excellent and the most faultless who so forgives others as though he himself sinned daily, and so abstains from sins as though he forgave no one. Accordingly let us hold to this, in private, in public, in every relation of life; to be implacable to ourselves and easy of entreaty even to those who are unable to make allowances for any but themselves. Let us commit to memory what one of the mildest, and, on that account, among others, one of the greatest of men, Thrasea, used frequently to say \" He who hates vices hates mankind.\" You will perhaps ask what has moved me to write thus. A certain person recentlybut it will be better to tell you when we meet ; and yet, on second thoughts, not even then. For I fear that by inveighing against and censuring and recapitulating what I disapprove, I may be violating the very precepts which I am giving at this moment. Let the man, whoever and whatever he is, be nameless ; by making him known, example would profit nothing ; by leaving him unknown, good-nature will profit much. (Anon, n.d.) To Marcellinus. All literary pursuits, all serious occupations, all amusements, have been banished, driven out, rooted from my mind by the poignant grief which the death of Julius Avitus has caused me. It was at my house that he put on the Latus Claims* I assisted him with my support when he was a candidate for office ; add to this, that he so loved and revered me that he treated me as the moulder of his characteras his master, so to speak. A rare thing this in the case of our young men. For how few of them will yield, as being inferior, either to the age or the authority of another ? They are all at once wise ; they all at once know everything ; they revere no one ; they imitate no one, and are indeed themselves their own models. Not so Avitus, whose chief wisdom was in esteeming others wiser than himself, whose chief erudition was in his desire to learn. He was always seeking some advice, either on the subject of his studies or the duties of life, and he always went away with a sense of being made better. And so he was, either from what he had heard, or at any rate from having inquired. What deference he paid to that most accomplished man Servianus, when the latter was Legate and he was military tribune. He so appreciated and at the same time captivated Servianus that in his march across from Germania to Pannonia he followed him, not as being one of his army, but as a companion and personal attendant. Such was his industry, such his unassuming character, than in his capacity of Quaestor he was no less pleasant and agreeable than useful to his Consuls, of whom he served several. How active, how indefatigable he was in his pursuit of this very office of ^dile, from the enjoyment of which he has been prematurely snatched away ! And this it is which greatly aggravates my grief. There present themselves to my eyes his vain labours and fruitless applications, and the honour which he succeeded in deserving only. There returns to my mind that Latus Clavus assumed in my house ; those first, those last efforts of mine on his behalf; the discourses, the consultations which we held together. I am touched by his own * See Book ii. Letter 9. It was assumed in some cases, with the toga virilis. He had a mother of great age, a wife whom he had married in her maidenliood a year before, a daughter not long born to him.* So many hopes, so many joys did a single day turn to mourning ! Just nominated ^Edile, a new-made husband, a new-made father, he has left behind him a dignity never assumed, a childless mother, a widowed wife, an infant daughter who never knew her father. My sorrow is augmented by the fact that it was during my absence from him, and when I was unprepared for the impending misfortune, that I learnt at one and the same time his illness and his decease. Such is my anguish while writing on this subject, and on this subject alone. For indeed just now I can neither think nor speak of any- thin<T else. o (24.) To Maximus.

Eespect the gods, their founders, and the names of their gods. Eespect their ancient glory, and their very age * Quam paulo ante sustiderat, liter-Roman custom of laying the child at ally, \" whom he had recently taken up the father's feet. from the ground,\" in allusion to the i 288 PLINY'S LETTERS. itself, venerable in the case of men, sacred in the case of cities. Let their antiquity, their great deeds, their fables even, find honour with you. Rifle nothing from any man's dignity or liberty, or even vainglory. Keep before your eyes that this is the land which sent us our legislation, which gave laws, not to the conquered, but to those who asked for them ; * that this is Athens to which you go ; that this is Lacedsemon which you govern: that to rob these of the shadow still left them, and relics of their liberty, would be harsh, cruel, and barbarous. You see that doctorsalthough in sickness there is no difference between slave and freeyet treat freemen with greater tenderness and consideration. [Bear in mind what each community has been, not (with the view of despising it) wliat it has ceased to be. Far from you be all arrogance and asperity. Do not be afraid of contempt. Can he be contemned who holds the supreme power and the fasces, unless he be a mean, paltry creature, who begins by con- temning himself. Power tries its strength ill by injuring others ; veneration is ill acquired by terror ;3nd love is far more efficacious for obtaining one's ends than fear. For, fear vanishes when you have taken your departure, love remains ; and as the former turns to hatred, so does the latter to reverence. You, for your part, ought assuredly again and again (for I will repeat myself) to call to mind the title of your office, and to interpret for your own self what and how great a matter it is \"to order the status of free communities.\" Tor what can be more to the interest of the citizens than order of goverrunent ? Or what more precious than freedom ? Again, what a disgrace if order be exchanged for anarchy and freedom for servitude !

Hence you must the more earnestly strive that you be not reputed to have acted with greater courtesy, integrity, and judgment in a distant province than in a nearer one ; among those who are our subjects than among freemen ; when despatched by lot than when despatched by the result of deliberate choice ; when inex- perienced and unknown than when tried and approved ; since, as you have often heard and read, it is, in a general way, more disgraceful to lose reputation than not to acquire it. I beg you to believe (as was said at the beginning) that I have written all this by way of reminder and not of instruction. And yet, after all, by way of instruction too. I am not afraid, forsooth, of having exceeded the limits of affection ; nor, seeing that affection should be so strong, is there any danger of its being excessive. ( 290 ) BOOK IX. To Maximus.

Let your reputation for intrepidity be intact. And so it will be, if it be known to friends and foes that it was not merely after your enemy's death that the courage to write was born in you, but that you were quite ready for publication and were only forestalled by his death. At the same time you will avoid the reproach \" Unjust are all the insults o'er the dead.\" * For that which has been written and read aloud on the subject of a living person, if published, even after his decease, is published, as it were, against a person still living, provided this be done at once. Consequently, if you have anything else in hand, lay it aside for the time. Put the finishing touch to this work, which to me, who have read it formerly, seems long since complete ; however, let it now seem so to you too, since not only does the matter * Homer, Odyssey xxii. 412. BOOK IX. 291 itself require no delay on your part, but a consideration of the particular juncture should cut all delay short. (2.) To Sabinus. You are very obliging in pressing me not only for fre- quent letters, but for very long ones into the bargain. I have been somewhat chary in this matter, partly from a regard for your avocations, partly from my having been myself much engrossed by matters, in general of small interest, which, however, at the same time distract and weary the attention. Besides, I had no materials for writing more. Nor, indeed, is my situation the same as that of M. Tullius, whose example you invite me to f oUow. For not merely was he gifted with a most prolific genius, but events in great variety and of great importance supplied that genius with abundant material. How narrow are the limits in which / am enclosed, you well know, without my telling you, unless haply I should wish to send you letters of the school-exercise kind, and from the shade of the closet, if I may so express it. But nothing, to my mind, could be less apposite, when I think of your arms, your camps, in fine, your horns and trumpets and sweat and dust and burning suns. You are now furnished, as I think, with a reasonable excuse, and yet I am not sure that I should wish it to be approved by you. For it is a sign of the highest affection to refuse to make allowance for the shortness of one's friends' letters, even although one may know that it can be satisfactorily accounted for. (3-) To Paulinus. Different men have different ideas on the subject, but I for my part deem that individual the most fortunate who enjoys to the full the foretaste of a noble and enduring fame,, and, assured of posthumous reputation,* lives in the company of his future glory. And, for me indeed, if the prize of immortality were not before my eyes, the usual snug and sound repose would be my choice. For I suppose it is the duty of all men to think of themselves as either immortal or mortal; in the former case, certainly, to contend and to exert themselves ; in the latter, to keep quiet, to repose themselves, and not to fatigue their short existence by fleeting efforts ; as I see many do, who, by a wretched and at the same time thankless appearance of activity, only attain in the end to a contempt for themselves. All this, which I say daily to myself, I now say to you, that I may leave off saying it to myself, if you dissent ; though to be sure you, in your character of one who is always meditating some great and immortal work, will not dissent. (4.) To Mackinus. I should be afraid you would think the oration, which you will receive with this letter, of immoderate length, if it were not of such a kind as to seem to have many be- ginnings and many endings. For under each separate charge is contained as it were a separate cause. So, at whatever point you begin, or at whatever place you leave off, you will be able to read what next follows both in the light of a new commencement and a connected sequel, and so to pronounce me, if extremely long as to the whole, yet extremely short as to the separate parts. * Certus posterifatis, \"With his this sense of \" determined on ; \" but purpose set on posthumous fame.\"the rendering in the text is^simpler, Prichard and Bernard's \"Selected and, I think, better. Letters of Pliny.\" Certus often has BOOK IX. (5-) To TiKO. You are acting admirably (I have been enquiring about you, as you see), and pray persevere, in commending your love of justice to the provincials by much kindly considera- tion ; the chief part of which consists in surrounding with your regard all the most respectable citizens, and being so loved by the smaller folk that you may at the same time be approved by the leading people. For many, while they are apprehensive of seeming to give in too much to the interest of the powerful, obtain a reputation for ill-breed- ing, and even for ill-nature. Of this fault you have kept yourself well clear; I know it. Nevertheless I cannot refrain from bestowing praise on you, under the guise of advice, for maintaining a due mean, so as to preserve the distinctions of ranks and dignities; for, if these are confounded, disordered, and intermingled, nothing can be more unequal than this very equality. (6.) To Calvisius. I have been passing all this time between my writing- tablets and my books in the most delicious calm. \" How- ever,\" you ask, \" have you been able to do this in town ? \" The Circensian games were on,a species of exhibition which does not attract me even in the faintest degree. There is no novelty, no variety about them, nothing which one is not satisfied with having seen once only. This makes me all the more astonished that so many thousands of persons should have such a childish desire to see, over and over again, horses running, and men standing in chariots. If, at least, they were attracted by the speed of the horses or the skill of the men, there would be some reason in the thing. As it is, it is a bit of cloth that they applaud, a bit of cloth that they love, and if during the race itself and in the very heat of the contest such and such colours were to change wearers, the favour and applause of the public would change over with them, and the very drivers, the very horses whom they know from afar and whose names they shout out, would all at once be deserted. Such is the influence, such the importance, of a con- temptible jacket ! I say nothing of the vulgar, itself more contemptible than the jacket; but such is the case with certain persons of standing. When I remember that these can settle down so insatiably to what is so inane, insipid, and tedious, I take some pleasure in the fact that I am not taken by this pleasure.* So, I employ in litera- ture my idle hours, throughout these days which others waste in the idlest of occupations. ( 70To EOilANUS. You write that you are engaged in building. 'Tis well. I have found my defence; for I build with reason the moment that I do so in your company. Indeed there is this further resemblance between us, that you are building by the sea-side, and I by the Larian Lake. There are several villas of mine on the shore of this lake, but two of them, while they greatly delight me, exercise me in an equal degree. One of them, placed on the rocks, after the fashion of Baise, overlooks the lake ; another, similarly after the fashion of Baiae, is at the edge of the lake. Hence I am in the habit of calling the former \" Tragedy,\" and the latter \" Comedy,\" because one is supported as it were by a high buskin, and the other by a low sock.-f-Each of them has its special charm, which their very diversity renders more agreeable to the possessor of both. One enjoys a nearer, the other a more extended view of the lake ; one, with a gentle curve, embraces a small bay, the other, situated on a lofty crag, separates two small bays from each other ; there a promenade stretches for a long way, in a straight line, along the shore, here it gently curves in the sha,pe of a spacious terrace-walk ; one of them does not feel the waves, and the other breaks them. From the former you can look down on the people fishing, from the latter you can fish yourself, and throw your line * from your room, and actually from your sofa almost, just as from a skiff. These are my reasons for adding to each what is wanting, in view of the superabundant advantages already enjoyed by both. But why enter into reasons with you ? It will stand for a good reason with you that you are doing the same thing. (8.) To AUGUPJNUS. If, after you have praised me, I shall begin to praise you, I am apprehensive of seeming to be repaying a favour rather than profiering a judgment. Yet, though it should seem so, I esteem all your writings to be admirable ; chiefly, however, those which are about me. This happens owing to one and the same cause ; for not only do you write exceedingly well on the subject of your friends, but I too, as I read, find what is written on the subject of myself exceedingly good. (9.) To Colon us. I particularly applaud you for being so grievously affected by the death of Pomponius Quintianus, that you prolong your regard for the lost one by means of your regrets ; not like so many who care only for the living, or * Literally, \" your hook.\" rather pretend to care for them, and indeed do not even pretend, except in the case of those whom they see to be prosperous. For they forget the unfortunate, no less than if they were dead. But your faithfulness is unfailing, and your constancy in love such that it can be ended only by your death. And, by Hercules, Quintianus was a man who ought to be cherished on the strength of his own example. He loved the successful,* defended the wretched, mourned for the lost. What nobility in his mien to start with ! What deliberation in his speech ! How evenly balanced his severity and his playfulness ! What his love for letters ! What his judgment ! How dutifully did he live with a father most unlike himself ! How the fact of his being the best of sons was no hindrance to his seeming the best of men ! f But why do I aggravate your grief ? Yet you so loved the young man that you would rather have this, than that silence should be kept about him, particularly by me, by whose commendation you think that his life may be illustrated, his memory prolonged, and that very youth, from which he has been snatched, restored to him. J (10.) To Tacitus. I am desirous of obeying your precepts, yet such is the scarcity of wild boars that Minerva and Diana (who, according to you, should be worshipped in company) can- cannot be brought together. So Minerva alone must be served ; gingerly, however, in a manner suitable to retirement and the summer-time. On my road I worked out a * Or, prosperous : in English, as him, as in duty bound, yet without well as in Latin, this sounds like an being suspected of sharing in his vices, ambiguous compliment ; but the J The sense is obscure.

I have made some additions to them at my country house, as I did not choose to write anything else. Hence my poetrywhich you think can be most suitably turned out among groves and woodsis dormant. I have retouched one and another of my small orations. Yet this kind of work is ungrateful and dis- pleasing, and resembles rather the labours than the plea- sures of the country. (II.) To Geminus. I have received yours, which has been most agreeable to me, and especially so from your wishing something to be addressed to you such as might be inserted in the Books of Letters.* Material for this will turn up ; either precisely that which you indicate, or in preference some- thing else; for in the case of the former there are several objections. Cast your eyes round, and they wiU occur to you. I did not think there were booksellers at Lyons, and was all the more pleased to learu from your letter that my works have a ready sale there. I am rejoiced that such favour as they have acquired in town, continues to attend them abroad. Indeed, I begin to think that my productions must be tolerably finished, when, in regions so diverse, the judgments of men so widely separated from each other are yet in harmony about them. * Libris. Some books of Pliny's had asked Pliny to write him a Letters had, it appears, already been letter such as might be published published. Geminus, wishing his in a future volume, name to appear in the collection, (Anon, n.d.) To JUNIOK. A certain person was chiding his son for being somewhat too extravagant in his purchases of horses and dogs. Said I to him, when the young man had left us, \" Harkee ! \" have you never done what might have been rebuked by your father ? Have done, do I say ? Do you not sometimes do that which your son, if he were suddenly turned into your father and you into his son, might reprehend with the like severity ? Are not all men led by some error or other ? Does not one man indulge himself in one respect, and another in another ? \" Admonished by this example of excessive severity, I have, in accordance with our mutual affection, thus written to you, lest you too should at any time treat your son too sharply and rudely. Reflect, not only that he is a boy, but that you have been one, and so use this your position of father as to remember that you are both a man and the father of a man. (I3-) To QUADRATUS. In proportion to the interest and attention with which you have read the books composed by me, on the subject of the vindication of Helvidius, is the eagerness of your demand that I should write to you in detail on such matters as are not contained in the books, and on such as bear reference to them, in short, as to the whole process of an affair which you were too young to be personally interested in. After Domitian had been put to death, I deliberated within myself, and resolved that here was a great and noble opportunity for pursuing the guilty, vindicating the unfortunate, and bringing one's self into notice. Further, BOOK IX. 299 among the numerous crimes of numerous people, none seemed more atrocious than that, in the Senate, a Senator should have laid hands on a Senator, a man of praetorian on a man of consular rank, a judge on an accused person. Independently of this, there was a friendship between myself and Helvidius as intimate as there could be with one who, through dread of the times, hid in seclusion his great name, and the great qualities which matched it. I was a friend, too, of Arria and Fannia, one of whom was Helvidius's stepmother, and the other that step- mother's parent. But I was not so much incited by private obligations as by public justice, by the disgraceful character of the deed, by a consideration of the example to be made. Accordingly, during the first few days of restored liberty, every one on his own account had been at once impeaching and crushing his own private enemies (at least the smaller ones) with a confused and turbulent clamour. I, for my part, deemed it a more temperate and also a more courageous course to attack a monstrous criminal, not by means of the popular resentment of the day, but by means of his own individual crime. So, as soon as that first impulse had sufficiently cooled down, and fury growing daily feebler had come back to a sense of justicethough I was at that time particularly sad, having lately lost my wife -I sent to Anteia, the widow of Helvidius, and asked her to come to me, since my still recent bereavement kept me within doors. On her arrival, \" It has been decided,\" said I, \" by me, not to suffer your husband to remain unavenged. Announce this to Arria and Fannia \" (they had returned from exile). \" Consult yourself, consult them, as to whether you wish to parti- cipate in an action in which I need no associate ; yet I am not so solicitous about my own glory as to grudge you a share in it.\" Anteia conveyed the message, and the ladies did not hesitate. The Senate, very opportunely, was to meet within three days. ' I always referred everything to Corellius, knowing liim for the most far-seeing and wisest man of our time. On this occasion, however, I was content with my own counsel, fearing that he would put his veto on it, for he was inclined to hesitation and caution. But I could not prevail on myself to refrain from intimating to him, the same day, what I was about to do in a matter about which I was not deliberating, having learnt by experience that, where you have made up your mind, it is best not to seek advice from those whose advice you would be bound to obey. I attended the Senate, begged leave to speak, and spoke for a short time with the greatest approval. When I began to touch on the charge, and to hint at a person to be charged (yet still without naming him), there came reclamations from all sides. Said one, \" Let us know who it is that you are accusing out of order ! \" Another, \" Who can be charged before being put in accusation by the Senate ? \" A third, \" Spare us who survive ! \" I heard them without perturbance or dismay ; such strength Kes in the goodness of one's cause ; and so great a difference does it make in the way of giving you confidence or frightening you, whether people do not like what you are doing, or do not approve of it. It would be tedious to recount everything that was thrown out from one quarter and another. Last of all the Consul said, \" Secundus, when you are called on for your vote, you will be able to speak if you choose.\" I replied, \" You will have accorded me a permission, which up to this time you have accorded to every one.\" I resumed my seat, and other business was transacted. Meanwhile, one of my friends of consular rank deeming me to have advanced myself with too much daring and rashness, reproved me in some private and anxious words, recalling me, and warning me to stop. He went so far as to add, \" You have made yourself a marked man in the eyes of future Princes.\" \" So be it,\" said I, \" provided BOOK IX. 301 they are bad Princes.\" Scarce had he departed, when again another, \" What daring is this ? Whither are you rushing ? What dangers are you throwing yourself in the way of ? Why trust to the present state of things, while uncertain as to the future ? You are attacking a man who is already Praefect of the Treasury, and who will shortly be Consul; a man, besides, supported by such interest and such connections ! \" He named a certain person, who at that time commanded a powerful and renowned army in the Eastnot without strong and suspicious rumours being connected with him. To this I answered, \"All Pve foreseen, and each event have weighed ? * Nor will I refuse, if fortune shall so bring it to pass, to suffer for a deed of the highest honour, provided I avenge one of the deepest guilt.\" It was now time for pronouncing our opinions. Domi- tius Apollinaris, Consul-Elect, spoke ; there spoke also Eabricius Veiento, Eabius Postumius, and Vettius Proculus, the colleague of Publicius Certus (the person under discussion), who was moreover the stepfather of the wife whom I had lost. After these came Ammius Flaccus. They all of them defended Certusthough he had not yet been named by mejust as though he had been named, and by their defence took up a charge which I had left, so to speak, unattached. What further they said it is not necessary to relate. You have it in the books, for I have gone through the whole, using their own words. Avidius Quietus and Cornutus Tertullus spoke on the other side. Quietus said, \" It would be most unjust that the complaints of aggrieved parties should be ex- cluded ; that, consequently, the right of presenting their plaints should not be taken from Arria and Fannia nor would he now endure to desert the duties of his office ; in the discharge of wliich, however, he would set bounds to his own grief, and would merely convey the extremely temperate sentiments of these admirable ladies. They were content to call the attention of the Senate to the bloodthirsty sycophancy of Publicius Certus, and to beg that, in case punishment for guilt of the clearest kind were remitted, he might at any rate be branded by some mark, like that inflicted by the Censor.\" Upon this, Satrius Eufus made a kind of half-and-half ambiguous speech. \" I think,\" said he, \" that injury has been inflicted on Publicius Certus, if he is not acquitted. He has been named by the friends of Arria and Fannia, and he has been named by his own friends. Nor ought we to feel a difficulty about this ; for we, the same who now pronounce favourably on the man, will also have to judge him.* If he is innocent, as I hope and wish, and, until something be proved against him, believe, you will be able to acquit him.\" So they spoke, in the order in which each was called upon. Then came my turn. I rose and preluded, as in the book, replying to each severally. It was astonishing with what attention, what plaudits, everything that fell from me was received by the very persons who had just before been crying out upon me. Such was the change which ensued, either from the great importance of the affair, or the success of the oration, or the intrepidity of the speaker. I came to an end. Veiento commenced replying, but no one would endure him. There was a great noise and disturbance, so great indeed as to make him say, \" I entreat, Conscript Fathers, that you will not compel me to invoke the aid of the Tribune.\" Upon which, Murena, the Tribune, immediately exclaimed, \" I give you leave to speak, most noble Veiento.\" Even then he was * The meaning seems to be, \"Do whitewash him. He -will still be sub- net be apprehensive that our present ject to be tried by us, in regular form, decision in his favour will entirely if evidence is adduced against him. \" shouted at. Meanwhile, the Consul called over the names, got through the diArision, and dismissed the Senate, leaving Veiento still almost on his legs and trying to speak. He complained loudly of this insult (so he called it), citing Homer's line -\" Old man, by younger warriors tliou'rt oppressed.\" * There \"was scarce any one in the Senate who did not embrace and salute me, and vie in loading me with praises for having reintroduced the practice, so long interrupted, of consulting the public welfare, at the risk of incurring personal animosities ; for having, in short, freed the Senate from the odium which was kindled against it among other orders, as being severe against the rest, and, with a kind of reciprocal connivance, indulgent to Senators alone. All this took place in the absence of Certus ; for he was absent, either because he suspected something of the kind, or (as the excuse was made for him) because he was ill. Caesar, indeed, did not refer to the Senate any communication with regard to him ; nevertheless I obtained what I had aimed at. For the colleague of Certus got the Con- sulship, and Certus himself was superseded, and what I had said at the end of my speech was completely carried out : \" Let him give up, under the best, the distinction which he obtained under the worst of Princes.\" Subsequently I put together again my speech, as best I could, and made many additions. It happened by chance (but so as not to appear like chance) that Certus died a victim to disease within a very few days after the publication of my book. I heard people relate how this was the image which flitted before his mind and his eyehe seemed to see me threatening him with a sword. Whether this was true or not I would not venture to say positively ; yet it would be to the interest of example that it should be held to be true. Here you have a letter which, if you consider the limits of a letter, is no shorter than the book you have read. But you must lay this to your own account, for not having been contented with the book. (14.) To Tacitus. You are not the man for self-applause ; yet there is nothing which I write with more sincerity than what I write about you. Whether posterity will have any care for us I know not, yet we certainly deserve that it should have some : I do not say on account of our genius (that would be arrogance), but on account of our zeal, our labours, our regard for posterity. Let us only pursue the road we have determined on, one which, though it may have conducted but few to sunlight and fame, has yet brought many out of obscurity and oblivion. (15.) To Falco. I fled for refuge to my Tuscan estate, with the view of acting according to my own fancy in all things ; but not even in my Tuscan estate is this possible. I am troubled with such numerous applications on all sides from the farmers, and such grumbling ones ; productions which I am rather more unwilling to read than my own writings ; for even my own writings I read unwillingly. I am retouching certain short speeches, a work which, after a temporary intermission, is insipid and disagreeable. The estate accounts are neglected, as though I were absent. Occasionally, however, I mount my horse, and act the landlord so far as to ride over some portion of the farms, though merely for exercise. Do you keep up your habit, and write me in full (since you see what sort of a country- man I am) of the doings in town. BOOK (Anon, n.d.) To Mamilianus. I do not wonder that you liave derived the greatest pleasure from such an abundant species of chase, when you write to me, after the manner of historians, that \" the numbers could not be counted.\" For my part, I have neither leisure nor inclination for hunting ; no leisure, because my vintage is on hand ; no inclination, because the vintage is small. However, in the place of new wine, I am draw- ing off* some new verses, and, as you are so polite in requiring them, will send them to you as soon as they shall seem to have laid aside their fermentation. (I7-) To Genitor. Your letter is to hand, in which you complain that a dinner of the most sumptuous description bored you, in consequence of buffoons, wantons, and fools strolling about the tables. Pray, smooth those wrinkles of yours a bit ! To be sure I keep nothing of the kind, yet I bear with those who do. Why don't I keep them ? Because I derive not the slightest pleasure either in the way of sur- prise or gaiety from any exhibition of looseness on the part of a wanton, or sauciness on the part of a buffoon, or silliness on the part of a fool. I am stating to you not my reasons, but my taste. And in truth, how many do you suppose there are who in the same way are offended at the things by which you and I are captivated and allured, deeming them to be partly foolish and partly irksome in a high degree ! How many there are who, when a reader, or a performer on the lyre, or a comedian is in- * Devchimus.

Let us then make allowance for other people's amusements, that we may obtain allowance for our own. (i8.) To Sabikus. How great has been the attention, the interest, the memory, in fine, with which you have read my small pro- ductions, is shown by your letter. You are therefore spontaneously cutting out work for yourself by enticing and alluring me to communicate to you as many as possible of my writings. I will do so, yet in parts at a time, and portioned out, so to speak, lest that very memory of yours which I have to thank should be confused by the constant succession and mass of matter, and, weighted and as it were oppressed, should lose its hold on par- To Euso.' You intimate to m^e that you have read in a certain letter of mine how Verginius Eufus ordered this epitaph to be placed on his tomb -\" Here Rufus lies, who Vindex overcame, Not for his own, but for his country's fame.\" * You find fault with him for having ordered this ; you go so far as to add that Frontinus acted better and more appropriately in forbidding any monument whatever to be erected to himself ; and you end by consulting me as to my opinion in either case. I loved both of them. I * See Book vi. Letter 10. BOOK IX. 307 bad the greater admiration for the one whom you find fault with ; such admiration, indeed, as to think that he never could be sufficiently praised, though I have now to undertake his defence. I judge all tliose who have done anything great and memorable to be in the liighest de- serving, not only of excuse, but actually of praise, if they pursue with eagerness the immortality which they have merited, and strive to prolong the renown of a name destined to live, even through the medium of sepulchral inscriptions. Nor can I easily find any one besides Ver- ginius whose modesty in setting forth his deeds has equalled his glory in performing them. I, who enjoyed his intimate affection and approval, can personally testify that only on a single occasion in my hearing did he go so far as to relate just this one anecdote on the subject of his own actions, namely, that Cluvius had once addressed him in these terms : \" You know, Verginius, the truthful- ness which is due to history ; accordingly, if you should read anything in my histories different from what you would wish, pray forgive me.\" To which he replied, \"Are you ignorant, Cluvius, that I did what I did precisely that it might be free to you authors to write what you chose ? \" Come, now, let us compare this very Frontinus in the very respect in which he seems to you more modest and restrained. He forbad a monument to be constructed; but in what words ? \" The expense of a monument is superfl.uous. My memory will endure if my life deserved it.\" Do you think it more modest to give out, to be read over the whole world, that one's memory will endure, than in one single spot to inscribe what you have done, in a couple of verses ? Though, to be sure, it is not my object to find fault with Frontinus, but to defend Vermnius : and what can be a juster defence of him, as far as you are con- cerned, than that which arises from a comparison with him of the person you have preferred ? In my judgment, indeed, neither of them is to be blamed, since both strove 3o8 PLINY'S LETTERS. after glory with equal longing, though by a different roadone by desiring the inscription which was his due, the other by choosing rather the appearance of despising it. (20.) To Venator. Your letter, assuredly, was all the more agreeable to me in proportion to its length, particularly as the whole of it was on the subject of my small productions ; and I do not wonder at these being a pleasure to you, since you love everything connected with me just as you love me in person. I am, at the present moment, gathering in my vintage, a slender one, to be sure, yet a more plentiful one than I had anticipatedif \"gathering in\" it can be called to pluck a grape now and then, to visit the press, to taste the new wine out of the vat, to drop in on my servants from town, who are now overlooking the country ones, and who have left me to the company of my secre- taries and readers. (Anon, n.d.) To Sabinianus. Your freedman, whom you told me you were so angry with, came to me and prostrated himself, and clung to my feet as though they had been your own. There were many tears, many prayers, and even much silence on his part ; in short, he convinced me of his penitence. I believe him to be truly amended, because he feels that he has sinned. You are angry, I know, and you are rightly angry, that I know too ; but it is precisely when there is the most just ground for anger that clemency is entitled to the highest praise. You have loved the man, and I hope you will love him again ; meanwhile it will suffice that you permit yourself to be entreated. It will be lawful for you to be angry with him anew if lie shall have deserved it ; and if you are entreated now, you will do this with a better excuse. Make some allowance in view of the man's youth, in view of his tears, in view of your owm goodness of heart. Do not torment him, and do not torment yourself into the bargain. For you are tormented, you, who are so gentle, when you are angry. I fear that I shall seem not so much to entreat as to compel, should my prayers be joined to his. I will, however, join them, and they are all the stronger and the more profuse in proportion to the sharpness and severity with which I reprimanded him, having strictly threatened him that I would never again make an appli- cation to you. So much to him, for it was proper that he should be frightened ; I do not say the same to you. Eor possibly I may again apply to you, and again obtain my object. May it only be such as it will become me to ask for and you to vouchsafe ! (22.) To Severus. The illness of Passienus Paullus has caused me great anxiety, and this for many excellent reasons. He is a man of the highest worth and honour, and one who is greatly attached to me ; moreover, in literature he rivals, recalls, and reproduces the ancients, particularly Propertius, from whom he is descended, whose genuine offspring he is, and whom he most resembles in the points in which the former excelled. If you take his elegiacs in hand, you will read a polished, dainty, charming book, an evident production of the household of Propertius. Eecently he has turned to lyrics, in which he presents us with Horace, just as in the former kind of poetry with Propertius. You would suppose, if relationship has any power in letters, that he must be Horace's kinsman as well. He is 3IO PLINY'S LETTERS. full of variety and flexibility. His love passages are those of a genuine lover ; he mourns like one who will not be consoled ; his praise is of the most benign, and his play- fulness of the most humorous character ; in short, he bestows the same pains on the tout ensemble as on the several parts. Sick in mind (no less than he was sick in body) on account of such a friend and such a genius, I have at length recovered him and have myself recovered* Congratulate me, congratulate literature itself too, which has encoiintered as great a risk from his peril as it will obtain glory in consequence of his safety, (Anon, n.d.) To Maximus. Often has it happened to me, when pleading, that the Centumviri, after keeping for a long while to their judicial dignity and gravity, have suddenlyas though vanquished and compelled to the actrisen from their seats in a body and applauded me. Often have I obtained from the Senate the highest glory I had aspired to. Yet never have I received greater pleasure than lately from what was told me by Cornelius Tacitus. He related how a Eoman knight was sitting by him at the last Circensian games. After a conversation of a varied and learned character, the gentleman asked him, \" Are you from Italy or the provinces ? \" He replied, \" You know me, and from your reading too.\" Upon which the other inquired, \" Are you Tacitus or Pliny ? \" I cannot express how delightful it is to me that our names, as though belonging to literature, and not to human beincts, are thus connected with literature ; that each of us is known by means of his pursuits, even to those to whom he is otherwise unknown. Another similar occurrence took place a very few days ago. That distinguished man Fabius Eufinus was my neighbour at table, and above him was one of his towns- * The jingle is in the original, Tandem ille, tandem me recepi. men, who liad come to Home that day for the first time. Eufinus, pointing me out to him, said, \" Do you see this gentleman ? \" and proceeded to talk at length of my literary pursuits. Said the other, \"It must be Pliny.\" To acknowledge the truth, I enjoy a great reward from my labours. Why, if Demosthenes was rightly delighted because an old woman of Athens recognised him in these terms, \" This is Demosthenes ! \" ought not / to rejoice in the celebrity of my name ? And truly I do rejoice, and own that I rejoice. Nor indeed do I fear to seem too much puffed up, since it is the opinion of others about me, and not my own, that I am putting forward ; and especially since this is to you, who not only do not grudge the praises bestowed on any man, but also favour those bestowed on me. (24-) To Sabinianus. You have done well in taking back to your home and your heart the freedman formerly so dear to you, with my letter for his passport.* This will be a satisfaction to you. It is certainly a satisfaction to me : first, because I see you to be so tractable that even in your anger you are capable of being ruled; in the next place, because you make so much account of me as either to yield to my authority or to comply with my prayers. So I praise as well as thank you. At the same time, I admonish you, as to the future, to show yourself placable in regard to the errors of those about you, even though there should be no one by to intercede in their behalf. yet, as though you were in entire enjoyment of the most complete repose, you read my sportive effusions and trifles, you delight in them, call for them, and strongly urge me to the composition of others like them. Indeed I begin to seek, not only recreation, but even glory, from this kind of pursuit, after the favourable judgment of a man so learned, so respected, and above all so truthful, as your- self. At present, business in court, though it does not entirely occupy me, still does so to some extent. When it is concluded, I sliall despatch some product of these same Muses to that kindliest bosom of yours. You will suffer my little sparrows and doves to fly among your eagles, on condition, however, of their being approved by you as well as by themselves. If the latter only, you will take care and shut them up in their cages or nests. (26.) To LUPERCUS. I once saidaptly, as I thinkof a certain orator of our epoch, who, though correct and sensible, was lacking in grandeur and ornamentation, \" His only sin is that he does not sin,\" Indeed, an orator ought to be excited and elevated, at times even to boil over and be hurried along, and so, often to approach a precipice ; for what is high and lofty generally has a chasm adjoining it. The road over a plain is safer, but at the same time humbler and lower ; runners meet with more falls than crawlers, but the latter get no credit for not falling, while the former get some, even though they do fall. For, as in the case of certain accomplishments, so in that of eloquencenothing commends it so much as its hazards. You see what ap- plause dancers on a lofty tight-rope generally elicit when they seem on the point of falling; for we most admire what is most unexpected and dangerous, and, as the Greeks more strongly express it, most \"dare-devilish.\" Hence the worth of a helmsman is by no means the same BOOK IX. J' J when sailing on a qniet as when on a stormy sea. In the former case he enters the harbour without being admired by any onewithout praise, without glory. But when the cordaQ-e creaks, and the mast bends, and the rudder groans, then what a great man he is, and how near to a sea-god ! Why all this ? Because you seem to me to have noted certain passages in my writings as being turgid which I thought elevated, as audacious which I thought bold, as extravagant which I thought full. Now, it makes a great difference whether what you note be reprehensible or merely conspicuous. For every one has his attention attracted by what is prominent and stands out in relief ; only, diligent attention is necessary for judging between what is sublime and what exceeds the bounds, what is lofty and what is extravagant. And, to quote Homer for choice, pray who can forget, whichever way they be judged, the words -\" All around The mighty heaven gave out a trumpet sound ; \" and \" His spear upon a cloud reclined ; \" and all that passage, \" Nor such the shout of Ocean's wave.\" But you want a tongued-balance and scales to ascertain whether these expressions are impossible and unmeaning, or on the other hand glorious and divine. Not that I am now supposing myself to have ever uttered or to be capable of uttering anything like this. I am not such a madman. But I only wish this to be understood, that the reins of eloquence should be left loose, and the flights of genius should not be restrained in the narrowest of circles. But it will be said that the conditions of oratory are one thing and those of poetry another. Just as if M. TuUius were less daring ! However, I pass him by, for indeed I do not think the subject admits of doubt. But Demosthenes himself, that pattern and model orator, pray does he contain or restrain himself when he utters those well- known words, \" Base, fawning, accursed wretches of men ! \" or again, \" It is not with stones or bricks that I have fortified the city ; \" and directly afterwards, \" Ought not Eubcea to have been made to flank Attica on the sea-board ? \" and elsewhere, \"For my part, Athenians, by the Gods, I think that the man is drunk with the magnitude of his own ex- ploits.\" What indeed can be more daring than that most exquisite and lengthy digression beginning with \" 'Tis a terrible malady \" ? How about this, shorter than the preceding, but equal in boldness, \" Then I (yielded not) to Python in his insolence and flowing with his full tide against you\" ? Of the same stamp is this, \" When a man is powerful through rapacity and wickedness, like this one, the first occasion, the smallest stumble, will altogether unseat and destroy him.\" A similar expression is \" Eoped off from all civic rights,\"* and in the same place, \"You, Aristogeiton, have surrendered all the pity that might have been felt for such deeds as these, or rather you have entirely extinguished it. Do not, therefore, come for anchorage to harbours which you have yourself blocked up and filled with piles.\" He had previously said, \" For I fear lest some may think that you are engaged in training such of the citizens as are desirous of turning out scoundrels.\" And afterwards, \" I see that none of these topics can offer a passage for this man, nothing but precipices and chasms and yawning pits.\"-f-It is not enough to say, \"For I do not understand that our ancestors built these courts for you in order that you might plant in them such fellows as these ; \" he adds, \" If he is a dealer and a retailer and a huckster in villainy,\" and a thousand things of the same kind, to pass over what ^schines called \"monstrosities,\" not \"expressions.\" * Demostli. c. Aristog. , p. 778. quotation, but this reverses the order Dr. Whiston renders differently, of the quotations in the original, and '•though debarred by all the prin-will not go with \"previously\" and ciples of the state.\" \"afterwards.\" + Keil transposes this and the above BOOK IX. I have clianced upon what seems to contradict me. You will say that even Demosthenes is found fault with in these respects ; but just see how much greater is the person criticised than the critic himself, and greater actually on account of these very things. For in other points his power, in these his sublimity shines forth. And pray did ^schines himself abstain from what he reproved in Demosthenes? \"For the orator and the law should speak in unison ; but when the law sends out one voice and the orator another. . . .\" Elsewhere, \" Since it appears that concerning everything, in the decree. . . .\" Again elsewhere, \" But, sitting and lying in wait for him at the hearing, drive him into lawless language,\" which he so much approved as to repeat, \" But as in the horse-races, drive him to the same course in the business.\" Pray is this more guarded or temperate, \" You are irritating the wound, . . . seizing him as a political pirate sailing throuo;h the state,\" and the rest of it ? I expect that some things in this very letter, as, for in- stance, the expression, \" The rudder groans,\" and \" Near to a sea-god,\" will be spitted * by you with the same marks of disapproval as those about which I write. For I am aware that while apologising for previous passages of mine I have fallen into the very things which you had set your mark to. However, I give you leave to spit them, pro- vided ouly you at once appoint a day when we may treat in person both of the other passages and of these. For either you shall make me cautious,-f-or else I shall make you rash. in short, there is in history ! This I have lately, as well as * With the ohtlus, a mark in the by MS. authority, would perhaps be shape of a spit, indicating disapproval better, \"Either you shall prove me or doubt. to be turgid, or I shall prove you to \\Tiniidum, rumtduni, if supported be rash.\" 3i6 PLINY'S LETTERS. on numerous other occasions, experienced. A gentleman had recited a composition strongly marked by truth, and had reserved a portion of it for another day. Lo and behold the friends of a certain personage begged and entreated him not to recite the remainder. Such is the shame of listening to what they have done, on the part of the very people who are not in the least ashamed of doing what they blush to listen to. As for the writer, he granted their request, a thing which honour permitted him to do. The composi- tion, however, like the deed itself, remains, and will re- main, and will always be read, and that all the more be- cause not immediately. For men are stimulated to make acquaintance with what is deferred. (28.) To KOMANUS. After a long interval I have received your lettersthree at the same time, howeverall of them very choice and friendly compositions, and such as letters coming from you should be, particularly when they are so greatly desired. In one of these you impose on me a most agreeable service, that of forwarding your communications to that august lady Plotina.* They shall be forwarded. In the same letter you commend to me Popilius Arte- misius. I immediately granted his request. You also intimate to me that you have got in but a moderate vintage. This complaint is common to both of us, though in such widely different parts of the world. In your second letter you announce that you are at times dictating, and at others writing, a good deal having for its object to bring me before your mind. I thank you, and would thank you still more if you had allowed me to read the actual compositions which you are writing or dic- tating. And it would be fair that I should be made * Tlie wife of the Emperor Trajan. BOOK IX. 317 acquainted with your writings, just as you have been with mine, even although they had related to some other person than myself. At the end, you promise^so soon as you shall have heard anything definite about my arrange- mentsthat you will play the runaway to your belong- ings and forthwith fly off to me, who am already preparing chains for you such as you will in nowise be able to break through. The third letter contained news that my oration for Clarius had reached you, and that it had seemed to you fuller than when you heard me speak it. It is fuller ; for I subsequently made many additions to it. You add that you sent me another letter more carefully composed, and you ask whether I have received it. I have not received it, and I long to do so. Accordingly, send me a copy on the very first opportunity, with something added to it by way of interest, which I shall compute (can I put it lower ?) at twelve per cent. (29O To EusTicus. Just as it is better to excel in any one pursuit than to do a number of things moderately well, so it is better to do a number of things moderately well, if you are unable to excel in any one. Observing this, I try my hand at various kinds of literature, not being sufficiently con- fident about any of them. So when you read this or that of mine, allow for each single composition a^n ot stand- ing by itself. Pray, in the case of the other arts, is the number of productions an excuse for shortcomings ; and is there to be a harder law in the case of literature, in which the execution is so much more difficult ? Yet why do I talk of allowance, like an ingrate ? For if you receive my newest productions with the same favour as the preceding ones, I have rather to hope for praise than 3r8 PLINY'S LETTERS. to supplicate allowance. However, the latter will be sufficient for me. (30.) To Geminus. Tou praise your friend Nonius to meoften by word of mouth, and now by letterfor being so generous towards certain people. And so do I praise him, provided he is not so towards these alone. For I will have it that the truly generous man gives to his country, his relations, his connections, his friends ; I speak of his poor friends, not like those who choose as the objects of their donations such as can best make a return. I consider these people with their presentsall smeared with bird-lime, and furnished with a hookto be not so much brinirinG; forth out of their own as clutching at other people's property. Tliose are of a like character, who take from one what they give to another, seeking through avarice a reputation for generosity. Now, the jirincipal thing is to be content with one's own ; after that, to support, to cherish, and, as it were, to encompass in a circle of fellowship those whom one knows to be particularly in need. If your friend does all these things, he is thoroughly to be commended ; if any one of them, to a smaller degree indeed, yet still to be commended, so rare is the type of even imperfect generosity. Such a passion for getting has seized on men that they seem to be taken possession of rather than to be possessors. (Anon, n.d.) To Sardus. Since leaving you, I have been no less in your company than when with you. For I have read your book, reperusing ever and anon those parts cliiefly (I will not BOOK IX. 319 deny the truth) in which you have written about me. In these indeed you have been particularly copious. How many and how varied tlie things you have saidthings which, though about the same person, are not the same, and yet do not contradict each other. Shall I commend you, and thank you at the same time ? I can do neither sufficiently, and, even if I could, should fear it might be presumptuous to commend you on account of what I had to thank you for. This only will I add, that everything in your book seemed to me the more commendable in proportion as it was agreeable to me, and the more agree- able in proportion as it was commendable. (32.) To TiTIANUS. What are you about ? And what are you going to be about ? Por my part, I am leading the pleasantest, that is, the idlest, of lives. Hence it comes to pass that I don't like writing long letters, and like reading themthe former in my character of an exquisite, and the latter in that of an idler. For there is nothing more slothful than your exquisite, or more inquisitive than your idler. To Caninius. I have fallen in with a subject which, though true, bears a close resemblance to fiction, and is worthy of your lively and elevated and thoroughly poetical genius. I fell in with it, moreover, among a variety of marvels which were being related by different guests at a dinner- party. The authority for it is a man of the highest veracity ; though, by the by, what has a poet got to do with veracity ? However, this particular authority is such as you miglit have trusted, even if you had designed to write history. There is in Africa a colonial town named Hippo, close to the sea. Adjoining it is a navigable lagoon, out of which flows an estuary after the manner of a river, whose waters are alternately carried to the sea or returned to the lagoon, according as they are driven back or impelled by the tide. The inhabitants of every age are strongly addicted to fishing, boating, and likewise swimming; particularly the boys, who are attracted by idleness and sport. In their eyes, it is glory and renown to swim out a long way ; the victor is he who has left the shore, as well as his fellows, the furthest distance behind him. In this kind of contest, a certain lad, bolder than the rest, was getting far out to sea. Suddenly a dolphin met him, and at one time went in front of, at another followed, and then swam round him, at last took him on his back, then put him off, then took him on again, next bore the trem- bling lad seaward, and presently turning back to the shore, restored him to terra firma and his companions. The report of this crept through the town; all the inhabitants flocked up and contemplated the lad himself as a kind of prodigy, they questioned him, and listened to him, and repeated his story. Next day they took posses- sion of the shore, and gazed upon the sea and everything that looked like sea.* The boys swam, and among them the one in question, but with greater caution. Again to time came the dolphin, and again he made for the boy, who fled with his companions. The dolphin, as though inviting and recalling him, leapt out of the water, and dived and twined and untwined himself in a variety of circles. The same thing happened the next day, and a third day, and on several days, till these men, brought up to the sea, began to be ashamed of their fears. They approached and called to him jestingly ; they even handled him, and he submitted to be stroked. * The lagoon and the estuary as well as the sea. BOOK IX. 321 grew by use. But, before all others, the boy wlio had had the first experience of hini, swam by hnu, jumped on his back, was carried to and fro, and, fancying he was recognised and loved by him, was himself taken with love for the dolphin. Neither of them is afraid, neither is an object of fear, the confidence of the one and the tameness of the other go on increasing. Other boys too, on the right and left, swim with their friend, cheering and exhorting him. What is also marvellous, another dolphin accompanied this one, but only in the character of a spectator and attendant, for he neither performed nor submitted to any- thing of the same kind; he merely led the other and escorted him back, just as the rest of the boys did with this boy. Though it seems incredible (yet it is just as true as what has preceded), this dolphin, that carried and played with boys, would often leave his element for the land, and after drying himself in the sands, would, as soon as he had grown warm, roll back into the sea. It is ascertained that Octavius Avitus the Pro-consular Legate, led by a vicious superstition, poured ointment on him after he had been attracted to the shore, and that the strangeness of the thing and the smell caused him to escape back into the deep, and that he was not seen for many days afterwards, and then languid and dull ; yet soon afterwards he regained his spirits, and resumed his former friskiness and his accustomed offices. There was a confluence of all the officials of the province to see the sight, whose arrival and sojourn were exhausting the modest revenues of the town in unwonted expenses. Finally, the place itself was parting with its repose and retired character. It was decided to put to death privately the object of all this assemblage. With what tender commiseration, with what exuberance, will you weep over and embellish and exalt this tale! There is, however, no need for your inventing or adding anything fresh to it. It will suffice if what is true suffer no diminution. X (34-) To Tkanquillus. Eelieve me of my difficulty. I hear that I read badlypoetry at leastorations, indeed, well enough, and, on that very account, poetry less well. So being about to have a recitation before some intimate friends, I am thinking of making trial of my freedman. This, too, is a mark of in- timacy that I have selected a man who will not read well, though he will read better than me, provided he does not become confused, for he is as unpractised a reader as I am a poet, Now what I myself am to do all the time he is reading I know not. Should I sit wrapt and mute and like a person with nothing in hand ? Or, after the fashion of some, should I accompany his delivery with mutterings and motions of the eyes and hands ? But I fancy I am as bad at pantomime as at reading. Again, I say, relieve me of my difficulty, and write me back word candidly whether it be better to read execrably than to be either doing or not doing such things as these. (35.) -To Atrius. I have received the book you sent me, and thank you for it. I am, however, at the present time greatly occupied. Consequently I have not yet read it, though for the rest extremely anxious to do so. But I owe such re- spect not only to literature itself, but also to your writings, as to deem it impiety to take them in hand save with a mind quite disengaged. I strongly approve your diligence in the revision of your works. Yet there is a certain limit to this ; in the first place, because too much care serves to impair rather than to emend ; next, because it calls us off from newer attempts, and, while it does not \\ BOOK IX. 323 make perfect what went before, prevents us from com- mencing what ought to come after. (36.) To Fuscus. You ask how I dispose of my day in summer-time at my place iu Tuscany. I wake when I choose, generally about six o'clock, often before that, rarely later. My windows remain closed ; for, thus marvellously with- drawn from all distractions, by means of the silence and the darkness, I am my own master and am left to myself; I make my eyes wait on my mind, not my mind on the eyes ; and the eyes will see the same things as the mind, when they have nothing else to see. I ponder whatever I have in hand, ponder it just as if writing it out word for word and correcting it, at one time a shorter, at another a longer portion, according as it has been difficult or easy to compose or to recollect. I call for my amanuensis, and, letting in the daylight, dictate what I have put together ; he goes away, is recalled, is dismissed afresh. At ten or eleven o'clock (for the time is not fixed or subject to regulation), according to the weather, I betake myself to the terrace-walk or else to the cloisters, where I meditate and dictate the sequel ; then I get into my carriage. There, too, I employ myself in the same way as when walking or lying on my couch ; my attention remains constant, being refreshed by the change itself. Next, I go to sleep again for a short time, then walk, and presently read a Greek or Latin oration aloud and with emphasis, not so much for the sake of my voice as my digestion, yet my voice is also strengthened at the same time. Again I walk, am anointed, exercise myself and bathe. At dinner, if taken in company with my wife or a small party, a book is read out. After dinner comes the comedian or a performer on the lyre ; shortly after- wards, I take a stroll with my attendants, in the mimher of whom are some persons of cultivation. In this way the evening is occupied by varied conversation, and the day, however long, is soon brought to an end. At times some changes are made in the above disposi- tion. Tor if I have been a long while on my couch, or walk- ing, it is only after a nap and a reading that I take the air, not in a carriage, butwhich takes less time, as being more rapidon horseback. Friends drop in with their visits from the neighbouring villages, engrossing to themselves part of my day ; and now and then, when I am wearied with study, these seasonable interruptions are of service to me. Occasionally I hunt, but not without my note-books, so that, if I fail in tahing something, I may at any rate have some- to bring Iwme. Some time, though not, as they think, enough, is given to my tenants, whose rustic grumblings enhance the pleasures of my literary pursuits, and of those occupations which smack of the city. (Anon, n.d.) To Paulinus. It is not in your nature to exact customary and, as it were, conventional services irom your intimates, against their own convenience; and, moreover, my affection for you is too steadfast to make me fear that you will take it otherwise than I could wish if I fail to attend immediately on the Kalends -to see you made Consul, particularly as I am detained by the necessity of letting my farms, a busi- ness which will settle matters for several years, and in connection with which I shall have to make fresh arrange- ments. Tor during the last five years, though the tenants have had large remissions made them, their arrears have grown : hence most of them have ceased to take any pains to diminish debts which they despair of being able to pay in full. They even ravage and consume the produce, as though they began to think that if they spared it it would BOOK IX. 325 not be for their own benefit * These increasing abuses must consequently be met and remedied. The only plan for remedying them is to let the farms, not at a fixed rent, but for a share of the produce, and then to set some of my servants to supervise the work and guard the crops ; and in any case, there is no fairer return than that which the soil, the climate, and the seasons bring in. This plan, it is true, requires great honesty, sharp eyes, and numerous hands. Yet the experiment must be made ; and, as in the case of a disease of long standing, we must try and resort to any kind of change. You see it is no fanciful reason which prevents me from attending on the first day of your Consulship, which I shall nevertheless celebrate here, just as if I were there, with prayers and joy and congratulations. To Saturninus. I do praise our friend Eufus, not because you begged me to do so, but because he is most worthy of praise. For I have read his book, so perfect in all points, and my love for the writer added much to its favour with me. Yet I exercised my judgment on it ; nor indeed do those only exercise their judgments who read with ill-natured intent. (39-) To MusTius. By the advice of the Haruspices, the temple of Ceres, which stands on my property, will have to be repaired, embellished, and enlarged. It is, to be sure, old and small, though, for all that, it is very crowded on a particular day. For, on the Ides of September, a large assemblage is gathered there from the whole district, mii(;h business is transacted, many vows are undertaken, and many are paid, yet there is no refuge near at hand against either the rain or the svm. It seems to me, therefore, that I shall be acting in accordance with the dictates of generosity as well as of religion by constructing the temple in the handsomest style, and adding to it a colonnadethe former for the use of the goddess, the latter for the use of men. Consequently I should be obliged by your buying four columns of marble, of whatever sort you think fit ; also by your buying marble for the adornment of the floor and the walls. Moreover, there will have to be either made or bought a statue of the goddess herself, because the old one which is there, and which is of wood, is in some of its parts mutilated througli age. As to the colonnade, nothing occurs to me in the interval which seems to be required from your neighbourhood, unless indeed you would draw up a plan in accordance with the locality. It cannot be built round the temple, for the ground on which the temple stands is closed in on one side by a river with extremely steep banks, and on the other by a road. Beyond the road there is an extensive meadow, in which the colonnade might find space conveniently enough, opposite to the temple itself (40.) To Fuscus, You write that yon were much pleased with my letter, from which you learnt how I spend my summer holidays on my Tuscan estate, and you inquire what of all this is changed in winter-time at my Laurentine villa. Kothing, except that my midday siesta is cut off, and a good deal is taken from the night, either before sunrise or after sunset and if there is any pressing necessity for appearing in court (as there often is in winter) there is no longer place for a comedian or a lyrical performer after dinner, but I often go over again what I have dictated, and at the same time my memory is helped by this frequent revision. You now know my habits in summer and in winter. You may add to this, spring and autumn, in which, as being the intermediate seasons between summer and winter, I lose nothing of my working day, and gain a little • from the night. n '-) 8 ) BOOK X. CORRESPONDEXCE WITH TRAJAN\". (I.)* To Teajan. Though your dutiful affection had made you desire, most august Emperor, to succeed your father at as late a period as possible, yet the immortal gods have hastened to advance your great virtues to the helm of the State, of vs^hich you had already undertaken the administration.-}* I pray, then, that all prosperityin other words, all tliat is worthy of your epochmay fall to your lot, and, through you, to that of the human race. I offer private as well as public aspirations for your health and spirits, most noble Emperor. (2.) To Tkajan. I cannot express in words, my Liege, what joy you have conferred on me, in that you have deemed me worthy of the rights belonging to the father of three children ; :|: for though you have conceded this to the prayers of Julius Servianus, an admirable man, most devoted to you, yet I understand from your rescript itself that you have granted it all the more willingly, because he was asking on my account. I seem, then, to have attained the summit of my wishes, now that at the commencement of your most aus- * la the numbering of these letters, pire, and, on the death of the latter, which differs in different editions, I acceded to the supreme rule, \"the have followed Keil. helm of the State.\" \"f-Trajan had been associated with % See ii. 13, note, his adopted father, Nerva, in the Em-BOOK X. And all the greater is my longing for children, whom I wished to have even in the dismal period that is past, as you may judge from my two marriages. But the gods have decreed better, who reserved things as they were till your kindly reign. They preferred that I should become a father, rather at this time, when I should be destined to be one in security and happiness. 3 A (20). To Trajan. The moment, sir, I was promoted by your favour, and that of your father, to the post of Prefect of the Treasury of Saturn, I renounced all employment as an advocate (which, independently of this, I had never exercised in a promiscuous fashion), in order to devote my whole atten- tion to the functions delegated to me. For which reason, when the Provincials chose me as their patron against Marius Prisons, I begged to be excused this office, and obtained my wish. But when subsequently the Consul- Elect gave it as his opinion that we, whose excuse had been accepted, should be urged to place ourselves at the disposal of the Senate, and to suffer our names to be thrown with others into the urn,* I deemed it most in accord with the even tenor of your reign not to resist the desire, especially such a moderate one, of the most honour- able House. I hope that tliis compliance of mine will be thought by you to be justified, since it is my wish to make all my acts and deeds approved to your most noble dispo- sition. Trajan to Pliny. You have discharged the part of a good citizen and a good Senator in yielding that compliance, which was so * That is, to suffer ourselves to be voted for by the Senate, justly required of you, to the most honourable House. And I have full confidence that you will carry out this part in faithful accord with your undertaking. Pliny to Tkajan. Your kindness, most noble Emperor, which is experi- enced by me to the full, prompts me to be so bold as to lie under obligation to you on behalf of my friends as well. Among these, Voconius Eomanus claims for himself, I would say, even the first place, my schoolfellow and com- panion from early life ; for which reasons I had already asked the deceased Emperor, your father, to promote him to senatorial rank. But this prayer of mine has been reserved for your grace, since the mother of Eomanus had not yet completed, with due formalities, the gift of four hundred thousand sesterces,* which she had under- taken to bestow on her son in a petition addressed to your father. This she did afterwards on my admonition ; for she has made over to him certain estates, and has accom- plished the remaining forms which are usually required for completing a transfer. Seeing, then, that what delayed my hopes is now settled, it is not without considerable assurance that I pledge you my credit for the character of my friend Eomanus, set off as it is by literary acquire- ments, and by his remarkable family affection, which has deserved for him this very benefaction from his mother, as well as his immediate entrance on his father's estate and his adoption by his stepfather. All this is enhanced by the splendour of his birth and of his paternal property, and I have such confidence in your kindness as to believe that these several matters will actually receive much additional recommendation from my prayers. I therefore * About ;^320o.' Quadringentorum usual reading, quadringenties (about miliiuvi, suggested by Gesner. The ;^32o,ooo), seems absurd.

To Teajan. Last year, sir, being tormented by a severe disease, even to the peril of my life, I engaged a doctor on the latra- liptic system,* whose solicitude and zeal I can make an equal return for, only through favour of your kindness. Wherefore I pray you to grant him the Roman citizenship ; for his status is that of a foreigner, and he was manumitted by a foreign lady. His own name is Harpocras. His patroness was Thermuthis, the wife of Theon,-f-who is long since dead. At the same time, I would beg you to grant naturalisation \\ to Hedia and Harmeris, the freed- women of a most distinguished lady, Antonia Maximilla ; a request which I make of you at the desire of their patroness. To Teajan. I thank you, sir, for granting, without delay, naturalisa- tion to the freedwoman of a lady who is a friend of mine, as well as the Eoman citizenship to Harpocras, my latra- liptic doctor. § But when I had given in the age and * a system or cure by means of Eel., vi.

Letter 5. fortune of the latter, as you had bidden me to do, I was informed by persons of greater experience that, inasmuch as he was an Egyptian, I ought first to have obtained for him tlie citizenshij) of Alexandria, and afterwards that of Rome. For my part, liowever, owing to my thinking that there was no difference between Egyptians and other foreigners, I was content simply to write to you to the effect that he had been manumitted by a foreign lady, and that his patroness was long since dead. I will not com- plain of this ignorance of mine, since it has been the cause of my being under more frequent obligations to you on account of the same person. I beg, therefore, in order that your favour may be lawfully enjoyed by me, that you would accord him the citizenship of Alexandria as well as of Eome. His age and fortune (that there may be no fresh delay in the way of your kindness) I have sent in to those freedmen of yours to whom you ordered me to send them. Teajan to Pliny. I have made it a rule, in accordance with the established custom of the emperors, to be cautious in bestowing the citizenship of Alexandria; but since you have already obtained that of Eome for Harpocras, your latraliptic doctor,* I cannot bring myself to refuse this further application of yours. You will have to inform me from what district he comes, that I may forward you a letter for my friend Pompeius Planta, the Prefect of Egypt. To Teajan. Your late imperial father, sir, having exhorted all citizens to the exercise of liberality, as well in an admirable discourse as by his own most noble example, I begged * Note, Letter 5. J of liim that some statues of emperors (wliich had been handed down to me through several successions, and which I was taking care of, just as I had received them, on some distant estates of mine) might, by his leave, be transferred to the chief town, with the addition of his own statue. This he accorded me, with the most ample expression of his approval, and I at once wrote to the Decurions * to assign me a piece of ground on which I might build a temple at my own expense. They, in honour of the work itself, offered me the choice of a situation. But I was prevented first by my own and next by your father's ill- ness, and subsequently by the cares of the office which you and he imposed on me. Noiv, it seems to me that I can most conveniently make an excursion to the spot itself ; for my mouth of attendance expires on the Kalends of September, and the following month has many holidays in it. I beg therefore, before all things, that you will permit me to embellish the work I am about to com- mence, by the addition of your statue ; and next, in order that I may do this as soon as possible, that you will grant me a furlough. Yet it is not consistent with my straight- forwardness to dissemble from your grace that you will incidentally render a great service to my private interests. For the lettings of the estates in my possession in this very district, besides that they exceed the sum of four hundred thousand sesterces,+ are so far from being a matter capable of being deferred that the new tenants must immediately prune the vines. Moreover, successive bad seasons compel me to think of making remissions, and I cannot calculate these except on the spot. I shall owe then, sir, to your favour both the acceleration of my pious project and the settlement of my affairs, if on both these accounts you grant me a furlough of thirty days. Indeed I cannot fix beforehand a shorter period, since the town and the estates of which I speak are beyond the hundred and fiftieth milestone from the city. * The Town Council, as in i. 8. f About ;C3200. 9 (25). Teajan to Pliny. You have given me many reasons, public as well as private,* for requesting a furlough. As far as I am con- cerned, however, your simple desire would have sufficed. For I do not doubt that you will return the moment you are able to a post which makes such calls on you as yours does. Though very sparing of honours of this description, yet I permit a statue to be erected to me in the place you wish, lest I should seem to impede the flow of your affec- tion toward me. 10 (5). To Teajan, I cannot express in words, sir, the joy communicated to me by your letters, from which I learnt that you had granted in addition the citizenship of Alexandria on Harpocras, my latraliptic doctor,f though you had made it a rule, in accordance with the established custom of the emperors, to be cautious in bestowing it. I must now signify to you that Harpocras is from the district of Memphis, and must ask you therefore, most indulgent Emperor, to send me a letter for your friend Pompeius Planta, the Prefect of Egypt, according to promise. As I am going to meet you, my Liege, in order the sooner to enjoy the delight of your eagerly expected advent, I pray that you will permit me to go as far as possible to your encounter. To Teajan. My recent illness, sir, has placed me under an obliga- tion to Postumius Marimis, a physician, to whom I can * MuUas et privatas et puhlicas text he has, Et multas et \\pmncs\\ caiisas.

At the same time I beg you to grant naturalisation to L. Satrius Abascantus, P. Caesius Phosphorus, and Pancharias Soteris. This I ask of you with the consent of their patrons. 12 (7). To Tkajan. I know, sir, that my prayers are implanted in that memory of yours, so retentive in the matter of kindly actions. Since, however, you have indulged me on this subject as well as on others, I must remind you and at the same time earnestly entreat you to deign to honour Accius Sura with the Prsetorship whenever the post is vacant. To this hope, though otherwise a most retiring man, he is exhorted both by the splendour of his birth and the great integrity which he showed in poverty, and, above all, by the felicity of the times which invites and elevates the good consciences of your subjects to the experience of your kindness. To Tkajan. Since I know, sir, that it will pertain to the attestation and approval of my character to be distinguished by the judgment of so excellent a prince, I beg that you will * Boiiitas tua here, as in previous like '* your grace,\" was formerly adletters (4 and 8), was applied as a sort dressed to English kings), \" your ex- of title, as \"your highness\" (which, cellence,\" &o. deign to add to the dignity to which your favour has advanced me the post either of Augur or of Septemvir, seeing that they are vacant, that by right of my sacred office I may be able to pray to the gods for you publicly as I now pray to them in my private devotions. To Trajan. I hail with congratulations, most excellent Emperor, both on your own account and that of the State, this victory of yours, so great, so noble, so worthy of antiquity ! And I pray the immortal gods that all your counsels may be followed by a like happy event, that by your lofty virtues the glory of the empire may be renewed as well as increased. 15 (26). To Trajan. As I am convinced, sir, that the news will be of interest to you, I beg to announce that I have sailed past the pro- montory of Malea and reached Ephesus, with all my suite, though retarded by contrary winds. Now I propose to make for my province, partly by coasting-boats, partly by land conveyances. Eor as the excessive heats are an im- pediment to a land journey, so in like manner the Etesian winds * oppose continuous navigation. Trajan to Pliny. You were quite right in reporting to me, my dearest Secundus. Eor I am greatly interested in the way you have taken for reaching your province. Your determina- tion is prudent, too, to use ships at one time and land conveyances at another, as may be recommended by the localities. * Annual winds, blowing from the north. BOOK X. 2zy 17 A (28). To Tkajan. Just as I experienced a very healthy voyage as far as Ephesus, sir, so when I had commenced my land journey from that point, I was troubled with the most scorching heats and even slight attacks of fever, and stopped at Per- gamus. Again, on changing into the coasting-boats, I was retarded by contrary winds, and did not arrive in Bithynia till somewhat later than I had hoped, that is to say, on the seventeenth of September. I cannot, however, complain of the delay, since I was fortunate enough to be able to celebrate your birthday in the province, a most aus- picious circumstance. Now I am examining into the ex- penditure, revenues, and debts due to the commonwealth of Prusa, and the inspection itself shows me more and more the necessity of this. For many sums of money are retained, on various pretexts, by private individuals ; besides, some are laid out in expenditure that is anything but legitimate. The above, sir, I wrote directly on my arrival. 17 B. To Tkajan\". On the seventeenth of September, sir, I came to my province, which I found in that state of submission and loyalty to you which you deserve on the part of mankind. Pray, sir, consider whether you deem it necessary to send here an architect.* For it seems that no small amount may be got back from those in charge of the public constructions, if the measurements are faithfully executed. So I certainly foresee, from the accounts of the Prusenses, which I am at this moment examining. * Mensor. An architect and clerk of the works. Y 1 8 (29). Trajan to Pliny. I wish you could have reached Bithynia without any damage to your slender frame or to your suite, and that your journey from Ephesus had resembled the seavoyage which you had experienced up to that point. As to the day of your arrival in Bithynia, I was informed of that, dearest Secundus, by your letter. The provincials will, I trust, understand that I have had their interests in view. For you, for your part, will take care to make it plain to them that you have been selected to be sent to them as repre- senting me. Before all things, however, you should examine the public accounts, for that they are * in a state of confusion is quite clear. As for architects, I have scarce enough of them even for the works which are being carried on in Eome and its vicinity. But in every province persons are to be found who can be trusted ; so they will not fail you, if only you choose to make diligent search for them. To Trajan. I beg, sir, you would direct me by your counsel, who am in doubt whether I ought to intrust the custody of pri- soners to the public slaves (which has been the custom to this time) or to soldiers. For I fear the public slaves may not guard them with sufficient fidelity, and on the other hand that this occupation may distract f no small num- ber of soldiers. Meanwhile, I have added a few soldiers to the public slaves. Yet I see there is a danger that this very arrangement may be a cause of negligence to both * Nam et eas esse vexatas. Gierig t Distringat liere in the proper sense proposes namque. If et be retained, of \" withdraw from somethin^',\" i.e., the meaning must be \"they as well withdraw from !,their usual occupa- as other things.\" tion. BOOK X. 339 parties, each party making sure that they will be able to retort upon the others the neglect common to both of (Anon, n.d.). Trajan to Pliny. There is no need, dearest Secundus, that a number of our fellow-soldiers should be transferred to the guard of prisoners. Let us persevere in the custom, which is that of your province, of guarding them by means of the public slaves. For indeed their doing this faithfully depends on your strictness and vigilance. The great fear certainly is, as you write, that by mixing up soldiers with public slaves, both parties, by trusting in each other, will be made more careless. And besides, let us not forget this, that the smallest possible number of soldiers should be called away from the standards. Pliny to Trajan. Gavins Bassus, the Prefect of the coast of Pontus, came to me most respectfully and dutifully, sir, and remained with me several days. As far as I could discern, he is an excellent man, and one worthy of your favour. I informed him of your orders, that out of the cohorts which you had been pleased to place me in command of, he must be con- tented with ten beneficiarii,* two horsemen and one cen- turion. He replied that this number would not suffice him, and that he would write to you to that effect. This was the reason why I did not think it proper at once to recall those he has with him over the number, 22 (33). Trajan to Pliny. Gavins Bassus has written to me too, that the number of soldiers which I had directed to be assigned to him was insufficient. That you may know my reply, I have ordered it to be appended to this letter. It makes a great differ- ence whether necessity requires, or whether people are merely wanting to extend their commands.* For us, the public advantage is alone to be considered, and as far as possible care be taken that the soldiers be not absent from their standards. To Teajan. The people of Prusa, sir, have public baths which are both mean and old. They desire, therefore, with your kind permission, to restore them. I, however, being of opinion that new ones should be built ... it seems to me that you might indulge them in their desire. For there will be money out of wliich this may be done : first, that which I have already begun to call in and claim from private individuals ;-f-secondly, that which they them- selves have been in the habit of expending on oil, and are now prepared to contribute towards the building of the baths. This is a work besides, which is demanded both by the importance of the city and the glory of your reign. Trajan to Pliny. If the construction of new baths is not likely to burden the resources of the Prusenses, we are able to indulge them * The original is uncertain. Mul-perare latius velint is the conjecture turn interest res poscat an homines im-of Catanseus. t See Letter 17 a. BOOK X. 341 in their desire, provided always that in no way are they either to be taxed for this object, or have their means impaired for the future in respect to the necessary expenditure of the State. To Trajan. Servilius Pudens, my lieutenant, sir, arrived at Nieo- media on the twenty-fourth of November, and freed me from the anxiety of a long expectation. To Trajan. Rosianus Geminus, sir, has been attached to me with the closest bonds by means of the favour you have conferred on me. For I had him for my QuaBstor during my consulship, when I found him a most loyal subordinate. Since my consulship he exhibits the same respect for me, and heaps private services upon the proofs he had given of our public friendship. I beg, then, that in accordance with his worth, and in compliance with my prayers,* you will conceive a favourable opinion of one to whom, if you have any confidence in me, you will further exhibit marks of your kindness. He himself will take care, in the discharge of what you shall commit to him, to deserve still greater things. I am rendered more sparing in my praises of him by the hope that his integrity and virtue and industry are particularly known to you, not only from the offices which he has filled in the city under your eyes, but also from the fact of his having served in the army with you. The one thing which, in consequence of my affection for him, I do not seem to myself to have yet done fully enough, I must * Precibus meis faveas cui, etc. If ferent turn will be given to the sen- precibus meis be taken as tbe dative tence. governed by faveas, a somewhat dif-do again and again ; that is, I must beg of you, sir, that it be your pleasure with all speed to cause me to rejoice at the advancement in dignity of my Quaestor, or, in other words, through him of myself. To Trajan. Maximus, sir, your freedman and provincial agent, assures me that, besides the ten beneficiarii * which you commanded me to assign to the worthy Gemellinus, he is himself likewise in want of soldiers ... of these in the meanwhile. ... I thought that the number I found should be left at his service, particularly as he was going to Paphlagonia to procure corn. Moreover, for the sake of protection, I added, at his desire, two horsemen. I would beg of you to write me word what practice you would have observed for the future. Trajan to Pliny. On the present occasion, you have been quite right in furnishing my freedman Maximus with soldiers, as he was setting out to procure corn, For he, as well as they, was discharging an extraordinary office. But when he shall have returned to his pristine functions, he must be content with the two soldiers assigned him by you and the same number by Virdius Gemellinus, my agent, whose assistant he is. To Trajan. Sempronius Cffilianus, a young man of remarkable merit, has sent me two slaves discovered among the re-* Letter 21, note. BOOK X. 343 emits. I have deferred their punishment in order to consult you, the restorer and establisher of military disci- pline, as to the nature of the penalty. My principal hesitation is on this account, that, though they had already pronounced the military oaths, they had not as yet been assigned to any corps.* I beg then, sir, you would write me word what course I should follow, particularly as this pertains to example. 30 (39)- Trajan to Pliny. Sempronius Cselianus has acted in accordance with my instructions in sending to you persons concerning whom it will be necessary to make inquiry whether they seem to have merited the extreme penalty. Now it is material whether they offered themselves as volunteers, or were chosen, or again were merely presented as substitutes. If they were chosen, the recruiting officers were in fault : if they were presented as substitutes, the blame is with those who so presented them : if they came spontaneously, with a knowledge of their condition, it will be proper to punish them. Nor is it of much consequence that they have not yet been assigned to a corps. For the very day they were passed, it was their duty to tell the truth about their origin. To Tkajan. Saving your majesty, sir, it behoves you to conde- scend to my difficulties, seeing that you have given me the right to refer to you in all matters of doubt. In many cities, and particularly Nicomedia and Nicsea, certain per- sons who had been condemned to the mines, or the arena, and similar kinds of punishment, exercise the office and ministry of public slaves, and even, in the capacity of * \" Sent to the colours,\" as we say. public slaves, receive annual wages. On hearing this, I hesitated much and long as to what I ought to do. For, on the one hand, to remit to their punishment, after a great lapse of time, men, most of whom are now in years and who are alleged to be leading honest and discreet lives, seemed to me to be too severe : on the other hand, to retain convicts in public employments appeared to me not quite respectable. Again, I judged that for these people to be supported by the commonwealth in idleness would be useless; and that if they were not supported, there would be actual danger. Perforce, therefore, I have left the whole matter in suspense, till I had consulted you. You will perhaps inquire how it came to pass that they were exempted from the punishments to which they had been condemned, and so did I inquire, but could get no positive information to lay before you. For though the decrees, by which they had been condemned, were produced, no documents were forthcoming to prove their having been let off. There were, however, some who said that they had obtained their dismissal by their prayers at the bidding of the Proconsuls or Legates. What imparts credit to this is, that it must be supposed no one would venture on such an act without authority. Trajan to Pliny. Ptemember that you were sent to the province in which you now are on this very account, that there was much in it which seemed to need rectifying. Now this will be a matter specially requiring correction, that those who have been condemned to punishments should not only have been released from them, as you write, without authority, but should even be removed into the cate- gory of respectable servants. Those, then, who have been condemned within the last ten years and have not been liberated by any competent authority, it will be proper to remit to their punishment : if there shall be found some older and aged persons who have been condemned more than ten years ago^w e must distribute them in such ofQces as are not far from being penal. For persons of this kind are usually assigned to the baths, the cleansing of the latrines, also to working on the roads and in the streets. To Trajan. While I was making a tour through the opposite side of the province, an immense conflagration at Nicomedia consumed a number of private houses and two public edificesthough separated by a roadthe Gerusia * and Temple of Isis. It spread the wider first through violence of the wind and next through the apathy of the inhabi- tants, who, it is quite clear, remained idle and motionless spectators of the sad calamity : and, independently of this, there was nowhere any fire-engine f for public use, no water-bucket, in short, no implement for keeping down conflagrations. As for these, indeed, in accordance with my orders already given, they will be provided. Do you, sir, consider whether you think a guild of firemen should be instituted, limited to one hundred and fifty men. I will see to it that no one shall be admitted except he be a fireman, and that they shall not use the rights accorded them for any other purpose. Nor will it be difficult to watch such a small number of men. Teajan to Pliny, It has come into your head, I see, in accordance with a common precedent, that a guild of firemen might be con-* It is disputed whether this was + 5ipo or Sipho.

But I bear in mind that that province of yours, and particularly those cities, are subject to trouble from associations of this description. Whatever name, for whatever reason, we give to these reunions they will shortly become . . . and secret societies. It is better, then, to procure what may be of assistance in restraining fires, and to admonish owners of property to be themselves ready to keep them down ; moreover, if the circumstances require it, to employ the concourse of spectators for the same object. To Trajan. We are at the same time, sir, renewing and acquitting our solemn vows for your safety, on which the public prosperity depends, praying the gods to grant that they may be ever thus acquitted and thus attested. TiiAJAN TO Pliny. I have learnt with pleasure, dearest Secundus, from your letter that, in company with the Provincials, you have both acquitted and renewed your vows for my health and safety to the immortal Gods. To Teajan. The inhabitants of Nicomedia, sir, spent three millions three hundred and twenty-nine thousand sesterces* on an aqueduct which was left still unfinished and was even demolished. Two millions of sesterces f have been disbursed afresh on another aqueduct. This, too, having been * About ;^26,7oo, if tlie reading be correct. + About ;/^r6,ooo. BOOK X. 347 left off, there is need of some further outlay, that those who have mischievously thrown away such large sums may have water at any rate. I have in person found my way to a spring of great purity, from which it seems that the water ought to be conducted to the spot (as was origi- nally attempted) by means of arches, so that it may not reach only to the flat and low-lying parts of the city. A very few arches still remain, and some may further be erected of the squared stones taken from the former con- struction ; some portions, as it seems to me, will have to be made of brickwork, which is both handier and cheaper. But, first of all, it is necessary that a conduit-master or architect should be sent, that what has taken place before may not happen again. All I can say is, that the utility and beauty of the construction will be in all respects worthy of your reign, 38 Tkajan to Pliny. Care must be taken that water be conducted to the city of Nicomedia. I have full confidence that you will ad- dress yourself to this work with all due diligence. But, by the God of Truth, it concerns that same diligence of yours to inquire by whose fault the inhabitants of Nico- media have thrown away so much money up to this time, and whether they have not been playing into each other's hands in commencing and then abandoning these aque- ducts. Accordingly, whatever you discover on this head, bring to my knowledge. To Trajan. The theatre of Nicsea, sir, which is now in great part constructed, though yet unfinished, has absorbed, as I hear (for the accounts for the building have not yet been gone into), more than ten millions of sesterces,* and I fear to no purpose. For it is subsiding and gaping with huge fissures, either by reason of the soil being wet and spongy, or because the stone itself is poor and friable. It cer- tainly deserves consideration whether it ought to be completed, or abandoned, or even demolished, for the props and substructions, by which it is from time to time kept up, seem to me to be sources of expenditure rather than of strength. Many additions are promised to this theatre by private individuals, as, for instance, galleries all round, and porticoes over the spectators' seats, all of which are now delayed, owing to the stoppage of the work which must first be completed. These same people of ISTicsea have begun to rebuild the gymnasium, which was destroyed by fire before my arrival, with many more parts and on a larger scale than before, and they have already gone to some expense ; as the dan- ger is, to small advantage, for it is ill-arranged and scat- tered. Moreover, an architect, a rival to be sure of the one by whom the work was commenced, afiirms that the walls, though two and twenty feet in thickness, are unable to support the weight imposed on them, in consequence of their being stuffed with cement in the middle and not encased in brickwork. The people of Claudiopolis, too, are excavating, rather than building, huge baths in a low situation, with a hill actually hanging over it ; and this, too, out of the moneys which the new members of their Council, added by your favour, have either already paid as their entrance-fees, or are paying in at our demand. Since, then, I fear that, in the one case, the public money, and, in the other, what is of more value than any money, the produce of your favour, may be badly invested, I am compelled to ask you, not only on account of the theatre, but also of these baths, to send an architect. He will judge whether it be more advantageous, after the outlay which has been in- * About ;,^8o,ooo. I BOOK X. ' 349 curred, to complete the works, in one way or another, as they have been begun, or to rectify what may seem to need improvement, and to transfer operations which may need to be transferred ; * lest, while we are desirous of not losing what has been spent, we spend badly what will have to be further added. 40 (49)- Trajan to Pliny, As to what is proper to be done in connection with the theatre, which has been commenced at Nicasa, you who are on the spot will be best able to consider and deter- mine. I shall be satisfied to have intimated to me the opinion at which you arrive. The parts of the work due from private individuals, you will take care to exact from them, then only when the theatre, on account of which they have been promised, is built. These Greeklings are addicted to gymnasia; so perhaps the people of Nicsea have set about building theirs with too much zest ; they must, however, be content with one which shall suffice for their necessities. As to the advice to be 'given to the people of Claudio- polis, in connection with their baths (which they have commenced in what you describe as an unsuitable spot), it is for you to determine. You cannot be short of architects. There is no province which does not contain expe- rienced and ingenious men of this kind; provided you do not suppose it is shorter to send them from Eome, when they are actually in the habit of coming to us from Greece. * This seems to refer to the baths. See ante. PLINY'S LETTERS. To Trajan. When I contemplate the grandeur of your fortunes and of your mind, it seems to me in the highest degree appro- priate to designate to you such works as shall be worthy no less of your immortality than of your glory, as shall be marked by their utility no less than by their excellence. On the borders of the Nicomedian territory there is an extensive lake, by means of which marble, agricultural produce, firewood, and building materials are conveyed, at small cost and labour, in ships to a road, and from that point with much labour, and still more expense, in waggons to the sea. . . . This work demands many hands, but these, to be sure, are not wanting, for there is a large supply of men in the country parts, and a still larger in the city, and we may confidently expect that all of them will with much alacrity engage in a work which will be of advantage to all. It remains for you, if you shall see fit, to send us a surveyor, or else an architect, who shall carefully exa- mine whether the lake is higher than the seathe experts in these parts contending that it is higher by forty cubits. I find that a trench was cut in this identical direction by the king;* but it is uncertain whether this was done for the purpose of collecting the moisture from the surrounding country, or in order to turn the lake into the river. For it is not completed. And this, too, is doubtful, whether the king was arrested by death, or whether he despaired of carrying through the work. But this very circumstance (for you will suffer me to be ambi- tious on account of your glory) incites and stimulates me to wish that you may complete that which kings have only commenced. * A rcge. Who is meant is uncer-in the portion of the letter which tain. Some suppose Mithridatea. seems to be wanting. See above. The \"river\" which is next alluded Cf. Letter 61. to may probably have been mentioned i BOOK X. 351 42(51). Teajan to Pliny. The lake which you mention is such as may possibly induce in us the desire to open it out to the sea. But a careful examination is evidently necessary, lest if its waters be sent down to the sea, they should be entirely drained off, and certainly as to the quantity of its waters and the source whence it derives them. You can ask for a surveyor from Calpurnius Macer, and I will send you from here some person experienced in this kind of work. To Trajan. On my calling for an account of the expenditure of the community of Byzantium (which has been very great), I learnt, sir, that an envoy is sent to pay his respects to you every year, bearer of a popular decree to that effect, and that twelve thousand sesterces* are given him. So, bear- ing in mind your course of action, I deemed it right to keep back the envoy and to send on the decree, that at the same time the expense might be lightened and a public duty fulfilled. The same city was debited with three thousand sesterces,-f-which, under the head of travelling expenses, were given annually to the envoy who went to pay his respects publicly to the Governor of Mcesia. These sums, I considered, ought for the future to be cut down. I beg, sir, that you would write me word what you think, and so deign either to confirm my judgment or to correct my mistake. 44 (53). Teajan to Pliny. You have acted admirably, dearest Secundus, in remit- ting to the inhabitants of Byzantium those twelve thousand * About ;^96. t About ^24, sesterces which were spent on an envoy for the purpose of paying me their respects . . . although the decree alone shall have been sent through you. The Governor of Moesia, too, will forgive them if they show their regard for him in a less expensive way. 45 (54). To Trajan. With regard to diplomas,* sir, the date of which has expired, I would beg you to write whether you wish them to be regarded at all, and if so for how long ? This will free me from doubt. For I fear that through ignorance I may make a mistake one way or the other, and either con- firm what is unlawful or obstruct what is necessary. 46(55). . Diplomas, the date of which has expired, ought not to be in force. Consequently I make it one of my first rules to send new diplomas to all the provinces before they can possibly be required. To Trajan. Upon my desiring, sir, to be made acquainted with the debts due to the State of Apamea, and its income and expenditure, I was told in reply that, while every one was anxious that the accounts of the colony should be inspected by me, yet that they never had been inspected by any of the pro-consuls, since they were in possession of a prero- gative and a very ancient usage of administering the public * Diplomata, letters of recom-here, though there were diplomata of mendation to persons travelling, various kinds, and we cannot be sure something like modern passports, as to what Pliny refers. This is probably at least the sense BOOK X. 353 affairs at their own discretion. I insisted upon all that they said and recited being included in a memorial, which I have sent to you just as I received it, though perceiving that much of its contents does not relate to tlie subject of inquiry. I beg you to deign to instruct me as to the course you deem it right for me to follow. For I fear lest I should seem either to have exceeded or not to have duly fulfilled the functions of my office. Teajan to Pliny. The memorial of the Apameni, which you have joined to your letter, has freed me from the necessity of carefully examining the reasons on the strength of which they wish it to appear that the Proconsuls who have governed their province have abstained from inspecting their accounts, since they have not opposed your inspecting them. Their probity should therefore be rewarded, and they should at once be told that in inspecting the accounts you will be acting by my orders, without prejudice to the prerogatives they enjoy. To Teajan. Before my arrival, sir, the inhabitants of Nicomedia had begun to add a new Forum to their old one, in a corner of which is a temple of the great mother of the gods,* which must be either rebuilt or removed, parti- cularly as it is much lower than the construction which is at the present moment rising. When I inquired whether the temple had been in any way formally con- secrated, I learnt that the mode of dedication here differs from ours. Consider, then, sir, whether you think that a temple which has not been formally consecrated can be * Cybele. removed without prejudice to religion. In other respects, it would be most convenient to do soif religion is no obstacle. Teajan to Pliny. You may, dearest Secundus, without religious scruples if the situation of the place seems to require itre- move the temple of the mother of the gods to one that is better accommodated to it. Nor need you be troubled about finding no form of dedication, since the soil of a foreign city does not admit of the kind of dedication which takes place under our laws. To Teajan. It is difficult, sir, to express in words the great pleasure which I felt at your consenting, at the request of my mother-in-law and myself, to transfer her relative Cselius Clemens to this province. For hence I thoroughly under- stand the measure of your kindness, since I experience such full favour, with all my kindreda favour I dare not attempt to make a like return for, even though I had it entirely in my power. So I fly to prayers, and entreat the gods that I may not be deemed unworthy of those things which you are so assiduous in conferring on me. To Teajan. \"We have celebrated, sir, the day on which you saved the Empire by taking it on yourself, with all the joy which you merit : and we prayed the gods to preserve you in life and prosperity to the human race whose safeguard and security depends on your welfare. We set the ex- ample to the troops, too, in swearing allegiance in the i BOOK X. 355 customary way, which the provincials did in the same form, and with emulous loyalty, 53 (6i). Trajan to Pliny. I have learnt with pleasure from your letter, my dearest Secundus, how religiously and joyfully the troops, to- gether with the provincials, followed you in celebrating the day of my accession. 54 (62). To Trajan. The public moneys, sir, are, through your forethought and our ministry, either already collected or in the course of collection ; and I fear they will lie idle. Por there are no opportunities, or else very rare ones, of buying land : nor are persons to be found who are willing to be debtors to the state, particularly at twelve per cent., the rate at which they can borrow from private individuals. Con- sider then, sir, whether you think that the rate of interest should be lowered, and by these means eligible borrowers be attracted, and if even thus such persons are not to be found, whether the money should be distributed among the Decurions, * on condition of their furnishing proper security to the state; which arrangementthough they may not like it, and may be for declining itwould be made less burdensome, in consequence of a lower rate of interest having been fixed. o 55 (63). Trajan to Pliny. I myself can perceive no other remedy, my dearest Secundus, than that the rate of interest should be lowered, in order to facilitate the investment of the public moneys. You yourself must fix the limit in accordance with the number of those who shall be ready to borrow. To compel persons against their will to take what they themselves may perhaps find no employment forthis is a course which does not accord with the equity of my reign. To Trajan. I return you, sir, the deepest thanks for deigning, amidst your great occupations, to direct me also as to those matters on which I have consulted you, and I would beg you to do this on the present occasion as well. Eor a person has come to me and informed me that his adver- saries, though banished for three years by that distin- guished man Servilius Calvus, still remain in the province. They, on the other hand, have affirmed that they were reinstated by the same governor, and have recited his edict to that effect. For this reason, I have thought it necessary to refer the matter in its entirety to you. For though it was provided in your mandates that I was not to reinstate persons banished by a former governor, or by myself, yet nothing was included in them on the subject of those who had been both banished and reinstated by a former governor. Therefore you, sir, had to be consulted as to what practice you would have me follow, as also, by Hercules, with regard to those who, though banished for life and never reinstated, are caught in the province. For this particular case too has fallen under my cognisance. A person was brought before me who was banished for life by Julius Bassus, the proconsul. Knowing that the acts of Bassus had been rescinded, and that the Senate had given to all those who had been the subjects of any of his decisions the right of trying the matter afresh, that is during a period of two years, I inquired of this person whom Bassus had banished, whether he had gone to the BOOK X. 357 proconsul and instructed him. He said he had not. Hence I was brought to consult you as to whether he should be remitted to his punishment or whether you think that some still heavier penalty, and if so what particular one, should be constituted for him and for those, if such there happen to be, who may be found in a like case. I have appended to this letter the decree of Calvus and the edict, also the decree of (Anon, n.d.) Tkajan to Pliny. As to the determination to be arrived at in the case of those persons who, having been banished for three years by P. Servilius Calvus, the proconsul, were soon after- wards reinstated by an edict of the same proconsul, and have remained in the province, I will shortly write you in reply, when I shall have inquired of Calvus himself liis reasons for thus acting. The man who was banished for life by Julius Bassusinasmuch as he had the power of taking action for the space of two years, in case he thought himself unjustly banished, and yet failed to do this, and moreover persisted in tarrying in the provincemust be sent a prisoner to my Praetorian prefects. For it is not enough that he should be remitted to his former punishment, after evading it by his contumacy. To Tkajan. On my summoning the judges, sir, when opening my provincial court. Flavins Archippus began to plead excuse on the ground of being a philosopher. It was said by some that instead of being freed from the obhgation of acting as judge, he ought to be removed altogether from the judicial list, and remitted to the punishment which he had escaped by breaking his chains. A decision of Velius Paulus, the proconsul, was cited, proving Archippus to have been condemned to the mines on a charge of forgery. He brought forward nothing to show that he had been reinstated ; he alleged, however, in favour of his reinstate- ment, a memorial presented by himself to Domitian, and \"\"etters of the latter in which he was honourably mentioned, ^s also as a decree of the Prusenses, To these he added a letter written to him by yourself too, and an edict and a letter of your father confirming the favours granted by Domitian. Consequently, though such crimes were laid to the charge of this man, I deemed that nothing should be decreed till I had consulted you on a point which seemed worthy of being settled by you. I have added to this letter what was cited on both sides. The Epistle of Domitian to Terentius Maximus. Flavins Archippus, the philosopher, has begged me to grant him, in the neighbourhood of Prusa, his native place, some land sufficiently productive to maintain his family by its revenue. I will that this be accorded him. The whole sum expended you will charge to my liberality. Of the same to L. Appius Maximus. I desire to recommend to you, my dear Maximus, Archippus the philosopher, a worthy man, and one whose conduct answers to his profession ; and that you show him the full measure of your kindness in such things as he shall ask of you in moderation. There are some things, Quirites, without doubt, which the felicity of these times spontaneously enjoins ; nor is the goodness of a prince to be tested, in matters in which it is sufficient that it be understood : since the assurance, needing no reminder, of my subjects, is a warrant to them, that I have preferred the general security to my own BOOK X. 359 repose, in order to confer many new favours, as well as to maintain those conceded before my time. In order, how- ever, that no uncertainty may be introduced into the public joy, either through the diffidence of those who have obtained favours or through the recollection of him who granted them, I have deemed it at the same time a necessity and a pleasure, with the view of meeting all suspicions, to announce my kindly intentions. I am un- willing any one should suppose that what he has obtained either privately or publicly from another prince will be annulled by me, though it were only with the view of his owing it to me rather than another. All these things are hereby settled and confirmed : nor are fresh prayers necessary to complete the enjoyment of any one on whom the imperial favour has smiled. Let my subjects suffer me to find leisure for fresh benefits, and let them know that those things only are to be asked for which they do not possess. Letter of the same to Tullius Justus. Inasmuch as all public ordinances which have received a commencement and completion in former reigns are to be observed, regard must also be paid to the letters of Domitian. To Trajan. Flavins Archippus has conjured me, \"by your health and immortality,\" to send you the memorial he has handed to me. I have thought it right to comply with a request so couched, on condition, however, of my informing the prosecutrix that I was going to send it. I got a memorial from her as well, and have appended it to these letters, that having, as it were, heard both sides, you might be in a better condition to judge what you think should be determined. 36o PLINY'S LETTERS. 60 (68). Teajan to Pliny. Domitian, to be sure, may have been ignorant of the situation of Archippus, when he wrote so much tending to his honour. But it is more in accordance with my nature to suppose that the intervention of the Emperor was actually for the purpose of relieving his situation, espe- cially as such an honour as that of a statue was so often decreed to him by persons who were not ignorant of the sentence passed on him by the Proconsul Paulus. All this, however, my dearest Secundus, must not go so far as to make you think you should be the slower to hear, in case anything in the shape of a fresh charge is brought against him. I have read the memorials of Puria Prima, the pro- secutrix, also those of Archippus himself, which you appended to your former letters. To Trajan. You, sir, to be sure, with your great forethought, are apprehensive that if the lake * be made to communicate with the river and so with the sea, it may be dried up. I, however, who am on the spot, fancy I have discovered a way of obviating this danger. The lake may be brought by means of a canal up to the river, and yet not be dis- charged into it, but be at the same time retained and kept separate from it, by leaving, as it were, a margin between the two. By this means we shall obtain as a result, that while the lake shall not seem to be emptied by being poured into the river, yet it will be as good as poured into it. For over this very small intermediate space it will be easy to transport to the river the cargoes brought to that point by means of the canal. The work will be so executed if necessity compels, though I hope it will not * See Letter 41 of this book. BOOK X. 361 compel. For not only is the lake sufficiently high of itself, but also at the present moment it discharges a river on the opposite side, which may be dammed off from that direction, and diverted as we wish, and so, without any loss to the lake, be made to give all the water which it now carries. Moreover, on the ground along which the canal will have to be made, rivulets occur which, if they are carefully collected, will add to what the lake gives us. If, again, it be decided to prolong the canal, to dig it narrower, and to bring it on a level with the sea, and so to make it communicate not with the river but with the sea itself, the counter-pressure of the sea will preserve and keep back whatever comes from the lake. If the nature of the locality allowed of nothing of this kind, yet it would be easy to check the rapidity of the stream by means of sluices. However, these and other matters will be inquired into and investigated with much more sagacity by the surveyor whom you, sir, ought clearly to send according to promise. For the matter is one worthy of your greatness and your attention, I meanwhile have written to that distinguished man, Calpurnius Macer, at your suggestion, to send me as competent a surveyor as possible. Trajan to Pliny. It is clear, my dearest Secundus, that you have been wanting neither in prudence nor in diligence in the matter of the lake of which you speak : since you have provided so many expedients, by means of which not only will there be no danger of its being exhausted, but also it will be made more serviceable to us. Choose, then, whatever the circumstances themselves shall particularly recommend. I take it that Calpurnius Macer will arrange to furnish you with a surveyor, nor are those provinces deficient in professionals of this kind. To Trajan. Lycormas, your freedman, has written me word, sir, that if any embassy came here from Bosphorus, on its way to Eome, it should be detained till his arrival, Now no embassy has as yet come, at any rate to the city in which I am : but a courier has come from the king of Sarmatia : and availing myself of the opportunity which chance offered, I have thought it right to send him on in company with the courier who preceded Lycormas, that you might be informed at the same time, by the letters of Lycormas and those of the king, of matters which perhaps ought to come to your knowledge at one and the same time. To Trajan. The king of Sarmatia has written me word that there are some matters on which you ought to be informed as soon as possible. For this reason I have helped to hasten the courier, whom he has sent to you with despatches, by the grant of a passport. To Teajan. A great question, sir, and one affecting the whole pro- vince, is that of the status and keep of those who are called \" foundlings.\" In this matter, after hearing the constitutions of the Emperors, as I could find nothing in them either of a particular or a general kind applicable to the Bithynians, I have judged it proper to consult you as to the course you would have pursued: nor, indeed, did I think that in a matter demanding your supreme judgment I could possibly be satisfied with a mere pre- BOOK X. 363 cedent. An edict was, however, cited to me, which was said to be one by the Emperor Augustus relating to Annia. Letters were also cited of the Emperor Vespasian to the LacedaBmonians, of the Emperor Titus to the same, and of Domitian to the proconsuls Avidius Nigrinus and Armenius Brocchus, also to the Lacedaemonians. These I have not sent to you, because they seemed to me to be mere rough drafts and some of them of doubtful authenticity, and because I believe the genuine and corrected letters to be among your archives. Tkajan to Pliny. This questionrelating to those who, born free, have been exposed, and have been subsequently taken up by certain parties and reared in servitudehas been often treated of ; yet there is nothing to be found in the commentaries of the Emperors who have preceded me, in the shape of a settled rule for all the provinces. There are, to be sure, letters of Domitian to Avidius Nigrinus and Armenius Brocchus, which, perhaps, ought to be had in regard, but between those provinces which are the subjects of his rescript . . . among which is Bithynia. I think, therefore, that an adjudication of freedom should not be refused to those who claim their liberty on these grounds,* and, moreover, that this same liberty does not need to be purchased at the price of their keep. To Teajan. The ambassador of the king of Sarmatia having, of his own choice, halted a couple of days at Nicaea, where he found me, I judged, sir, that he ought not to be detained longer : first, because it was still uncertain when your * Ex ejusmodi causa, or \"under these circumstances,\" \"in cases of this kind,\" as in Letter 68. PLINY'S LETTERS. freedman Lycormas would come, and next because I was myself starting for the other side of the province where the requirements of my office called me. I have thought these circumstances should be brought to your knowledge, because I recently wrote to you that Lycormas had asked me to detain till his arrival any embassy that might come from Bosphorus. No satisfactory reason occurs to me for doing this any longer, particularly as the letters of Lycor- mas (which I was unwilling, as I have before told you, to detain) seemed likely to precede this ambassador by some days. To Trajan. Certain parties have petitioned me to allow them, in accordance with the precedents of former governors, to transfer the ashes of their relations, either on account of the injuries done by time, or the encroachments of the river, or on a variety of other similar grounds. Knowing that at Rome, in cases of this kind, application is wont to be made to the Pontifical College, I have thought it right to consult you, sir, who are Pontifex Maximus, as to what course you would have me follow. Trajan to Pliny. It would be hard to inflict on the provincials the neces- sity of applying to the Pontifices, if they are desirous, on any good grounds, of transferring the ashes of their rela- tives from the place where these lie to some other. You should, therefore, rather follow the precedents of those who have governed that province : and give the permis- sion, or refuse it in each case, according to the merits. BOOK X. 365 70 (75). To TllAJAN. On my inquiring, sir, whereabouts in Prusa the hatha which you have accorded could be built, I pitched upon a spot where there was once, I am told, a fine house, now an unsightly ruin. In this way we shall insure that the extremely filthy aspect of the city will be improved, and even that the city itself will be enlarged, without any buildings being pulled down, but such as are crumbling with age being rebuilt on a larger and improved scale. The circumstances of this house, however, are as follows. Claudius Polysenus left it by will to Claudius Caesar, with the injunction that a temple should be raised to him in the peristyle, and the rest of the house should be let. For some time the commonwealth derived a revenue from it : afterwards, by degrees, partly through plunder, partly through neglect, the whole house has tumbled to pieces, peristyle included : and indeed by this time hardly any- thing of it remains but the ground on which it stood. If you, sir, would either make a present of this ground to the state, or order it to be sold, the act would be received as a great boon, on account of the eligibility of the site. For my part, if you will allow me, I design to place the baths where the open court was, and to enclose the place where the buildings were with a vestibule and colonnades to be dedicated to you, the benefactor to whom will be owing this handsome construction, worthy of your name. I have forwarded you a copy, though it is an imperfect one, of the will. From this you will see that Polysenus left many things for the adornment of this same house, which have disappeared with the house itself. However, I will make as diligent inquiry as possible for them. than plebeians. Having been asked for my opinion by the Censors elect, I thought that those under thirty years of age who had held office might be chosen senators, in accordance both with the edict of Augustus and the law of Pompey : inasmuch as Augustus had allowed persons under thirty to hold office, and the law enacted that he who had held office should be a senator. As to such as had not held it, although of the same age as those who had been allowed to hold it, I hesitated. Hence I have been brought to consult you, sir, as to what course you would have followed, I have appended to this edict the heads of the law, also the edict of Augustus. Teajan to Pliny. I agree with you, dearest Secundus, in your interpretation, that Pompey's law has been amended by the Emperor Augustus's edict so far as this, that persons can be admitted to public offices, who are not under twenty- two years of age, and that such as had been so admitted should find their way into the Senate of each common- wealth. But, where no office has been entered on, I do not think that those who are under thirty years are cap- able of being chosen senators in their several localities, on the ground that they are eligible for such offices. To Teajan. While I was employed in public business in my own apartments at Prusa under Mount Olympus, sir, being about to leave the same day, Asclepiades, a magistrate, announced that an appeal had been lodged with me by Claudius Eumolpus. Coccianus Dion having moved in the Council that a construction which he had had the charge of should be assigned to the city, thereupon BOOK X. ^^Ê umolpus, backed by Flavins Arcliippus, declared that Dion should be required to furnish the accounts relatino- to the construction before it was handed over to the city, on the ground of his not having acted as he ought to have done. He added, moreover, that in this same construction there were placed, together with your statue, the corpses of interred personsthose of Dion's wife and son ; and he demanded that I should try the matter publicly.* Upon my telling him that I would immediately do this, and would adjourn my departure accordingly, he asked me to grant a longer interval for the purpose of getting up the case, and to try it in some other city. I replied that I would hear it at Mcsea. When I had taken my seat there for the purpose of trying it, the same Eumolpus, on the plea of not yet being sufficiently prepared, began by asking for an adjournment : Dion, on the other hand, demanded that it should be heard. A great deal was said on both sides, and on the merits of the case as well. Tor my part, being of opinion that an adjournment should be granted, and counsel taken of you in a matter likely to form a pre- cedent, I told each side to give in a written statement of their respective demands, for I desired that you should know what was put forward, above all things, in the very words of the parties themselves. Dion said he would give this in, and Eumolpus replied that he would include in a written statement his claims on behalf of the commonwealth ; but that as regarded the interred bodies, he was not the accuser, but only the advocate of Elavius Archippus, whose instructions he had obeyed. Arcliippus, however, who stood by Eumolpus here as at Prusa, said that he would hand in a statement. Such being the case, neither Eumolpus nor Archipjius, though waited for for many days, have as yet sent me their statements. Dion has sent his, which I have joined to this letter. I myself went to the spot, and saw that your statue was added to To Teajan. Nymphidius Lupus, sir, a former Primipilus,* was my comrade in arms at the time when I myself was Tribune and he was Praefect. From that time I began to cherish him closely. Subsequently my regard for him grew from the very length of our mutual friendship. On the strength of this, I have laid violent hands on his repose, and have forced him to assist me with his counsel in Bithynia. This he has not only already done, but will continue to do in the most friendly way, and laying aside all considerations of ease and age. For these reasons I reckon his belongings among my own, and particularly his son Nymphidius Lupus, a young man of probity and energy, one in every way worthy of his distinguished father, and who will do credit to your indulgent notice of him. This indeed you may learn from the first proofs he has given as Prajfect of a cohort, in which capacity he gained the highest character from those eminent men, Julius Perox and Fuscus Sali- nator. My joy and self-congratulation will be satisfied by the advancement of the son. To Teajan. I pray, sir, that you may have the happiest of birthdays, and many others like it, and that in strength and security you may ever be adding by fresh achievements to that glory flourishing with immortal renown, which you derive from your virtues. * The Primipilus was a centuriou sise the fact that Nymphidius Lupus of high rank, who carried the eagle had filled the responsible office of of the legion. Those who had served Primipilus before rising to the higher the office were styled Primipilares. grade of Prcefectus. Here Pliny probably wishes to enipha- BOOK X. 375 89 (90). Teajan to Pliny. I acknowledge with thanks, dearest Secundus, the prayers you offer that I may have many birthdays, and very happy ones, with our country in a flourishing condition. To Teajan. The inhabitants of Sinope, sir, are short of water, which it seems might be brought in, of good quality and in abundance, from a distance of sixteen miles. There is, however, close upon the source, that is a little more than a mile off, a suspicious and boggy spot : this I have meanwhile ordered to be examined, at a small expense, to see whether it is capable of receiving and supporting an aque- duct. We shall not want for money, which I have taken care to collect, provided you, sir, accord this kind of con- struction in view of the salubrity and attractiveness of a very thirsty town. 91 (92). Trajan to Pliny. As you have begun, dearest Secundus, so go on care- fully to investigate whether the particular spot, which is suspicious to you, can bear such a work as an aqueduct, Por I do not doubt that water should be brought into the town of Sinope, provided the town itself can effect this at its own charge only : since such a result would add much both to its salubrity and to its agreeableness. To Teajan. The free and confederate city of the Amiseni, by favour of your indulgence, enjoys its own laws. A petition was handed to me there relatincc to \" Charitable Collections,\" which I have appended to this letter, that you, sir, might judge what things (and how far things of this kind) should be either allowed or prohibited. Teajax to Pliny. As to the Amiseni, whose petition you have appended to your letter: if by their laws (which they enjoy in virtue of their confederation with us) it is permitted them to have charitable collections, we cannot prevent their doing so : and all the less, if they employ contributions of this kind, not in assembling crowds and illegal gatherings, but in aiding the needs of the indigent. In the other cities which are bound by our laws, things of this kind must be prohibited. To Teajan. Suetonius Tranquillus, sir, is a most upright, honour- able, and learned man. Having long been attracted by his character and studious pursuits, I have admitted him to my intimacy, and the more closely I have observed him, the more have I begun to cherish him. The rights enjoyed by those who have three children * are rendered a necessity to him for two reasons. His deserts often obtain for him a mention in his friends' wills, and at the same time his marriage has not turned out fruitful.t It is from your bounty that he must obtain, through my intercession, what the malignity of Fortune has refused him. I know, sir, how great is the favour which I ask. But it is of you that I am asking it, you whose indulgence * See ii. 13. incapable of taking bequests in their \"Y By the Lex Papia Poppsea, mar-entirety, a portion going, as we should ried persons, without children, were term it, \"to the Crown.\" BOOK X. I experience in all iny requests. Yon may, moreover, gather how ardent must be my desire in a matter which I should not ask you for, when absent fromt^you, if that dffisire were merely of an ordinary character. lOâ d>) 95 (96). TiiAJAN TO Pliny, How sparing I am in bestowing such favours as these you must certainly remember, my dearest Secundus, see- ing that I often declare in the Senate itself that I have not gone beyond the number of favoured persons which, in the presence of that illustrious assembly, I promised should suffice me. However, I have subscribed to your wishes, and have ordered it to be entered on my registers, that I have accorded to Suetonius Tranquillus the rights of those who have three children, on the usual conditions. To Tkajan, It is with me, sir, an established custom to refer to you all matters on which I am in doubt. Who, indeed, is better able, either to direct my scruples or to instruct my imorance ? I have never been present at trials of Christians, and consequently do not know for what reasons, or how far, punishment is usually inflicted or inquiry made in their case, Nor have my hesitations been slight : as to whether any distinction of age should be made, or persons however tender in years should be viewed as differing in no respect from the full-grown : whether pardon should be accorded to repentance, or he who has once been a Christian should gain nothing by having ceased to be one : whether the very profession itself if unattended by crime, or else the crimes necessarily attaching to the profession, should be made the subject of punishment. Meanwhile, in, the case of those who have been broug ht before me in the character of Christians, my course has been as folJ.ws: -I put it to themselves whether thjy were or we' not Christians. To such as professed tlJat they we;^^put the inquiry a second and a third time, X _ \\ ^them with the supreme penalty. Those who •persisted, I ordered to execution. For, indeed, I could not doubt, whatever might be the nature of that which they professed, that their pertinacity, at any rate, and inflexible obstinacy, ought to be punished. There were others afflicted with like madness, with regard to whom, as they were Eoman citizens, I made a memorandum that they were to be sent for judgment to Eome. / Soon, the very handling of this matter causing, as often happens, the area of the charge to spread, many fresh examples occurred. An anonymous paper was put forth containing the names of many persons. Those who denied that they either were or had been Christians, upon their calling on the gods after me, and upon their offering wine and in- cense before your statue, which for this purpose I had ordered to be introduced in company with the images of the gods, moreover upon their reviling Christnone of which things it is said can such as are really and truly (Christians be compelled to dothese I deemed it proper t|o dismiss. Others named by the informer admitted that tney were Christians, and then shortly afterwards denied ic>.adding that they had been Christians, but had ceased to be so, some three years, some many years, more than one of them as much as twenty years, before. All these, too, not only honoured your image and the effigies of the gods, but also reviled Christ. They affirmed, however, that this had been the sum, whether of their crime or their delusion ; they had been in the habit of meeting together on a stated day, before sunrise, and of offering in turns a form of invocation to Christ, as to a god ; also of binding themselves by an oath, not for any guilty purpose, but not to commit thefts, or robberies, or adulteries, not BOOK X. 379 to break their word, not to repudiate deposits when called upon ; these ceremonies having been gone through, they had been in the habit of separating, and again meeting together for the purpose of taking foodfood, that is, of an ordinary and innocent kind. They had, however, ceased from doing even this, after my edict, in which, following your orders, I had forbidden the existence of Fraternities. This made me think it all the more neces- sary to inquire, even by torture, of two maid-servants, who were styled deaconesses, what the truth was. I could discover nothing else than a vicious and extrava- gant superstition : consequently, having adjourned the inquiry, I have had recourse to your counsels. Indeed, the matter seemed to me a proper one for consultation, chiefly on account of the number of persons imperilled. For many of all ages and all ranks, ay, and of both sexes, are being called, and will be called, into danger. Nor are cities only permeated by the contagion of this super- stition, but villages and country parts as well ; ' yet it seems possible to stop it and cure it. It is in truth sufficiently evident that the temples, which were almost entirely deserted, have begun to be frequented, that the customary religious rites which had long been interrupted are being; resumed, and that there is a sale for the food of sacrificial beasts, for which hitherto very few buyers in- deed could be found. From all this it is easy to form an opinion as to the great number of persons who may be reclaimed, if only room be granted for penitence. Trajan to Pliny. You have followed the right mode of procedure, my dear Secundus, in investigating the cases of those who had been brought before you as Christians. For, indeed, it is not possible to establish any universal rule, possess- ing as it were a fixed form. These people should not be 38o PLINY'S LETTERS. searched for ; if tliey are informed against and convicted they should be punished ; yet, so that he who shall deny being a Christian, and shall make this plain in action, that is by worshipping our gods, even though suspected on account of his past conduct, shall obtain pardon by his penitence. Anonymous informations, however, ought not to be allowed a standing in any kind of charge ; a course which would not only form the worst of precedents, but which is not in accordance with the spirit of our time. To Tkajan. The city of Amastris, sir, which is handsome and tastefully built, possesses among its finest constructions a very beautiful and at the same time very long boulevard, all along one side of which runs what indeed is called, a river, but is in reality a very foul sewer, hideous with its filthy aspect, and equally pestilent from its disgusting odour. For this reason it is a concern of salubrity no less than of appearance, that it should be covered up. This shall be done, with your permission, on our undertaking that money too shall not be wanting for the execution of a work as important as it is necessary. Tkajan to Pliny. It stands to reason, my dearest Secundus, that the water in question which flows through the city of Amastris should be covered up, if in its uncovered state it is in- jurious to health. As to money not failing for the work, that I am confident you will see to with your customary diligence. BOOK X. 381 100 (lOl). To Tkajan. We have acquitted ourselves, sir, witli joy and alacrity of the vows offered up last year, and have taken on our- selves fresh ones, troops and provincials vying with each other in loyal affection. We have prayed the gods to preserve you and the commonwealth in prosperity and safety, with all the favour whichin addition to your other great and numerous virtuesyou have merited by your exemplary piety, submission, and godliness. loi (102). Teajan to Pliny. I have been pleased to learn from your letter, my dearest Secundus, that troops and provincials have, with most cheerful consent, acquitted themselves of their vows for my safety to the immortal gods, yourself leading the way, and that they have offered fresh vows for the future. To Teajan. We have celebrated, with due rites, the day on which the guardianship of the human race was transferred to you, by a most happy succession ; commending to the gods, the ordainers of your rule, our public vows and our joys. 103 (104). Teajan to Pliny. To Teajan. Valerius Paulinus, sir, has bequeathed to me the patronage of his freedmen, to the exclusion of Paulinus. Of these, I pray you to grant the Eoman citizenship to three for the present ; for I fear it would be exceeding the bounds to invoke your favour on behalf of all of them at the same time ; a favour which it behoves me to be all the more modest in availing myself of, in proportion to the great fulness in which I experience it. These, how^ever, for whom I am applying are, C. Valerius Astrseus, C. Valerius Dionysius, and C. Valerius Axer. Teajan to Pliny. It is most generous on your part to seek the speedy advantage, through my agency, of those who have been confided to your honour by Valerius Paulinus ; accordingly, I have ordered an entry to be made in my registers to the effect that I have granted the Eoman citizenship to those, for the present, for whom you have now asked it ; and will do the same for others on behalf of whom you shall hereafter ask it. 106 (107). To Teajan. Having been requested, sir, by P. Accius Aquila, a centurion of the Sixth Cavalry Cohort,* to forward you * i.e., z. mixed cohort of cavalry and infantry. BOOK X. 383 a memorial, in which he implores your favourable con- sideration of his daughter's status, I thought it hard to refuse him, knowing as I do the great patience and kindliness which you exhibit towards the prayers of soldiers. Teajan to Pliny. I have read the memorial of P. Accius Aquila, a centurion in the Sixth Cavalry Cohort, which you forwarded to me, and, moved by his prayers, I have granted the Eoman citizenship to his daughter. I have forwarded to you a certificate of the rescript,* for you to hand to him. To Teajan. I should be obliged, sir, by your writing me word as to the rights you would wish the cities of Bithynia and Pontus to enjoy, in respect to calling in moneys owing to them either in the shape of rent, or for sales of property, or for any other reason. For my part, I have found that a preference over other creditors has been accorded them by most of the proconsuls, and has obtained the force of law. I am of opinion, however, that some rule should be established, and ratified by your wisdom, of a kind to conduce to their permanent interests. Eor as for what has been instituted by others, wise as such grants may have been, yet they are but temporary, and wanting in stability, unless they should enjoy the advantage of your authorisation. Tkajan to Pliny. As to the rights which the cities of Bithynia and Pontus should enjoy in the matter of moneys which shall be owing, on any account, to the commonwealth, this must be looked to, according to the laws of each city. For in case it possesses a privilege in virtue of which it is preferred to the remaining creditors, then that privilege must be observed ; in case it does not possess it, it will not be proper that it should be granted by me, to the detriment of private individuals. no (in). To Tkajan. The Syndic of the city of Amisus, sir, has sued Julius Piso before me for a sum of about forty thousand denarii,* a public grant made to him twenty years ago, with the consent of the Senate and assembled Commons : citing your ordinances by which donations of this kind are for- bidden. Piso, in reply, said that he had contributed large sums, and, indeed, spent nearly the whole of his means, on behalf of the commonwealth. He pleaded further the lapse of time, and begged that he might not be forced to give back, to the ruin of his remaining fortunes, that which he had received in return for many services, and a long while ago. Upon this I have thought it right to adjourn the whole case, in order to consult you, sir, as to the course you would have pursued. Although my ordinances forbid the making of largesses on public account, yet, to prevent the security of many * The denarius was worth about 8|d. BOOK X. 385 persons from being undermined, when these have been made some time ago, it is not expedient that they should be reconsidered and their invalidity established. Whatever, then, shall have been done not less tlian twenty years before, in this case, must be passed over. For I desire to have regard for the individuals of each place, no less than the public moneys. 112(113). To Tkajan. By the law of Pompey, sir, by which the inhabitants of Bithynia and Pontus are governed, such persons as are chosen into the council by the censors are not ordered to pay any fee. Those, however, whom your favour has per- mitted certain of the cities to add over and above the lawful number, have contributed sometimes a thousand, sometimes two thousand, denarii apiece.* Upon this, the proconsul, Anicius Maximus, ordered such likewise as were chosen by the censors (that is to say, in a small number of cities) to pay fees of various amounts. It remains for you yourself to consider whether in all the cities all persons who shall hereafter be chosen councillors ought not to pay some fixed sum as an entrance fee ; for it becomes you to make a permanent settlement, whose words and deeds immortality awaits. Teajan to Pliny, It is impossible for me to lay down a general rule as to whether all persons who in every city of Bithynia are created councillors f should, or should not, furnish an honorarium on their admission to the councilship. I think, thenand this is always the safest course -that the law of each city should be followed. , . . To Trajan. By the law of Ponipey, sir, it is permitted to the cities of Bithynia to enroll among their citizens any persons they please, provided they are not of any of the other cities in Bithynia. In the same law are enacted the grounds on which persons may be ejected from the Senate by the censors. Upon this, certain of the censors thought it right to consult me as to whether they ought to eject one who was from another city. Inasmuch as the law, though forbidding the enrolment of one from another city, yet did not order that this should be a ground of ejection from the Senate ; moreover, since I was assured that in every city there were a number of councillors from other cities, and that much disturbance would be caused to many individuals and to many cities, . . . that part of the law which had long since become obsolete through a kind of general consent, ... I have thought it necessary to consult you as to what you would have observed. I have appended to this letter the principal clauses of the law. Trajan to Pliny. !N\"o wonder you were in doubt, dearest Secundus, as to the proper reply for you to make to the censors who consulted you. . . . For the authority of the law on the one hand, and, on the other, the long usage which has obtained in opposition to the law, might well move you in opposite directions. I have decided upon thus compromising the matter : that we make no change in what is past, but that the citizens who have been naturalised, though illegally, of BOOK X. 387 whatever city they be, shall remain where they are ; for the future, however, that Pompey's law be observed. If we were for maintaining its provisions retrospectively as well, much disturbance would necessarily follow. To Trajan. Persons who attain their majority, or contract a mar- riage, or enter on a public office, or inaugurate a public work, are in the habit of inviting the whole of the council, and even a considerable number of the population, and presenting them with a couple of denarii,* and sometimes one, per man. I should be obliged by your writing me word whether you think these celebrations should be per- mitted, and if so, how far. For my part, although I am of opinion that the right to issue invitations should be conceded, especially on solemn occasions, yet at the same time I fear that those who invite a thousand individuals, and sometimes even more, may seem to exceed the bounds, and to fall into an appearance of distributing largesses. Trajan to Pliny. No wonder you are afraid that an invitation \" should fall into an appearance of distributing largesses,\" which not only exceeds the bounds in point of numbers, but also collects together to a ceremonious dole people in bands, so to speak, not man by man, each one on grounds of personal acquaintance. But I have made choice of your intelligence on this very account, that in forming the manners of that province of yours you should yourself ordain and establish what may be of advantage to the permanent quiet of the province. * The denarius was worth about eightpence-halfpeDny. To Tkajan. The athletes, sir, consider that the rewards which you have established in the case of the Iselastic * contests are owing to them from the very day on which they were crowned; for they say it is not at all material at what time they made their public entry into their native place, but at what time they were victors in the contest, by reason of which they were empowered to make such entry. I, on the other hand, observe that they have been given under the name of \" Iselastic ; \" and this makes me strongly inclined to doubt whether it be not rather the time of their making their public entry which must be looked at. These same persons ask for pensions in the case of a contest, which has been made an Iselastic one by you, though they should have been victors before it was so made. For they say it is only consistent that just as this money is not given them for those contests which have ceased to be Iselastic after th6ir victory, so it should be given to them for those which have begun to be Iselastic after their victory. Here, too, I am in no small doubt whether one can take account of what is past, and whether anything should be given them which was not owing to them at the time when they were victors. I pray you, then, to deign to determine my doubts, that is to say, to interpret your own benefactions. TeaJAN TO Pliny. The Iselastic rewards ought, it seems to me, to begin * Contests in public games, the a public entry into his city, from victor in which was entitled to make etVeXai/rw, to enter, drive in. BOOK X. 389 from the time when a man has made his personal entry into his own city. Pensions for those contests which I have been pleased to make Iselastic, in case they were not Iselastic before, are not due retrospectively. Nor can it avail in view of the athletes' request, that they ceased to receive these monies for those contests which subsequently to their victory I decided should not be Iselastic. For though the character of these contests was changed, never- theless what these people had previously received is not asked for back again. \"O\" 120 (121). To Trajan. Up to this time, sir, I have never accommodated any- body witli a passport, or issued one for any other service than your own. A kind of necessity has broken through this constant practice of mine. For my wife having heard of the death of her grandfather, and being desirous of setting off to lier aunt's, I thought it hard to deny her the use of a passport, seeing that the whole grace of such an attention consisted in its expedition, and that I knew I could give good reason for a journey the motive of which was family affection. This I liave written to you, because it seemed to me that I should be deficient in gratitude if I concealed the fact of my being indebted to your kind- ness, among other favours, for this one. I mean, that my confidence in your kindness has caused me not to hesitate in doing, without consulting you, what if 1 had consulted you, would have been done too late. have been done too late if you had consulted me as to whether your wife's journey should be aided by passports such as I have authorised you to issue, particularly as your wife was bound, in the case of her aunt, to enhance the grace of her arrival by her expedition. * Frisco Italia interdictum.

NOTES 183 89. The dichotomy between \"recreational\" and \"utilitarian\" in Roman engineering is in some ways parallel to that between \"sterile\" and \"practical\" in Roman agriculture. In fact the advanced technology of Roman hydraulics-and the same can be said of agricultural processing techniques-straddles the divide: it is expensive and learned and spectacular as well as being useful and functional, but it also bridges the gap between town and country. Vats and tanks are the common paraphernalia of the uban officina and the villa; hydraulic wizardry is the sign of the privileged city and the prestigious country estate. For a splendid example of show hydraulics in a setting of pastio villatica, we may note A.M.McCann, The Roman port and fishery of Cosa (Princeton, NJ, 1987), pp. 98-128 (the Spring House at the Portus Cosanus); this is also the context of the famous epigram (Anth. Pal. 9.418) on the waterwheel, not the paradoxical connecting of industrial banality and high poetry that it can seem to us: cf. also Strabo, 12.3.30 (King Mithridates).

The idea of the city and the excavations at Pompeii O what a great adventure of our times that we discover not just another ancient monument but a city. (Maffei, 1990) Scippione Maffei, 1748 Introduction \"The ancients\", Moses Finley tells us, \"were firm in their view that civilized life was thinkable only in and because of cities.\" To the ancients a city \"must be more than a mere conglomeration of people; there are necessary conditions of architecture and amenity\". (Finley, 1983) The discovery and excavation of the two buried ancient cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii in the 18th century offered, for the first time since antiquity, a glimpse into just those \"conditions of architecture and amenity\" referred to by Finley-that is to say, into the physical structure of the ancient city, (Anon, n.d.) with its walls, streets, tombs, public and private buildings. It is all the more surprising therefore that it took half a century after the identification of Pompeii in 1763 (digging had been in progress since 1748), (Corti, 1951) for Pompeii to be published as a city in François Mazois's (1783-1826) (Anon, n.d.) magnificent Les ruines de Pompéi, published from 1812 onwards. (Anon, n.d.) At Pompeii, wrote the authors of a work claiming 7 to be the first in English to describe the ruins (Sir William Gell and John Gandy's Pompeiana, of 1817-19), \"in the mind of the liberal antiquary the loneliness of the ruins may be animated by learned recollection\". It is a sense of that \"civilized life…thinkable only in and because of cities\", noted by Finley, that Mazois, Gell and Gandy seek to recreate. \"Animation\" of the ruins by \"learned recollection\" is suggested, for instance, by the frontispiece to Pompeiana (Fig. 10.1), \"wholly compiled from paintings and bronzes found at Pompeii\". (Anon, n.d.) An image is created through the combination of the artefacts of everyday life, the chairs, the tables, the lamps, the paintings, the marbles, with \"pavements and distant buildings\". 9 Images from different sources are composed, rather in the manner of 20th century collage, to create a new composite image. The second volume of Mazois's work, Habitations (published in 1824), has a similarly composed frontispiece (Fig. 10.2): The disposition of the door, the inscription, the mosaic threshold can be seen in several dwellings. The Pilasters and the capitals belong to house no.27, (Anon, n.d.) the entablature and the stucco which decorate it, the paintings which ornament the interior frieze, the portico at the end and several other details are taken from various buildings. The fountain can be seen in house no.46, called L'Actéon; (Anon, n.d.) the motif of the garden which completes the tableau was given to me by a painting existing in the same place; the two herms are kept at the Musée des Études at Naples; in short all the elements of this composition are antique, and the arrangement in which I offer them gives an exact view of the entry into one of the principal houses of Pompeii. 12 The tradition of compositions and vignettes drawn from the elements of Pompeii continued. In 1851, for instance, Jules Bouchet (1799-1860) published a book of such Compositions antiques freely modelled on Pompeii. It is the making, the transmission, and the absorption of such images of ancient city life into the modern world that is the subject of this essay. These images combine, on the one hand, \"the figure reading a volume, the chair upon which she sits, the footstool…manuscripts at her feet…marble table\", 13 with, on the other hand, Pausanius' \"government offices, …gymnasium, …market-place, …water descending to a fountain\" 14 -linking the world of the individual with that of the community, the microcosm represented by the house with the macrocosm represented by the city. (Anon, n.d.) Vitruvius \"To the ancients\", writes Moses Finley, \"the urban underpinning of civilization\" 16 was self-evident. When one turns to the only ancient exposition of the discipline of architecture that has survived, Vitruvius' De architectura, it is indeed the idea of the building of a city that underpins the structure of the book. For Vitruvius the art of building is the art of building the city-his exposition proceeds from the choice of site (1.4), to the building of the city walls (1.5), to the laying out of the broad streets and the alleys (1.6.1), and continues with the division into building plots: After apportioning the alleys and settling the main streets the choice of sites for the convenience and common use of the citizens has to be explained; for sacred buildings, the forum and the other public places. (1.7.1) (Anon, n.d.) After the public buildings, he moves to the private ones and then to a discussion (an opinionated one, it will be recalled: 7.5.3-4) of wall-paintings, showing for instance, \"the battles of Troy and the wanderings of Ulysses over the countryside\" (7.5.2). In other words, the work of Vitruvius' architect ranged over every aspect of the city-from the choice (and defence) of the site to landscape painting in the cubiculum of a private house. Of the ancient works on architecture that we know 18 to have been written, the sole survival of Vitruvius' De architectura into the Renaissance gave that work an extraordinary, perhaps undeserved, influence. The idea, though, that architecture is structured as a discipline by a hierarchy of tasks involved in the building of a city is one that remained pivotal. The two key architectural treatises of the quattrocento and the cinquecento, those of Leon Battista Alberti (1404-72) and Andrea Palladio (1508-80), both depend upon it. Alberti's De re aedificatoria 19 reveals a critical study of Vitruvius: For I grieved that so many works of such brilliant writers had been destroyed by the hostility of time and of man, and that almost the sole survivor from this vast shipwreck is Vitruvius, an author of unquestioned experience, though one whose writings have been so corrupted by time that there are many omissions and many shortcomings. (6.1) Alberti's treatise sets out to provide what Vitruvius lacks. The result, abstract and analytical compared to Vitruvius, has as its starting point patterns of association in the family and in society: In the beginning, men sought a place of rest in some region safe from danger; having found a place both suitable and agreeable, they settled down and took possession of the site. Not wishing to have all their household and private affairs conducted in the same place, they set aside one space for sleeping, another for the hearth, and allocated other spaces for different uses. After this [my emphasis] men began to consider…shelter from the sun and rain. (1.2) For Alberti the art of building consists of six things: \"(1) locality, (2) area [the site], (3) compartition, (4) wall, (5) roof, and (6) openings\" (1.2). In this sequence \"compartition\", the division into public and private, is the more fundamental operation than the provision of shelter. It is the primacy of the social operation of architecture that defines it, for Alberti, as the building of the city-and analogously the house: If (as the philosophers maintain) the city is like some large house, and the house some large city, cannot the various parts of the house…be considered miniature buildings? (1.9) (Anon, n.d.) Both Alberti and Palladio acknowledge dual sources for their work: Vitruvius and the ancient ruins. (Anon, n.d.) Palladio in turn is deeply indebted to Alberti, (Anon, n.d.) but what distinguishes Palladio's Quattro libri is its dependence on the visual image. The aim of the Quattro libri is, Palladio tells us: to publish the designs of those [ancient] edifices, (in collecting which, I have employed so much time, and exposed myself to so many dangers)… and…those rules which I have observed…that they who shall read these my books, may be able to make use of whatever may be good therein…, (Anon, n.d.) When, as he must in a complete presentation of architecture through the context of the city, Palladio turns (in book II) to the description and illustration of building for individuals, the town houses and country villas, he tells us: as we have but very few examples from the ancients, of which we can make use, I shall insert the plans and elevations of many fabrics I have erected…[as well as] the designs of ancient houses, in the manner that Vitruvius shews us they were made. (Anon, n.d.) At this critical point in his book, then, Palladio has no ancient houses to illustrate. Instead he must fall back, first, on his attempts to reconstruct, from Vitruvius' written description, what an ancient house might have looked like, then presenting images of houses that he himself had built. It is perhaps not surprising that there is a resemblance between Palladio's version of the ancient house and contemporary work. Vitruvius' ancient house is reconstructed in the classicizing language of Palladio's own practice; past and present are elided in a passion to represent the ancient city. François Mazois clearly understood this aspect of Palladio: The descriptions which Vitruvius and Varro…have given of the atrium become extremely clear once one has seen ancient houses, but before any had been discovered it was difficult to understand these authors. However, Palladio had guessed the form of the atrium, and applied it to modern buildings so ingeniously, that it must be regarded in some ways as a new invention. (Anon, n.d.) After 1748-or more importantly perhaps, when the excavations at Pompeii had been adequately published-such misprision was no longer possible. Excavations reached their first peak during the French occupation of Naples in the period between 1806 and 1815, (Anon, n.d.) and it was as a result of this work that Mazois's book, presenting the city as a whole, became possible. The earlier publication of Herculaneum, the Antichità d'Ercolano (8 vols, 1757-92), had, like the early excavations themselves, focused on the movable objects, the paintings, sculptures, bronzes, candelabra (all this, of course, having its influence: Ferdinando Bologna has described the volumes as \"models for the very modern production of ornaments and tools.\"). (Anon, n.d.) In contrast to the impact of the 18th century discovery and measurement of ancient Greek buildings which led, at first, only to the construction of delicately scaled garden temples, in the manner of the Hephaisteion, the Tower of the Winds or the Arch of Hadrian, 28 the discovery of Herculaneum and Pompeii created a fascination for their objects and interior decoration; motifs were simply grafted onto existing types. (Anon, n.d.) (The study of Greek architecture was of course to develop through the 19th century; by 1830 and Schinkel's Altes Museum we see Greek architecture so thoroughly absorbed and interpreted that it is becomes, as Palladio's ancient house, almost re-invented.) (Anon, n.d.) Mazois's aim in publishing Les ruines…is clear. It is to replace partial with complete publication: Les monuments de Pompéi ne sont encore connus que par l'ouvrage de l'Académie de Naples sur les mosaïques et les peintures…aussi les savants, les artistes, les amateurs, attendent-ils avec impatience, depuis près de cinquante ans, un ouvrage exact et complet sur les antiquites de cette ville…. (Anon, n.d.) Les plans sont tout réduits sur une même échelle, ainsi que les elevations et les coupes…en un mot j'ai cherché a ne rien omettre de ce qui peut aider a expliquer clairment chacun des edifices, et servir a les comparer entre eux. (Anon, n.d.) And as we have seen (above, p. 186) Mazois is aware, too, of the importance of Pompeii in transforming knowledge of the ancient house (and hence of the fabric of the city). He placed his study of the ruins of Pompeii in the context of thoughts about the relation of the discipline of architecture to the city and to the house, a context that links Vitruvius, Alberti, and Palladio. The manner of Mazois's presentation makes these connections clear; the first volume describes the walls, the gates, the roads that lead to them (and the tombs that line them); the second volume, the houses; the third volume, secular public buildings; the fourth, temples (and theatres). The city is presented to us in a Vitruvian sequence; Mazois's division into volumes closely parallels that of Palladio's Quattro Libri (book II, houses; book III, fora and basilicas; book IV, temples). Mazois, like Vitruvius, describes the ancient city through the whole range of its elements, from the walls and streets (Fig. 10.3) to the buildings, both public and private, and then, like Vitruvius, to detail of painted decoration (Fig. 10.4): Les ruines de Pompéi permettent de remplacer désormais les conjectures par des certitudes, et les restaurations hasardées des artistes modernes par le portrait fidèle des monuments demeurés presque intacts jusque dans les parties les plus fugitives de leurs decorations brillantes. 33 And so in discussing, for example, the House of Sallust, Mazois' shows the way that, in the pergola garden, the painted walls with their painted plants, painted birds, and painted fountain contribute to the charm of the whole (Fig 10. Les parois du mur, qui entoure de deux côtés ce délicieux réduit, sont peintes avec une goût exquis…la decoration…rapelle cette piece de la maison de Pline en Toscane: \"ou l'on voyait des oiseaux perchés sur des ramaux verdoyants et au-dessous une petite fontaine dont l'eau tombait dans un bassin avec un agréable 'murmur'.\" (Anon, n.d.) The same attention to the indissoluble effect of architecture and decoration is evident when Mazois describes the peristyle of the house with the rooms that surround it. The group must, he says, be, \"un appartement secret, consacré au plaisir et a l'amour\" 35 with its: Cabinets: dans l'un d'eux existe encore une peinture qui indique assez la destination de ces boudoirs; on y voit Mars enchaîné dans les bras de Vénus, tandis que l'amour joue en riant avec les armes terribles du dieu de combats. (Anon, n.d.) … Cette decoration est d'un goût délicieux; les ornements ôtent au fond noir, ce qu'a de trop lugubre cette colour dont on fit choix, sans doute, a fin de donner plus d'éclat au tient et aux vêtements des femmes admises dans ce volupteux séjour… Le tableau au fond de la cour représente… Actéon découvrant Diane au bain, et…le même personage dévoré par ses chiens. Ce sujet semble avoir été choisi, et place dans l'endroit le plus apparent pour avertir tout indiscret qui eût tenté de pénétrer les mystères de ce lieu des châtiments inévitables qui l'attendraient. (Anon, n.d.) Mazois returned finally to Paris in 1820 (where he built little, this little however including the Passages Choiseul and Saucède); he died in 1826. The remainder of the century saw a continuous stream of studies and reconstructions from the students of the Villa Medici 38 -but none of this work, though, goes beyond Mazois in conception. Perhaps inevitably, due to the particular requirements of the Envois, 39 the concentration was on the details of the orders, painted decoration, or monumental groups of buildings, such as the forum (Anon, n.d.) or the theatre district, 41 but not with the city as a whole. Not until the turn of the century did pensionnaires concern themselves with the study of a complete 42 town with, most notably, Tony Garnier's study of Tusculum of 1903 and Jean Hulot's reconstruction of Selinus of 1904-1906. (Anon, n.d.) Of prime importance for the 20th century is the work of Tony Garnier. Tony Garnier (1869-1948) seems to us now to stand between two worlds-the world of the great French academic system of architectural teaching and practice, represented by the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Villa Medici in Rome-and the world of the beginning of what we now call Modern architecture. Garnier's time as pensionnaire at the Villa Medici, between 1900 and 1904, precisely marks this transition. (Anon, n.d.) In the first year of his tenure, in addition to the required (but according to the academy, inadequate) 45 study of an ancient monument (in his case the Tabularium) Garnier submitted drawings of an Industrial City invented for a site near Lyons (\"a daub of pencil marks\", reported the academy). (Anon, n.d.) Garnier's final envoi, too, was an urban study-a restoration of the town of Tusculum (which for Garnier had the advantage of very few remains to constrain him). (Anon, n.d.) That restoration (Fig. 10.6) clearly borrowed from Pompeii, where Garnier's fellow pensionnaire, Chifflot, had made restoration drawings of the House of the Centenary in the previous year. 48 Following his return to his home town of Lyons in 1904, a further enlarged and revised version of the Cité industrielle reached publication in 1917, (Anon, n.d.) this publication now being augmented by built work carried out in Lyons, presented uniformly as if part of the development of the earlier proposals. The house and studio, of 1909-10, that Garnier had built for himself at SaintRambert, is included in the plates (Fig. 10.8), 51 a house that, without columns or classical detail, is an abstraction of a Pompeian house. Garnier's atelier is as symmetrically related to its atrium as, say, the tablinum of the House of the Faun to its atrium and peristyle, and the house is photographed (plates 121 and 122 of Une cité industrielle) with all the attention to ways in which a sense of light and greenery suffuses from atrium and garden that so delighted Mazois at the House of Sallust. A half-size nude statue of Madame Garnier facing the atrium seems to play the same rôle in suggesting the intimacy of domestic life as does the painting of Mars and Venus in Mazois's description of the peristyle at the House of Sallust (p. 189 above). In the 1917 publication, the industrial and public elements, too, are supplemented by examples from Garnier's practice in Lyon; but the real point here is not the separate elements, but that all elements are presented together as part of a total organization-the visual equivalent of a social organization-and there is indeed a social as well as a cultural programme in the work. Garnier proposes the inscription of passages from Zola's Travail on the walls of his \"Chamber of Assemblies\" (Travail was first published Garnier was searching for a topic for his work at the Villa Medici). (Anon, 1990) Anthony Vidler has discussed this social programme in the catalogue of the 1990 exhibition of Garnier's work at the Centre Pompidou (Anon, n.d.) but my concern here is to note that Garnier presents the city as an organic whole, a collective work of art-proceeding, in a way reminiscent of Vitruvius, from the establishment of the settlement on its site, to the various types of public buildings: the assembly halls, the sports buildings, the schools, the factories, each finding a place within a structure articulated by streets and alleys, with individual houses, like Garnier's own, offering at once a retreat from, and by analogy, a connection with, the organism as a whole. Garnier's period at the Villa Medici had been a turbulent one. The inscription on his 1901 drawing of the Tabularium, \"Ainsi que toutes les architectures reposant sur des principes faux l'architecture antique fut une erreur. La vérité seule est belle\", (Mckay et al., 1957) is indicative (and duly enraged the academy). Garnier's pugnaciously critical attitude to antiquity released him from its sway. What he did take from antiquity became his own. Garnier's work was widely transmitted to the architectural world through the most influential architectural text of the 20th century, Le Corbusier's Vers une architecture of 1923, which presented, with approving comments, plans and perspectives of the housing areas of the Cité. (Anon, 1970) Le Corbusier had met Tony Garnier in Lyons in 1907 and tells us: He had won the \"Grand Prix d'Architecture\" and it was from Rome that he sent his project the \"ville industrielle\". This man discerned the approach of a new architecture based on social phenomena. His plans show great sophistication. They stand at the end of a hundred years of architectural evolution in France. (Kolendo, 1985) Four years after that meeting, Le Corbusier was himself in Pompeii, (Anon, n.d.) and responding in a way that is close to the abstracted interpretation of the atrium house that Garnier created at Saint-Rambert. Le Corbusier describes his experience of the House of the Silver Wedding thus: And then you are in the atrium; four columns (four cylinders) shoot upwards towards the shade of the roof…but at the far end is the brilliance of the garden seen through the peristyle which spreads out this light with a large gesture, distributes it and accentuates it, stretching widely from left to right… Our elements are walls…. The walls are in full brilliant light or in half shade or in full shadow…your symphony is made…. Have respect for walls. The Pompeian did not cut up his wallspaces. He was devoted to wall spaces and loved light… The impression of light is extended outside by cylinders (I hardly like to say columns, a worn out word) 58 Designed by Le Corbusier, and incorporating his own version of a Cité industrielle, the pavilion itself was in the form of a prototypical apartment dwelling, arranged round a hanging garden. Within the pavilion is presented a diorama of the city, of which the apartment blocks-Le Corbusier called them immeubles-villas (Fig. 10.11)-were the elements, the insulae, of the city. As well as this presentation at the city scale were shown the paintings, rugs, furniture and equipment conforming to that new spirit, l'esprit nouveau, which Le Corbusier and his collaborators were exploring and promoting through their magazine-the final issue of which served as a catalogue for the pavillion. (Maj, 1955) \"We were not concerned with frivolities,\" wrote Le Corbusier; \"we went from the everyday object to the urbanisation of great cities-an enormous undertaking.\" (Anon, 1982) Within the pavilion, arranged around the atrium-like jardin suspendu, as in a Pompeian house, or Garnier's studio at Saint-Rambert, the visitor's mind was focused on the one hand, by means of the diorama, to the scale of the city of which the pavilion was a microcosm, and on the other to the scale of the objects of everyday life-most particularly to works of painting and sculpture (Fig. 10.12): Painting: We have placed on the wall-paintings of Picasso, Braque, Léger, Gris, Ozenfant, Jeanneret, and arranged sculptures by Lipchitz; easel paintings in frames and free standing sculpture, independent of the wall. We are not, at the moment, partisans of fresco painting… It is better that painting or sculpture is not made to order but is a direct product of the imagination. We want to create an architectural terrain made from matter, from light, and from proportion, in which works with high emotional potential are at ease. We detach painting and sculpture from the wall so that they are free to act with the charge that they contain. (Anon, 1988) These \"purist\" paintings (as their authors christened them) presented an imaginative reflection of images of everyday and industrial life, surely the equivalent in the Pompeian house of paintings of \"poultry, eggs, vegetables, fruit\", (Finley, 1993) \"the battles of Troy and the wanderings of Ulysses over the countryside\", or \"Mars locked in the arms of Venus\". This equivalence is not, of course, to be taken as an exact one; in what is for Le Corbusier a characteristic strategy of disengagement, or articulation, of elements, the wall and its modulation of light (Anon, n.d.) are separated from the figuration of representational painting. The continuum between the macrocosm of the city and the microcosm of the dwelling (and the imaginative world re-created through its decoration), so powerfully presented by Mazois, has been taken apart and reassembled. The desire for that continuum, though, remains. In the introduction to his Aspects of antiquity Moses Finley cites John Jones, in turn citing Fustel de Coulanges: \"Rien dans les temps moderne ne leur [Gréce et Rome] ressemble. Riens dans l'avenir ne pourra leur ressembler\". (Anon, 1983) The responses, in the modern world, to the ruins of Pompeii that I have discussed may show resemblances to the ancient city but, to echo Mazois's comment on Palladio's atria, each \"must be regarded in some way as a new invention\". One might say that it is when most thoroughly and critically transformed, in the work of a Le Corbusier or a Garnier, that responses to the ancient city have had most resonance. The Nachleben of the ancient world does not flow simply as a stream. hitectes Français au XIX e siècle (Paris, 1980), pp. 291-2. F & J.B.

The reader is referred to a plan at the end of the work for the numbering of the houses.

    "full_text": "THE CASE OF POMPEII 1 Since Géza Alföldy published his famous model of Roman society almost forty years ago, this iconic image has become the standard representation of its social order (Fig. 1). 2 Graphic representations of this kind are a powerful means of expressing structures and hierarchies, and because they, by necessity, are simplified abstractions they also force us to consider how we conceptualise a social totality; in this case they bring to the fore the difficulties involved in any attempt to define a society according to a specific set of criteria. Alföldy's chosen framework was the hierarchy of personal statuses that constituted the backbone of Roman society. The three ordines, partly divided into subcategories, formed the upper tiers, while the rest of the population -plebs, freedmen, and slaves -constituted a vertically differentiated substrate of society. Despite its seemingly self-evident logic and wide acceptance, Alföldy's model has also met with some criticism, especially among German scholars, who have pointed out inconsistencies in his approach to social stratification and also queried the validity of some of the criteria he used. (Anon, n.d.) Thus it remains an open question whether we can capture the complex social reality of ancient Rome through legal definitions alone. In principle these could be represented as a simple list of personal statuses in descending order, and following that logic Aloys Winterling replaced Alföldy's pyramid with two basic status rankings, one representing the state and the other the familia (Fig. 2). The model could be further refined by applying an imperial perspective that would add categories such as cives Romani, Latini, and peregrini. While Alföldy's model is essentially structured around formal categories, he also arranged them into the familiar pyramid shape, which introduced an element of scale and quantitative differentiation. In doing so he transformed the model from an abstract diagram into an actual depiction of Roman society. But perhaps more importantly he sought to take some account of the distribution of economic resources. What prompted this departure from the overall concept was the existence of affluent freedmen and imperial liberti, who were included in the form of a mini pyramid superimposed on the conventional status hierarchy. Likewise, at the pinnacle of the pyramid the domus imperatoria was recognised as a category in its own right despite its lack of formal status in order to reflect its exceptional power and resources. Finally, the mass of the population was divided into urban and rural, thereby adding yet another, geographical factor to the equation. The multiplicity of criteria applied and the inconsistencies that this inevitably creates remind us of the need for methodological clarity in exercises of this kind. Since the analysis can be based on a number of different parameters that do not produce the same result, the historian must consider the different outcomes and decide which aspects of the social totality the model is primarily intended to illustrate. Importantly in this context, it forces us to reassess the posited correlation between wealth and status that constituted the basis for Alföldy's model. Most societies show a broad correspondence between status and wealth and in Rome this link was even stronger since membership of the elite was not heritable but -partly -based on economic criteria that had to be met in each generation. The absence of a formalised hereditary aristocracy meant that the image of the impoverished nobleman, so familiar from later European history, was far less common in Rome, where this type tended to disappear from view. Nevertheless, there were notable exceptions to this correlation, most obviously the affluent freedmen, whom Alföldy tried to accommodate in what was otherwise a purely status-based model. But the problem goes beyond the existence of this particular 'status dissonance' -to use Keith Hopkins' sociological terminology -caused by Roman manumission practices, however glaring it may have been. (Anon, n.d.) Although the definition of the highest orders was overtly plutocratic, especially after the Augustan reform which devised separate property bands for the highest orders, it is not given that they always conformed directly to the social hierarchy; some men of substance might, for example, have chosen not to pursue senatorial careers, as had occasionally happened already in the Late Republic. Rank and wealth did not, therefore, automatically coincide, even within the top elite. But if we take a step down the status ladder, to the level of the municipality, there is a further twist since the local ordines decurionum typically are contrasted with a so-called 'sub-elite' that comprises virtually everybody outside the official honours system. Indeed, in Alföldy's model the most sharply drawn line of the entire diagram was precisely that separating the ordo decurionum from those below. But the question is whether such formal distinctions really reflect the social reality of a community. The obvious place to investigate the issue in greater depth is Pompeii, which offers a more detailed picture of the municipal elite than is available anywhere else in the Roman Empire. Fig. 2: Winterling's model of the status hierarchies in Roman society (Winterling 2001) Although access to public office and ordo-membership depended on the census, we cannot automatically equate the ordo with the elite; for while the elite undoubtedly belonged to the ordo, it is not given that all members of the elite fitted into the ordo. Conversely, one could ask whether the elite necessarily was a homogeneous body, in which case the real elite might just have been a subsection of the ordo. The ordo was in principle a random number of people usually determined by administrative features such as the number of new ex-magistrates entering the body each year. Although there seems to have been some variation in the number of decurions, this did not fully reflect the range of town sizes. It might, therefore, have borne relatively little relation to the size of the community, to its socio-economic structure, and hence to the naturally occurring elite. We do not know how large the Pompeian ordo was, but all indications point to a body considerably smaller than the hundred councillors often assumed in textbooks. (Anon, n.d.) But while the precise size of the council remains uncertain, there is strong evidence that the boundary between ordo and sub-ordo was fluid, with a large pool of families able and willing to hold local office and sit on the council. Looking more closely at the elections at Pompeii, it becomes clear that there was considerable competition, especially for the lower office of the aedileship, which secured the holder a life-long seat in the ordo. This in itself indicates that the economic stratum of affluent families who qualified for the census decurionalis and were capable of meeting the cost of public office exceeded the number of decurions. Our picture of the curial order in Pompeii is incomplete even for the last generation of its existence. Nevertheless, during the thirty-year period between 50 and 79 CE -when 60 new aediles would have been elected -no fewer than 126 individual candidates, magistrates, and decurions are recorded in electoral posters, tablets and tituli. (Anon, n.d.) In this context the distinction between candidates and elected magistrates is less important since they all belonged to the same propertied class. Moreover, this is the mere minimum; to this figure should be added a number of likely members of this class, since there is a gap in the record in the 40s CE, when many councillors would have entered the ordo and remained there till the final period. (Anon, n.d.) The fact that many magistrates datable to the 50s CE are absent from the electoral posters or appear in just a single programma also suggests that not all magistrates and candidates from that decade are known to us. (Anon, n.d.) The Iucundus tablets, dating to the same period, also feature several high-ranking 5 In order to reach this figure a substantial number of non-magisterial decurions would have been required for whom there is relatively little evidence in Pompeii; cf. Mouritsen 1998. 6 Mouritsen 1988, with further updates in appendix 1. 7 Or they might have entered the ordo even earlier, such as L. Lucretius Satrius Valens, aedile in 33 CE and later duovir, who must have kept his seat well into the last generation of Pompeii. Likewise it is highly likely that the curial family of the Umbricii Scauri retained its prominence during the final period, as suggested by their continued business activity and imposing house. Other members include the decurio (later aedile?) L. Lucretius Valens, who was admitted during the reign of Claudius, and the young decurio N. Popidius Celsinus. 8 We, therefore, also keep discovering new candidates, such as the aedilician candidate Pettius; cf. Giordano -Casale 1991, no. 33. witnesses (at least fifteen) who are likely to have been magistrates/candidates, bringing our total to 141. And if we consider the composition of the recorded family names, we find that the candidates and magistrates carried 88 different gentilicia, to which should be added elite families documented through prominent women and those represented by high-ranking witnesses in the Iucundus tablets. This gives us a figure of 99 elite 'families' with distinct gentilicia; the impression, therefore, is of a potential curial class that was considerably larger than the actual one. Some of these families remained prominent over long periods and were in many cases split into different branches with separate praenomina. Often they fielded several candidates in the same generation and held multiple magistracies including the highest one, the quinquennial duovirate with censorial powers. By contrast, other families were clearly more marginal, represented by only a single member and often just in one generation. This would suggest an overall structure to the ordo consisting of an inner circle and an outer ring of less permanent curial families. (Anon, n.d.) The curial class emerging from this evidence was, therefore, not homogenous but internally stratified, unstable and permeable at the edges. A continuous turnover of families thus appears integral to the make-up of the ordo, but at the same time combined with an essential stability provided by a powerful group of core families. Depending on how we look at this structure, we could, therefore, say that the Pompeian elite was either larger or smaller than the ordo, but not identical with it. A similar picture emerges from the -admittedly few -examples of identifiable houses belonging to the curial elite (Fig. 3), which reveals a mix of sizes and styles, ranging from the very grand to the considerably more modest.foot_2 Thus, the survey shows several candidates and magistrates living in relatively small houses, including M. Lucretius Fronto, M. Casellius Marcellus, Q. Bruttius Balbus, and A. Trebius Valens. While house size by no means represents a foolproof indicator of the occupants' social standing, it may still provide a broad measure of their wealth. And by placing these findings in the wider context of Pompeian housing we may be able to cast further light on the relationship between the elite and the ordo. Looking at houses of the domus type, roughly two tiers can be identifiedwithout making any claims to scientific accuracy. (Anon, n.d.) The highest level consists of very large houses with spacious atria and peristyles (sometimes multiple) and several formal dining rooms. Forty-six houses can be assigned to this category, to which we may hypothetically add eight in the unexcavated parts of the town (Fig. 4). Below this level we find a number of smaller but still relatively substantial houses of the atrium-peristyle type. The minimum house size qualifying for inclusion in this category is set by the smallest of the curial residences identified above, and on this criterion the group comprises 100 houses, in addition to a conjectural twenty yet to be discovered (Fig. 5). These calculations take us to a likely total of 174 elite houses, a number that seems well above what members of the curia could have occupied. (Anon, n.d.) The structure of urban housing in Pompeii would then seem to provide yet another indication that the pool of potential curial families was considerably larger than the ordo itself. Which of these aspiring families managed to get into the ordo may to some extent have been a matter of chance, elections always carrying an element of unpredictability. However, connections and patronage probably played an important part, as suggested by occasional glimpses of the underlying political process gained from the electoral posters. The candidate A. Trebius Valens was, for example, described as a cliens of M. Epidius Sabinus, a powerful figure in late Pompeii (CIL IV 7605). And it was probably not by chance that M. Casellius Marcellus, apparently a homo novus, ran for office together with L. Albucius Celsus, the scion of a prominent old family, suggesting that their joint electoral ticket represented patronage in action. The success and indeed wealth of new families may often have derived from such support. Property would have been regularly passed around between families through inheritances and dowries, and not even the most powerful families were immune to the hazards posed by the mortality rates, as illustrated by the case of the Eumachii, who appear to have become extinct during the first century CE. (Anon, n.d.) Therefore, while some new families may have been recent arrivals to the city, including imperial freedmen, many others would have been local Pompeians, some of them the sons of freedmen who had benefited from patronal favours. The result was an open and diverse elite that extended well beyond the actual ordo, membership of which merely formalised the status of a subsection within it, sometimes for a relatively brief period of time. The existence of a substantial category of affluent families, sometimes with a share of formal status, suggests that we are dealing with a continuum of wealth, which in theory may have reached even further down the social scale. As such it offers at least partial support for the Fig. 5: Medium-sized elite houses in Pompeii recent attempts to present a more nuanced picture of Roman social stratification which have questioned the sharp division into rich and poor and have argued for the existence of 'middling' groups in Roman society. (Anon, n.d.) The traditional bipolar model, to which these scholars react, reflected the status-focused approach, exemplified by Alföldy, which inevitably over-simplifies our image of social hierarchies. The point is that despite the finely calibrated class distinctions at the top of society, the Romans otherwise operated with a limited set of categories, which left the mass of citizens more or less undifferentiated. Thus, apart from the classes of the Republican comitia centuriata, which became obsolete under the Empire, the vast majority of the freeborn population was not formally subdivided according to status. Therefore, if we take the legal framework as our only guide to social reality, we invariably end up with a polarised vision of Roman society dominated by a fundamental split between the members of the ordines and those who did not belong to them. Needless to say, the social landscape must have been more complex and comprised middling groups that carried no formal definition. The re-evaluation of the non-elite is, therefore, both welcome and long overdue. However, some scholars have gone further and tried to revive the idea of a Roman 'middle class', sometimes using the term 'plebs media' to give it an air of authenticity. (Anon, n.d.) The question is to whom such a label would have applied and, more fundamentally, whether this modern concept is really helpful for understanding Roman society. The problem is that a 'middle class', as opposed to 'middling' groups, is not defined solely by its intermediate economic position, but involves a set of additional characteristics related to behaviour, ideology and social attitudes that distinguishes it from those of the classes above and below. From the outset it should be noted that it makes little sense to see the extended curia, identified above, as a class in its own right, let alone a 'middle class', since there are no signs that it differed from the top elite in terms of values, behaviour or lifestyle -it simply had fewer resources. The same would seem to apply further down the social scale, most fundamentally because the class markers traditionally used to separate elites and middle classes do not apply in towns like Pompeii. Central to the theory of the 'middle class' is the notion of economic differentiation and the identification of intermediate groups as more commercial than the supposedly land-owning aristocracy. Without entering into the primitivist/modernist debate, it should be noted that at municipal level we find little trace of the posited aristocratic disdain for commerce, which Cicero famously expressed in his De officiis. In Pompeii most affluent families appear to have relied on a mixed portfolio, which included not just land but also various forms of urban production and in many cases also trade. Above all, the elite's urban estates were integral to their economic basis with most elite houses incorporating tabernae and other commercial premises. (Anon, n.d.) The epigraphic evidence tells a similar story, with amphora inscriptions and stamps showing the prominence of elite families in the production and distribution of a variety of products. Even curial families made no attempt to hide their involvement, as the famous example of the Umbricii Scauri demonstrates.foot_8 It follows that if the elite maintained extensive interests in every aspect of the urban economy, it becomes difficult to identify a specifically commercial class distinct from the curiales. There was of course one group which seems to have been deeply involved in all things commercial, and they were the freedmen, the very category that also tends to upset modern attempts at modelling Roman society. To gain an idea of the sheer scale of their involvement, we may briefly consider the 152 Iucundus tablets whose witness lists provide a unique insight into the commercial circles of Pompeii. They belong to the period 50-62 CE and feature 320 witnesses listed in a rough ranking according to status. (Anon, n.d.) The witnesses can be divided into three main categories: 1) documented or likely members of curial elite, 2) members of apparently freeborn non-curial families, 3) and freedmen, primarily identified on the basis of onomastics. The latter seem to make up no fewer than 70% of the 285 non-curial signatories. This figure tallies with a wide range of other types of evidence such as amphora inscriptions and metal stamps, which all suggest that freedmen occupied a dominant position in the urban economy. The prominence of former slaves shows the futility of relying entirely on formal criteria to describe social hierarchies, but the answer may not simply be to insert a new category between plebs and elite. The contradictions inherent in conventional stratigraphic models suggest we will have to rethink the ways in which we visualise Roman society. The status-based pyramid adopted by Alföldy could not easily accommodate the existence of affluent freedmen, and he, therefore, presented them as an autonomous social hierarchy that partly overlapped with the higher echelons. This was also the solution preferred by François Jacques and John Scheid, whose model is a more complex but also less visually coherent attempt to represent Roman society. There the analytical isolation of the freedmen is even more pronounced, since their pyramid has become entirely detached from the rest of society (Fig. 6). (Anon, n.d.) Their separation of the freedmen is of course correct in terms of rank and status, but by treating them as an anomalous category that somehow fell outside the normal ordering of society the model is unable to account for their numbers and manifest economic importance. (Anon, n.d.) What seems to be missing from these models is a consideration of the links and ties that existed between the different social strata as well as the flow of resources which they facilitated. In the models of Alföldy and Jacques/Scheid freedmen are far removed from the elite, either entirely separate or bundled up with slaves and the free plebs among the poorly differentiated masses. But their remarkable numbers and relative success are probably better understood as a function of their intimate connections with the elite, which continued to replenish their ranks through a steady stream of new manumissions. While freedmen and local aristocrats could not have been further apart from a status perspective, in reality they shared the same world and the fortunes of the former were inseparable from the values and economic strategies of the latter. (Jacques -Scheid 1990) The Roman elite were famously adverse to employing staff that were not subject to their own personal authority. As a result the familia became the key social and economic unit, which in turn created a direct link between top and bottom of society -largely to the exclusion of those in-between. The striking closeness that existed between masters and slaves/freedmen in the urban environment opened up a wide range of opportunities. Freed slaves became institutionally integrated into the familia, with the former owner assuming the pseudo-paternal role of patronus while the freed person adopted the patron's family name. As members of the extended familia freedmen remained bound by both formal and informal tiesmoral, personal, legal, and financial -which allowed them to be put in positions of trust within what might be described as 'family firms'. In practical terms they benefited from basic education and training which might lead to further support and investments. Many stayed with their patron after manumission, performing the same tasks as before, while others were employed under a variety of different managerial arrangements, including tenancies, which offered access to commercial premises in the form of tabernae and workshops, or partnerships that allowed them a degree of independence as well as a share of profits. The Iucundus tablets offer interesting insight into the importance of familial backing. As noted earlier, the large majority of the witnesses appear to have been freed, and a very large proportion of them came from leading familiae. Thus, if we ignore the witnesses who were themselves members of the elite, 185, or 65%, of the remaining 285 carried the gentilicial names of families that had held or run for office. Some high-ranking and prominent freedmen may belong to relatively unknown families, but since freedmen are a priori unlikely to be wealthier than their patrons, we may assume they too came from a comfortable background. (Anon, n.d.) Their patrons may have left little epigraphic trace, but the fact that non-freedmen did not usually put up funerary inscriptions in late Pompeii means that many families outside the ordo are known to us only through their freedmen. 22 Moreover, it is entirely possible that many of these families were in fact represented among the missing candidates and magistrates from the 40s and 50s CE when our coverage is patchy. While the precise scale of manumission in Roman Italy cannot be determined with any certainty, there is ample evidence to suggest that the practice was very common and freedmen extremely numerous. The most unequivocal data come from neighbouring Herculaneum, where fragments of an extensive album listing the local citizens indicate that a remarkably high share of the population was freed, and a similar impression is conveyed by evidence from Misenum. (Anon, n.d.) In order to understand the scale of manumission it is perhaps instructive to cast a glance at the local elites with which this phenomenon was so closely connected and, in particular, their economic power. Thus, if we again take their dwellings as a rough indicator of wealth and revisit the Pompeii maps presented above, we find that the domus of the elite, including what we might call the wider -or potential -ordo, make up a strikingly large proportion of the domestic housing (cf. Fig. 7). (Anon, n.d.) is in 21 They include, for example, the magister pagi Aug. Felicis suburbani L. Barbidius L.l. Communis and the augustalis and paganus C. Munatius Faustus, and among the Iucundus witnesses C. Atullius Euander, T. Sornius Eutychus and Cn. Vibrius Callistus. 22 As argued in Mouritsen 2005. 23 Mouritsen 2011, 129-131; Herculaneum: Camodeca 2008, 87-98; Wallace-Hadrill 2011, 138-139; Misenum: D'Arms 2000. 24 When evaluating the overall distribution of elite housing in Pompeii it should of course be borne in mind that substantial parts of regions I, II, and III had been given over to gardens, orchards, and vineyards in the final period of the town's existence. the context of this aristocratic world that the Pompeian freedmen should be viewed, their numbers and relative prominence directly reflecting the power and resources of the local ruling class. This symbiotic relationship between the elite and their slaves/freedmen in the urban environment affected the conventional hierarchies, and if standards of living are also factored in, the 'dissonance' becomes even more pronounced since domestic staff, irrespective of personal status, often enjoyed a better quality of life at least in material terms than many of those who ranked far above them. Faced with such contradictions we are reminded again that no model can capture the structure of Roman society as a whole -only certain aspects of it. And since by its very nature a model is not a representation but an attempt to draw attention to certain significant features -in deliberately simplified form -the question is which features we consider to be the more significant. And here the aim must be to present a model that does not dismiss a substantial -and indeed vital section of society -as an aberration from the norm but is able to account for its significance within the chosen frame of reference. We will, in other words, have to rethink how a social structure is conceptualised, not just in terms of layering and connections but also with regard to the visual imagery used to express this understanding graphically. Presenting Roman society as a pyramid may seem logical, although the shape in itself is of little heuristic value, since it, to a greater or lesser extent, is applicable to all societies where the poor are also the many. More importantly, however, it fails to highlight what was in fact distinctive about Roman society, which was precisely the fundamental tension that existed between status, on the one hand, and economic resources and standards of living, on the other. As an alternative one might consider a model that shows not just the overwhelming concentration of resources in the hands of the elite but also takes account of the wider social, economic and demographic repercussions this had on society. To that end the application of a bird's-eye view of society may be more helpful, and from that perspective the socio-economic order emerges as a set of concentric circles (Fig. 8). At the very centre we find an inner core of powerful aristocratic families of long-standing prominence and extensive resources. (Anon, n.d.) Around this group existed an outer band of minor curial families, which competed for a limited number of seats on the council. This group was less stable and probably to some extent dependent on patronage and political support from the inner Fig. 8: A model of the social structure of Pompeii core of families. The next circle, in turn, is occupied by the extensive elite households, made up of slaves and freedmen, many of whom lived comfortably or even in considerable affluence. They prospered from their association with the elite, which opened up economic opportunities that were generally not available to the population at large. Finally, in the outer ring were located the free but 'unconnected' poor, who had little access to education, training, or the investments that depended on personal trust and familiarity with social superiors. Since they had little to offer in return for patronage, their prospects were further reduced by the elite's preference for personally controlled staff, which forced them to rely on short-term, low-skilled employment. Presumably most members of this category suffered a precarious existence dominated by a daily struggle for economic survival. (Anon, n.d.) The purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the lack of correlation between status and economic circumstances while also highlighting the importance of social ties. As the rings spread out, wealth declined, and furthest away from the aristocratic core we find the 'structurally' poor, who were defined not just economically but also socially, since their economic disadvantage was matched by social marginality. As such the labour strategies of the elite created a very different kind of polarisation from that entailed by Alföldy's status-based model, one that paradoxically left the free poor far more exposed than those who formally ranked below them. But this reversal of 'normal' hierarchies does not of course imply that status did not matter to the Romans; indeed the elite preferred slaves and freedmen precisely because of their inferior and dependent status. (Anon, n.d.) The model could, therefore, be seen as an illustration of Tacitus' famous distinction between the respectable plebs, who were attached to the grand houses, and the rabble that was not. (Anon, n.d.) While steeped in conventional elite prejudices, the passage may still reflect real socioeconomic patterns that concentrated economic opportunities around elite households and reduced large sections of the lower classes to 'structural' poverty. At this point we may briefly revisit the question of the 'middling class' in light of our model. Was there a defined social group between the elite and their familiae and the most disadvantaged plebs? It is not implausible that such a social layer (tentatively indicated in Fig. 9) could have existed, but it must also be recognised just how little we know about its size, social profile and economic basis. We cannot identify them securely in the urban fabric, since the fact that a house is of middling size and décor does not per se indicate that the occupants belonged to a specific middling group; they might well be freedmen or perhaps even minor relatives of curiales. Similarly, the frequently made association of this social layer with tabernae, retail and craft production seems to project later European petites bourgeoisies onto the very different world of ancient Rome where these functions typically were performed by dependent labour. (Anon, n.d.) What we can say is that such a stratum would have been inherently unstable, its members' modest resources reducing their ability to withstand the fundamental uncertainties of life in the ancient world. Certainly, the image of a 'solid middle class', sometimes invoked, seems misplaced. There can have been nothing solid about this middling group; more likely it was fluid, heterogeneous and probably often dependent. If, for example, we take the children of liberti, often seen as potential members of such a category, we may doubt how numerous they were, given that many freedmen did not produce freeborn offspring because of late or informal manumission. Moreover, their economic fortunes would have been quite insecure as the source of their relative prosperity usually derived from the familia they left behind. They would, therefore, have tended to either rise or sink socially, according to the level of patronal support they continued to receive. If none was forthcoming or their familia was broken up among external heirs, they would in all probability have drifted into the outer ring of our diagram. Alternatively, if they found favour they might well have entered the ranks of the curial hopefuls. Similar patterns would have applied to other members of the 'middling' plebs whose prospects would have been closely tied to patronal support from social superiors. It follows that to the extent such a layer existed it would probably have been fairly transient, lacked a clear social profile and displayed none of the characteristics nowadays associated with a 'middle class'. General models of social structure such as the ones discussed above are not just simplified abstractions but also, by necessity, static in nature, describing a more or less stable set of relationships at a given moment in time. It may, however, be worthwhile briefly to consider the possibility of adding a diachronic aspect to our picture of Pompeian society, given the city's unparalleled archaeological record. When looking at the urban fabric from that perspective, two salient features immediately stand out, both of which demonstrate the dynamic nature of elite housing. Firstly, the character of the familia as a complex and layered socio-economic unit, described above, is apparent in the mix of formal representative spaces, 'service' areas, and commercial facilities that all formed part of the urban estates of the elite. Moreover, these three types of spaces were continually adjusted and modified over time, perhaps partly mirroring the fluctuating fortunes of the owner, but also taking advantage of emerging commercial opportunities; thus, even the richest houses demonstrate an acute awareness of the earning potential offered by urban real estate -seemingly unperturbed by the moral opprobrium conventionally associated with such income. Secondly, even a quick glance at the houses of the elite reveals a remarkably consistent trend towards ever greater concentration of urban property in fewer and fewer hands. This phenomenon can be traced across the history of Roman Pompeii and even further back into Samnite times, and while each aristocratic house followed its own trajectory and developed at its own pace, the overall tendency towards accumulation of property is nevertheless clear. All the large domus included in our highest category and many of those in the second tier were the result of a gradual, steady process of expansion which saw the absorption of several smaller houses into a single sprawling residence. (Anon, n.d.) The result was often highly complex layouts which comprised several entrances, atria, reception areas and colonnaded garden spaces, the so-called 'peristyles'. In some cases the process was completed already in the second century BCE, e.g. the House of the Faun, 31 but in others it continued well into the first century CE, most strikingly in the case of the House of the Lyre Player (I 4,5.25), which went through successive expansions and modifications stretching over more than 200 years. In some instances we can trace beneath later changes the faint (and admittedly partly hypothetical) outline of the original ownership structures, which suggest that when the insulae were first divided up, they were split into plots of broadly similar size. For example, the House of the Menander (I 10,4) covers what may once have been four or five separate plots, while the House of the Lyre Player eventually came to occupy five of the original units and parts of two others. (Anon, n.d.) These processes raise interesting questions about the social structure of early Pompeii, which judging from the domestic fabric appears to have been a relatively egalitarian society with limited variation in property sizes and, presumably, a fairly even distribution of wealth. Against this background the later developments are so much more remarkable, since the accumulation of urban property must be indicative of increased inequality and a corresponding decline of 30 The fullest discussion of this process is that of Ling 1997, 238-247. 31 Hoffmann -Faber 2009, 103-109, who note that its expansion happened at the expense of several smaller houses which previously occupied the insula. 32 H. Geertman's attempt at reconstructing the original layout of the Insula of the Menander seems highly conjectural: see Geertman 1998, 24-25, figs. 19-20. For a more cautious approach see Ling 1997, 223-232. The House of the Lyre Player has been studied by S.C. Nappo, whose reconstruction is shown in Nappo 1988, 29, fig. 23. VI 15,7.38 is another instructive example: cf. Seiler 1992. previously prominent 'middling' groups, whose dwellings make up an everdiminishing proportion of the urban housing stock. (Anon, n.d.) The growth of elite houses suggests that the ancient mortality regime and the continuous redistribution of assets and property that entailed did not, as one might have expected, lead to a 'flattening' of the social pyramid. It created a wider and in some respects less permanent elite which, as we saw, was relatively fluid at the edges, but there is no indication that it led to a more even distribution of resources among the citizens of Pompeii as a whole. In fact, quite the opposite seems to have been the case, with the archaeological evidence suggesting a widening gap between rich and poor. It would appear, therefore, that factors such as mortality and the practice of partible inheritance concentrated rather than spread resources. Presumably estates, in their entirety or in parts, were left to other members of the elite, either long-established or rising newcomers, but rarely to citizens outside of this circle. (Anon, n.d.) In terms of our model of Roman society, the implication is that those located in our -hypothetical -band of 'middling' Pompeians (cf. Fig. 9) did not benefit to any significant extent from elite support or legacies; while some may have risen individually, as a social group they experienced a steady decline, as indicated by their dwindling presence in the urban landscape. On occasion those in the inner 'familia circle' may have been considered in the wills of the elite, creating the spectacular examples of social mobility often seen as defining features of Imperial society. Most likely, however, these were relatively rare exceptions to a prevailing pattern of inter-generational property transfer that tended to restrict the circulation of resources to those who were already part of the elite, or who happened to enjoy its particular favour and patronage. 33 In this context the shrinking of the built-up area of Pompeii also attracts attention, since the parts of regions I, II and III, which in later periods had been given over to orchards and vineyards, appear to have been occupied by small 'terrace' houses in the past; cf. Nappo 1997. 34 The celebrated examples of domestic houses transformed into commercial premises (e.g. I 6,7; VI 8,20-21 and VI 14,21-22; cf. Dickmann 2010) may also be the result of property accumulation, perhaps through inheritance. Families already in possession of representative townhouse(s) may plausibly have decided to use new acquisitions to generate income rather than employ them for private habitation. That could be done either in the form of commercial letting or by turning the domus into production sites. Viewed from that perspective, the once popular interpretation of these instances as signs of aristocratic 'decline' appears misguided. APPENDIX 1.

Pompeius Grosphus Gavianus dv. 59 CE). (Hopkins, 1965)(Hopkins, 1965). This model of the curial elite has been explored in greater detail in(Mouritsen, 1988), which presents the relevant evidence. Houses of magistrates and candidates: I 4,5.25 (LL. Popidii Ampliatus and Secundus, 4.2375; The main criterion is inevitably the size of the house, including upper stories and terracing, but the layout is also taken into account, i.e. presence of reception spaces, atria and peristyles. A full list of the houses in the two categories is presented in appendix 2. Some wealthy house owners, such as the freed Vettii, may of course not have been eligible for membership of the ordo, but such anomalous cases probably do not affect our figures substantially. (Mouritsen, 1997) For the most sophisticated version of that argument see(Scheidel, 2006). Cf. also Vittinghoff 1980(Vittinghoff, 1980);(Vittinghoff, 1990)(Pleket, 1990). Both argued for the existence of economically 'middling' groups in Roman society. For example, the owner of the imposing House of the Menander installed a small rented flat over his atrium (I 10,5) and separated another corner of this property off and turned it into an inn (I 10,13); Ling 1997. Even more strikingly, in VIII 4,2-4, whose owner appears to have been the magistrate Q.

    "full_text": "Arctos has been published since 1954, annually from vol. 8 (1974). Arctos welcomes submissions dealing with any aspect of classical antiquity, and the reception of ancient cultures in mediaeval times and beyond. Arctos presents research articles and short notes in the fields of Greek and Latin languages, literatures, ancient history, philosophy, religions, archaeology, art, and society. Each volume also contains reviews of recent books. The website is at www.journal.fi/arctos. In the last decades, the notion of space has been centered in studies on the ancient world, following trends that have been equally influential in the human sciences in general. The aim of this review article is to take stock of this remarkable and growing intellectual turn, its methodologies, theoretical frameworks, topics of interest and future prospects. As a sample, it will analyse a selection of prominent recent works that have introduced the spatial dimension in studies of antiquity and highlight their main contributions and drawbacks. In doing so, it attempts to chart how the toolbox of spatial theories has been used and what the future may hold. The works surveyed are Amy Russell's The politics of public space in Republican Rome (2015), Daniel Gargola's The Shape of the Roman Order: The Republic and Its Spaces (2017), Carlos Machado's Urban Space and Aristocratic Power in Late Antique Rome (AD 270-535) from 2019, and Christopher 1 This research has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 771874) with the ERC CoG project \"Law, Governance and Space: Questioning the Foundations of the Republican Tradition\". The author gratefully acknowledges the invaluable help of Ms Oona Raatikainen and Dr Heta Björklund. He also acknowledges as full disclosure the discussions he has had with two of the authors here reviewed, Russell and Gargola, on the study of space in the Roman world. However, such discussions did not involve the current review nor were they aware of it. He would like to also thank members of the SpaceLaw project for their comments to the manuscript. Roman (Anon, n.d.) This is by no means an exhaustive list, but rather a sample skewed towards my own interests in the spatial representations of the public sphere. However, these studies employ very different approaches and methodological tools. Russell's award-winning work focuses on the public-private distinction in Late Republican Rome with some references to other cities in Italy. The individual chapters concentrate on themes such as the forum, the basilica, sacred spaces and the uses of art in making statements, with a distinct interest in individual agency. In contrast, Gargola seeks to understand how space was conceptualized and how spatial orientation informed and guided action in the Roman republic. Machado's book focuses on senatorial aristocracy in Late Antique Rome, a period in which the retreat of imperial power coincided with the rise of Christianity, a territory already staked by the likes of Peter Brown and Richard Krautheimer. If the emphasis of Russell and Gargola is on the rise and expansion of an imperial capital, Machado looks at a city in decline and abandonment that is also the site of massive ecclesiastical building programs. Machado's work is divided into sections on urban space, the uses of space and the development of private space. Dickenson's book is the most expansive in scope, investigating the evolution of the agora and public space in general in Greece over a period of nearly six centuries. In comparing these works, the aim is primarily in discussing different ways of doing research with the toolbox of spatial theories and the various advantages and drawbacks that they entail. In the following, we will first discuss what the spatial turn is and what it means for investigations into the past. We will explore how these approaches have thus far been used in the study of the ancient world in general. Then, we turn to our sample studies and explore how they position themselves against this background and how they use space and spatiality as tools or even aims. There is no single definition of the spatial turn or how spatial theories are to be used, but there are numerous different sources and methodological foundations. Some of the main sources are the works of Marxist geographers such as Edward Soja, David Harvey and Doreen Massey, who began to investigate how issues such as class could be studied through their spatial manifestations. (Anon, n.d.) One of the basic premises of spatial theories has been a Gramscian notion of structural power. Theories such as those by Michel Foucault or, more specifically, Henri Lefebvre argue that the built environment acts as a kind of petrified social structure. (Anon, n.d.) Within historical studies and studies of space in past societies, there is something of a monotonic focus on using the theories of Henri Lefebvre. One of the most important features of the spatial approach developed by Lefebvre is the focus on how people experienced space and how those experiences differed. His view was that space is not only constructed but also experienced through a social and cultural prism. (Anon, n.d.) In historiography, there are also clear linkages to the Annales school of history, which emphasizes the role of structures and long term (or longue durée) developments such as changes in urban or rural spaces. Thus, seminal texts such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie 's Montaillou (1975) or Fernand Braudel's La Méditerranée (1949) sought to present space as a central factor, or even an actor, in lieu of short-term surface level activities. (Anon, n.d.) Within historical studies, we may group interest in spatial theories as focused on three main aspects: power, symbols and memory. The aspect of power is conceptually fairly self-explanatory as it investigates how power relations may be examined in urban environments and in their usages. For example, palaces have a function of projecting power while public spaces may be used to demonstrate the lack of centralized power or hierarchies. (Anon, n.d.) The symbolic aspect is tied to the aspect of power in that it includes the meanings that are attached to objects such as statues or monuments. Monuments act as placeholders for values, and their prominence is a sign of the esteem in which those values are held, but how the audience, for instance, the people read it and what kinds of emotion they link to it is up to them. (Anon, n.d.) The aspect of memory and the construction of public memory are the final interlinked concepts, i.e., the reference to the past. Pierre Nora's famous idea of the lieux de mémoire is fundamental here as it illustrates how places may be given meanings that are wholly independent of their original function or intent. Nora's work mainly referred to places where historical events took place or where they were believed to have taken place. (Anon, n.d.) A particularly interesting aspect of the use of spatial approaches is the revelatory potential they have with regard to the blind spots of written sources, such as gender or marginalized groups, such as slaves. Their existence and significance can be revealed through their visibility in domestic or communal spaces. (Anon, n.d.) There are equally interesting specific usages of spatial thinking in historical work, such as the theory of the middle ground, initially coined in 1991 by Richard White to illustrate the creative ambiguity and communicative license that enabled peaceable commerce and interaction between indigenous inhabitants and settlers in the Great Lakes area. Striving for mutual accommodation and understanding in this setting, the middle ground became both a term for a geographic area and for the mode of being that sought to avoid domination and marginalization. (Anon, n.d.) In historical studies, the spatial turn is mostly used as a way to gain a novel approach to materiality. It involves emphases on space as the realm of and mirror to power, as the locus of symbols and as the realm of sites of memory and representation. The beginning of the use of the spatial turn in studies on the ancient world in general is difficult to pinpoint since there are numerous alternatives. One could begin with the works of Ray Laurence, especially his Roman Pompeii: Space and Society (1994), which displayed the idea of analyzing urban activities in their spatial context by utilizing the wealth of material from Pompeii. Laurence established connections between activities and movement, the development of the city and its identity, its social and economic spheres and the daily rhythm of life. (Anon, n.d.) Laurence was, or is, part of a larger group of Pompeianists who seek to write the history of Roman urbanism. David Newsome, his doctoral student, has continued his work by studying movement and traffic, while others have expanded into issues such as soundscapes and sightlines. (Anon, n.d.) A methodologically different approach was taken by the practitioners of spatial syntax analysis, such as Michael Anderson, Michael Grahame and Hanna Stoeger, who were inspired by the work of Hillier and Hanson. Their works have utilized computer models to determine how people moved in cities or even in houses. (Anon, n.d.) Another starting point could be the approach taken by Diane Favro. Her studies, primarily Augustan Rome (1996), have explored how ancient Romans experienced their city and its change in the building programs of Augustus. The central concept of her study is the urban image, a concept borrowed from Kevin Lynch's The Image of the City (1960), and its transformation. (Anon, n.d.) In a similar way, recent scholars, such as Harriet Fertik, have explored the way power dynamics are present in spatial environments. (Anon, n.d.) Since Lefebvre is just one of the numerous French theorists on space and spatiality, it comes as no surprise that there are many French applications of (Anon, n.d.) Laurence 1994. Laurence's study coincided with other important works, such as Wallace-Hadrill 1994; Zanker 1998. (Anon, n.d.) Laurence -Newsome 2011. Other Pompeianists that are interested in spatial matters include, e.g., Berry 2007; Flohr 2013; Ellis 2018; Viitanen -Nissin 2017. 14 Hillier -Hanson 1984; Grahame 2000. However, this methodology has received much criticism. See, e.g., Simelius 2018, 42-43. these theories to the study of the ancient world. Therefore, another starting point could be, for example, the work of Claude Nicolet or Mireille Corbier, who have utilized the concepts of power and knowledge in their analysis of the Roman public sphere. (Anon, n.d.) Issues of space have loomed large even in German scholarship. Karl-Joachim Hölkeskamp's studies on the Roman Republic and its public sphere, Annette Haug's work on ancient urbanism and the work of the massive Topoi project (where one needs to mention only Susanne Muth among many) have been hugely significant. (Anon, n.d.) When speaking of an emphasis on space and a spatial view, the question arises whether there is much of a difference between avowedly spatial studies and topographical studies that combined historical and archaeological aspects long before trendy monikers and the invention of the whole concept of a spatial turn. Notable topographical studies have been conducted by household names such as Filippo Coarelli and Mario Torelli. (Anon, n.d.) Naturally, the works mentioned above have mostly been on Roman urbanism. The ancient world was mostly agricultural in nature as has been pointed out in the studies of Diane (Anon, n.d.) Equally important are the emphases on cartography and the conceptualization and visualization of space. These emphases can be found in the works of, for example, Richard Talbert and Kaj Brodersen. (Anon, n.d.) In the same vein, the centrality of Rome needs to be re-evaluated, as is done, for instance, in Hans Beck's work on localism (Localism and the Ancient Greek City-State). There has also been a surge of spatially themed works on ancient Greece. (Anon, n.d.) In this respect, the study of public and private spheres in the ancient world is also interesting. From this aspect, Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, Joanne Berry and many others have studied the experience between domestic and public spheres. The public-private distinction, i.e. the semi-permeable and often confusing line between what may be understood as being in the private sphere and what that meant, is an issue taken up by scholars such as Andrew Riggsby, Annapaola Zaccharia Raggiu and Laura Nissin, among others. (Anon, n.d.) In addition to the works referred to here at length, there are numerous others who taken up the spatial theme have within the last decade. For instance, Michael Scott's Space and society in the Greek and Roman Worlds (2012) utilizes different spatial theories to analyse a series of case studies in ancient Greece and Rome. (Anon, n.d.) One of the most self-conscious, theoretically ambitious works to come out recently is Fitzgerald's and Spentzou's edited volume The Production of Space in Latin Literature (2018), which explores spatial dynamics in Roman literature. Its introduction is a veritable cornucopia of references to seminal works ranging from Lefebvre to Michel de Certeau and Soja. (Anon, n.d.) There is also a clear post-colonial strain of scholarship that challenges the notions prevalent in earlier studies regarding ethnicity. In Britain, for instance, these works have questioned ideas such as the racialized boundaries between Romans and barbarians, leading to heated online conflicts. (Anon, n.d.) In short, there has been a fairly large and diverse output of spatial studies on the ancient Mediterranean world. These studies have bridged the disciplinary boundaries of classics, history and archaeology, although they do demonstrate clear continuities from earlier works. In a number of additional studies, the spatial aspect is almost invisible and is not even mentioned in the titles of these studies. However, very few of these engage with the theory beyond a few footnotes that acknowledge both first and second tier theories before moving to other subjects. Because of the difficulty of distinguishing between studies that merely claim to utilize spatial theories and those that actually do, it is perhaps beneficial to start by discussing the theoretical and methodological foundation of this new crop of studies. Do they simply repackage topographical approaches, or do they achieve something new? The demand of openly stating one's theoretical pedigree may be misleading. As someone once said, it is hardly relevant to spend sixty pages of an introduction to explain what this or that trendy French theorist really meant if one does not actually apply their theories to the sources, to the research material itself. In most of the works mentioned above, the main references are to second tier theories, the field-specific applications of theories such as Lefebvre's. The works at hand may be divided into two groups based on theory: the theoretical introducers and the implicit theory users. Among the first group, Russell has a full section (Russell 2015, 16-24) on methodology that situates her work in relation to the development of spatial theories from Lefebvre onwards, giving theoretical nods to Foucault, Harvey, Soja, Tuan, Rapoport and Casey. She mentions, e.g., Laurence, Spencer, Hillier and Hanson, Favro and others as her predecessors. She describes her approach as behavioral with the aim of tracking ancient behavior since ancient feelings are hard to grasp. She combines Favro's pathways with Riggsby's and Zaccharia Raggiu's behavioral public-private definitions to examine how different actors behaved in public spaces. Machado's section on methodology is fairly developed (Machado 2019, 18-24), but he begins by referring primarily to great names from topographical studies, such as Coarelli or Zanker. Of the first level theorists in geography and cultural studies, Charles Withers and Michel de Certeau are mentioned in addition to the almost compulsory reference to Lefebvre. Machado also has a productive way of explaining parallels. For example, when discussing imperial visits to households, he compares them to Elizabethan England and the way that royal visits shaped the political geography of Tudor England (Machado 2019, 228), or when he discusses the public functions of domestic places by Romans in comparison to that of Indian local administrators during the Raj (Machado 2019, 252-53). (Anon, n.d.) In contrast, implicit theory users rely more on doing than showing. Since Gargola's interest is in the conceptualization of space, it would be reasonable to assume that his methodological apparatus would be different from others. Of course, many of his references are to studies on constitutionalism and constitutional law, but even he is not immune to the necessary reference to Lefebvre (in the French original) as well as to Hillier and Hanson. What he does add is a reference to anthropological work, primarily M. E. Bloch. All in all, Gargola's theoretical framework is mostly one that is assumed rather than explained, outlined as it is in just a single page (Gargola 2017, 2). Dickenson also includes his share of Lefebvre, but not in his section on methodology per se. Instead, methodological observations and references to the main exemplars of earlier literature are located in the \"previous literature\" section (Dickenson 2016, 16-31). Though he does not cite much theory, key concepts that he uses, such as experienced space, betray at least a second-hand reading of the geographical theory. However, he approvingly cites Alcock on the lack of suitably preserved sites in Greece that would enable the kind of \"hi-tec spatial analysis\" (Dickenson 2016, 22) that has been done, for instance, in Pompeii. While the aims of these works are quite different, their stated theoretical allegiances are remarkably similar. Thus, Russell discusses behavior within spaces, Gargola analyses how space and the things in it were conceived of and Machado examines how history happens in urban spaces. Dickinson, for his part, is primarily interested in spaces and only secondarily in what happened in them. This difference is mostly due to main sources that each scholar uses. Dickinson focuses on archaeological remains, while the others rely more on written sources. This brings us to our next issue: the field of study. Disciplinary alignment still plays a crucial role even in our inter-, post-and transdisciplinary times. Institutional affiliation and cited and emulated research often reveal what field of study the author thinks his or her research belongs to. As mentioned above, Dickenson's book is quite easily and clearly categorized as archaeology. The others fall within different types of history or classical scholarship in general. Gargola's study is the clearest historical work of them all with its classicist emphasis on language. His emphasis is on how the outside world is conceptualized and understood through the Roman political, conceptual and legal framework. Machado's study is also very historical. His characters move in the spaces of Late Antique Rome rather than in the city itself, and decline/transformation of Rome becomes an actor in its own sense. Russell's work situates itself as history, both political and feminist, but in practice, it falls within the topographical approaches of combining written and archaeological sources. Even though such a distinction of disciplinarity is easy to make, it does not mean that it is self-evident. All works belong to a group whose authors could easily find a home within a traditional classics department and therefore to a larger inbetweenness of ancient studies writ large. Are they interested in the spatial aspects of politics, economy, religion and social relations? The onus of each book reveals its stated allegiances. Most studies on Roman public space are focused on politics. Economic interests are rare outside of works on space that are specifically focused on economics, such as the studies by Ellis and Flohr mentioned above. Religion and social relations have a similar specialist tendency. Typically, studies on religious space concentrate on religious change and promotion, and studies on social change focus on the domestic sphere or marginalized groups. Dickenson's study is the most politically minded of them all in its interest in upper level developments. The characters he deals with are rulers, cities and states, with the individual and her life far from the focus. The economic aspect, quite significant in relation to the agora, receives little attention. For Machado, all of these facets of life are basically the same: politics, economy, religion and social relations represent different aspects of the playing field of the aristocratic competition. Thus, even developments in the domestic sphere, such as the gradual disappearance of the aristocratic domus, are fundamentally issues of economic and political change. Even for studies that attempt to approach the activities taking place in the private sphere, it remains difficult due to the emphasis of the literary sources on the public arenas. Gargola's approach is basically a combination of political and legal history in which religion and social relations matter mostly for their influence on political history, particularly in public rituals and ceremonies. However, he does discuss how the individual acted in the framework provided by different rules. Russell's emphasis, clearly to her dislike, is on the elite men who dominated the public sphere and political life of the Roman republic and on the sources that we have of them. Economy is largely absent, but cultic life and social relations have a central role, although they are viewed only through the lens of the elite men and their activities in the public space. The different emphases on the smaller or larger scale of things are, of course, often contingent on the content of the sources, but more importantly, they are dictated by the stated or unstated practice of writing about the past. Studies on the ancient world are, by their very nature, dependent on the sources, on their availability and character. This means that, while one would want to hear a plurality of voices, sometimes those voices cannot really be heard, and the questions that emerge from reading modern theories remain unanswered. The way that space is understood and conceptualized is another major distinguishing factor. Is space seen as static or fluid? Is it an arena where things happen or a place defined by movement, memories or traditions? This is a remarkably interesting way of looking at an author's analytical process. This is also an aspect of research in which disciplinary focus leads to startlingly different results. Dickenson's space is the built environment, the agoras of Greek cities, which appear almost completely depopulated in comparison to the others' concepts of space. His focus is on buildings, their history and function. If Dickenson's starting point is existing remains and his focus is to reveal their development and functions, the others are more interested in the actor's perspective. Gargola tries to understand space as the Romans conceived of it, how they thought about it, and how it influenced and informed their polity and its change. His notion of space is deeply constructivistic, where both the polity that is Rome and the groups and individuals that comprise of it make their own space and time in the sense that it is formed by \"their movements, their experience, their memories and their traditions. \" According to Gargola, \"Romans viewed their political order spatially through the lens provided by their city and its magistrates\" (Gargola 2017, 224). The outside world was where magistrates operated, signalled by their departures and arrivals, their preparation to take action or their return in triumph. There was a clear bifurcation between the city, with its clear rules, and the set boundaries and space beyond, where rules mattered little, except for the roads that tied them to Rome. If Gargola seeks to find out how Romans thought about space, Russell's stated emphasis is on movement in spaces. She dwells on how building is used to alter the dynamics of space and power, for example, when Pompey was forced to return home when the Senate took to its chambers (because he was not a member) led Pompey to build his own curia for the Senate. Russell's enduring interest is in the public/private dichotomy and in its construction through a cross-historical understanding. Machado's view of power dynamics and their representations are almost Foucauldian: \"Just as the power of a late Roman senator was of a very different magnitude from that of Roman emperors (or, later, Ostrogothic kings), houses and places were political centres of different scales\" (Machado 2019, 252). The insides of houses and palaces were sets that operated as props in which actions took place, persons were hidden from pursuers, and imperial hierarchies were reinforced through the acts of ordering and waiting. The way that space is approached and conceptualized is revealing even when it is given very little attention. For example, Eva-Maria Lackner's monumental study of the Republican fora discusses at length the role of architecture in the creation of communities and their political ideologies. As Baker put it in his review, \"fora ultimately became a medium that both cultivated and reinforced social rules and relationships in the Republican period. \" However, Lackner does not explicitly elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings of this argument.foot_21 This is typical of works that are deeply embedded in a disciplinary foundation, or worse, in a practical description in which the meaning of methodological reflection is buried behind practice. Aspects of gender and the discussion on groups apart from the elite male worldview have been some of the great promises of novel methodologies, whether they be critical Marxist social sciences or studies on race or gender. This is one of the reasons why I was quite excited about reading the works through this lens. However, it was not to be. In movies or other works of fiction, the Bechdel test of female characters asks whether there is a scene in which two female characters talk with each other and do not talk about a man. If these books were made into movies, they would all fail this test. As a work that explicitly defines itself as feminist, Russell's book attempts to rise above the male-dominated written sources, but moments of frustration shine through: \"we are forced to search for any scrap of evidence for the experience or even the presence of women\" (Russell 2015, 179). Gargola and Machado do not deal with women except as statisticians. The same may be said of Dickinson. Of course, public space is stereotypically a field from which women are often assumed to be excluded, and Roman sources quite explicitly state that they are. The cornerstone of this assertion is the jurist Ulpian's statement in this regard in Digest 50,17,2. However, in both social and legal historical studies on women in the economic and social worlds, this assertion has been clearly demonstrated to be false in the lived experience. Why is this then the case in studies on public space? Discussing space with mere words is a futile exercise. Images feed the imagination of the reader and enable the message to be conveyed much more effectively, especially when that message seeks to repeal firmly held underlying assumptions. The use of images is also a question of emphasis. Social scientists using quantitative data or even historians of demography tend first to look at tables in an article since they are of primary interest to them. The same can be said of figures and maps for historians of architecture. Though her work is primarily based on written sources, Russell attempts to use illustrations and maps for more than just pictures. There are three purpose-made maps of Rome and its forum and a total of 21 illustrations featuring architectural reconstructions, photographs of sites, coins, paintings and the like. Most of the reconstructions are reproductions, with some original works. Despite this effort, the narrative is clearly based on texts and reliant on the written sources. The other Classics/historical studies have the same trait. Machado's book has an almost equal amount of illustrations, containing 2 maps and 21 reconstructions or photographs. They are all reproductions of illustrations that have previously appeared elsewhere. Gargola has a total of six maps, all of which are made for his volume. However, even the most archaeologically disposed of the lot is primarily based on text. Dickenson has the most plentiful set of illustrations, with 51 maps, pictures, reconstructions and other images, but most of them are repurposed material from earlier studies. In comparison to earlier works, such as Favro's Urban Image, which have attempted to integrate images to make the argument, the use of second-hand illustrations is a slight disappointment. While Favro, in the style of architects, emphasizes illustrations and conveys her argument through them, the four authors discussed here use images as secondary material to illustrate the text. The works discussed here have been published within the last four years by the time of writing, and thus, in the glacial pace of academic publishing, should be considered the latest word. Regarding future prospects, there are also numerous ongoing book projects and conferences that will undoubtedly bring new inspiration. (Anon, n.d.) Based on the works at hand and the knowledge of the ongoing projects, what is the future of spatial studies on the ancient world? What I have learned in my earlier inquiries into the history of science is that, like the Newtonian laws of motion, scientific inquiry has inertia that slows down the adoption of new ways, but that inertia also keeps it moving once in motion. In his keynote address at the Auckland conference on space and ancient studies in January 2020, Ray Laurence envisioned how the language of space is reproduced across the Roman Empire and discoverable in almost every aspect such as epigraphy, language or architecture. What are then the theoretical and practical issues that have not yet been tackled and which of them could prove to be useful in the coming years? Of the issues that have been discussed in spatial theory, many have been incorporated in works on the ancient world, for instance, spatial representations, the discussion on movement and access, ideas on perception and the way it has been conditioned. Even the notions of rhythm and temporality have gained some attention. When speaking of future directions, one is always in danger of selfobsession, of raising only one's own ideas as the way forward. What I will attempt to avoid is just that, at least to some extent, and instead focus on some of the potential avenues to be explored, based on an admittedly shallow understanding of space and spatiality. There are two larger aspects on which I would like to focus: the theoretical and the practical. Within theoretical discussions about the ancient world and spatiality, the concept of space is used in a very general sense as I have hopefully demonstrated. This has led to some ambiguities, for instance, in the potentially fruitful distinction between \"hard\" infrastructure logistics and \"soft\" imaginations and their spatiality. Especially in the Roman world, with the Roman habit of projecting power through both infrastructure, such as roads and military installations, and the Roman appeal to the imaginary, this distinction could yield interesting results. Another undiscussed issue is the separation of space and place, with regard to which there has been an immense theoretical debate, which has rarely been communicated to ancient studies, for instance in the sense of place-making as a form of cultural meaning-creation. (Anon, n.d.) On the theoretical side, numerous analytical tools have yet to have larger purchase, let alone practical application. While their effects have certainly been noted, the distinctions on scope and scale have not been addressed. On the issue of scale, for example, ideas of locality could be complemented with notions of verticality. Theories of flat ontologies, which maintain that objects that are imagined may be as \"real\" in their being as physical objects, could be put to use in analyses as the ancient world had an immensely rich sense of objects that inhabited mostly or only the shared imagination, for instance, in myth and religion. Equally, the actor-network theory, or ANT, which examines things primarily through their relations to each other, has yet to receive much attention. (Anon, n.d.) Since the move out of essentializing models in understanding culture has strengthened, it is important for a matching a move to take place away from essentializing definitions of spaces and toward recognizing the plurality that the ancient world exhibited, as has occurred in anthropology. (Anon, n.d.) Due to the political focus of much of our sources, topology or the relative or flexible notions of geography could be very interesting for the analysis of how power distorts, stretches and obscures distance and relations between places. To borrow a term from social sciences, locating regimes had a pervasive impact on the ancient world, which means that spatial logic was backed by power. (Anon, n.d.) Another approach of great potential in ethnographic research is the use of feminist geography, or the general focus on the marginalized, such as immigrants or asylum seekers. 34 This is an area in which the silence of written sources can be complemented by material finds, but such approaches are not easy as Russell's example demonstrates. A similar possibility is the utilization of practice theory, for instance, Schatzki's theory of social sites. Social sites are places in which social orders, practices, agency and daily social life happens, and practice theory allows us to understand the interlinkages between these constitutive factors that underlie so much of the activities in public places. (Anon, n.d.) When discussing public spaces, there is a wealth of theoretical and practical work that could be mined for insights. The legal, social, political and symbolic ownership of public places and the private infringement on them is a theme that has resonance both in ancient and contemporary studies. The notion of public space as political space, both as a space of deliberative action but also of insurgence, is something that could be fruitfully theorized across the temporal spectrum. Access to public space and its restrictions as well as the potential for interaction can be approached from different angles, from boundaries that are physical, social, symbolic or legal. These boundaries may exist for some and not 31 Much of the attention that it has received may be traced back to the work of Bruno Latour. (Anon, n.d.) For an introduction to topology, see Paasi 2011. (Anon, n.d.) Mountz 2011. (Anon, n.d.) for others, as plural, porous or blurred. (Anon, n.d.) All of this is, as a phenomenon, readily familiar to those interested in Roman or Greek public spaces, the fora and the agora, and in the ways that access to them was controlled. A practical theme that could have significance is the use of imagining. Especially in Roman archaeology, the use of GIS, photogrammetry and 3D applications has become commonplace, but their implications for research have yet to be fully realized. The new Virtual Modeling of the Great Marble Map of Rome project on the Forma Urbis is a good example of the possibilities that are open. (Anon, n.d.) As is obvious from the four books and their illustrations as well as almost all other recent books on the topic, very little truly new work has been conducted in images. At this point, the frustrated classicist or classical archaeologist may wonder what practical benefit the theoretical emphasis may bring. We have archaeological sites and their study, but these do not enable the voices of the inhabitants or the users to inform us about what they thought about space, or if there are voices, we cannot really ask questions that they do not answer. At the opposite end of the spectrum, we are in possession of texts that recount movement in spaces that, quite often, we know next to nothing of. Again, we cannot do surveys or ask the ancient Greeks to fill out questionnaires. During the last three decades, the spatial turn has become a household term in studies on the ancient world. In the four recent works that were discussed here, it is simultaneously apparent how much the issue of space has become a key analytical tool for understanding the public sphere in the ancient world as well as how much work there is still to be done. While some of the theorists discussed above have a tendency to write vacuous prose that is very hard to understand unless one is really passionate about critical theory, there is usually a point buried under the references to Deleuze. Quite often, theory helps to point out interesting junctures and gain a sensibility of phenomena that have earlier been overlooked. (Anon, 2015)(Anon, 2017)(Anon, 2019)(Anon, 2016) The standard history may be read in works such as Arias -Warf 2009. For a short introduction to Harvey's multi-layered thinking on the concept of space, see(Anon, 2004) Especially famous examples are the coercive uses of space such as the Panopticon.(Anon, 1977) (Anon, 1991). On Lefebvre, see Merrifield 2006. Both Le Roy Ladurie and Braudel have had a later resurgence due to translations into other languages. These constitute the first generation of studies (the \"Monuments of Power\" style), which explore in a Foucauldian manner how constructed space may be used for social control and coercion. Boschung -Hölkeskamp -Sode 2015. Nora 1984Nora -1992. . This is something that followed directly from the Marxist roots of the theory, but as Russell demonstrates, following up on this idea is not simple. However, F.

    "title": "Patrons and Clients in Roman Pompeii -Social Control in the Cityscape and City Blocks?",
    "abstract": "Roman society was strongly hierarchical in nature and the status of a person was visible in many ways from items of clothing to the address where one lived. The dominance of the upper classes over the rest of society can be traced in well-preserved Roman cities such as Pompeii. By examining where the large dwellings were located and what kind of activities can be found around them, we can analyse how the rich and the powerful controlled the city. At the level of an individual city block, a study of the arrangements that connected adjacent housing units in one way or another allows us to sketch possible property boundaries. This provides a means to deepen our understanding of social dominance, control, and dependence. It is shown that the social, economic, and political dominance of the Pompeian upper class had an impact on the everyday life of their dependents, and that the lower classes could watch over the elite, too, as various social groups lived side by side in Pompeii.",
    "full_text": "Human beings are tied to each other by a multitude of social relations that organise and manifest themselves in various ways. Roman society was divided into numerous groups and classes including patricians and plebeians, landowning elite and urban poor, citizens and slaves. hese groups of people mark the separation of those who have from those who have not and give support to claims that it is exploitation and opportunity hoarding that drive societies to install boundaries and construct hierarchical organisations (Anon, n.d.). Consequently, political and economic means most oten determined a person's place and status in Roman society. Many of the relationships between individuals of diferent social groups were formalised in varying ways. A person's social status could be visible, for ex-ample, in dress (e.g. (Edmondson, 2008) or in his/her actions such as the morning salutatio ritual where patrons were visited by their clients daily (e.g. Goldbeck 2010). he possibility for social closure and exclusion is efective in solving organisational problems (Anon, n.d.). he Roman social relations were maintained for the most part by resorting to self-help, for instance, in solving crimes and dealing with social unrest. As a result, Romans developed only few formal ways of social control, surveillance, and policing themselves. During the Republic, some local magistrates had duties that resemble those of the modern police forces (Anon, 1988). here was, however, a tendency to use military personnel as police during the irst centuries (Anon, n.d.) of the Empire (Fuhrmann, 2010). he desire to control individuals and crowds increased with time, which is visible also in public architecture: the original forum or central square of all Roman towns was open on all sides, but later examples in the city of Rome, for instance, had restricted access by doorways (Fredrick, 2003). he ways in which social relations were manifested in Roman cityscapes have not been studied despite the widely spread \"spatial turn\" in the study of Roman archaeology and history starting from the 1990s (e.g. (Newsome, 2011)). One of the reasons for this lack could be the diiculty of connecting the literary sources to the archaeological evidence. Most of the texts concern the city of Rome, whose archaeology is poorly known beyond the monumental buildings. Instead, Pompeii, a small town located in Campania south of Rome and destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79, has most oten been used to explore social relations. Its excellent preservation and the wide extent of the excavated area ofer a unique opportunity to study daily life in the Roman Empire. However, Pompeii is not Rome and it is not certain that the social habits and rituals recorded for the capital were also known and actively used in a small provincial town. It has been suggested, for instance, that salutatio would have been geographically restricted mostly to the city of Rome (Anon, n.d.). he inscriptions made on stone and electoral notices painted on the house facades give clues as to who belonged to the political elite of Pompeii, but otherwise there are only a few texts directly concerned with how diferent social groups related to each other. Based on what is known of government in Roman towns, and on the basis of the principles behind social inequality outlined above, the most powerful form of control in Pompeii was probably that conducted by its citizens: informal self-help control based on the social, political, and economic status of individuals. he wax tablets found in the house of a rich banker, Caecilius Iucundus, ofer clues to the social hierarchy as they record inancial transactions signed and veriied by other individuals in order of their social status (Anon, 1974)(Anon, n.d.). Changes in the social composition of the city's inhabitants have been suggested based on epigraphical evidence (Castrén 1975, but see also (Mouritsen, 1988)(Anon, n.d.) for criticism and diferent interpretations). Archaeology has not been used much in these studies despite attempts to identify house owners (Della Corte 1965; for criticism see (Anon, n.d.)(Allison, 2001). However, some hypotheses on social relations visible in the cityscape have been presented. It has been suggested that the Pompeian elite lived in secluded areas, away from the crowds and socially suspicious establishments such as bars, taverns, and brothels (Anon, 1995)(Anon, n.d.). hese analyses are based on literary sources and explore the distribution of the deviant establishments, but the locations of the dwellings of the elite or where other inhabitants of Pompeii lived are not discussed. Literary sources can be also used to illustrate the elite's wish to place their dwellings in busy streets for visibility and accessibility (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Moreover, recent studies have shown that the distribution of retail of food, drink, and even sex can be explained with economic causes (Ellis, 2004)(Ellis, 1979)(Anon, 2002). he basic question remains: can social relations between elite and non-elite and social control be observed in the archaeology of Pompeii? City planning and architecture guide human behaviour and give clues as to where certain activities take place (Lawrence & Low, 1990)) -many of the spatial elements of social actions can be traced in the cityscape of Pompeii. We aim to study how diferent social groups were visible in the cityscape of Pompeii and how the locations of social control occurred in Pompeii on two levels: irstly citywide and secondly inside one city block. he irst part takes a look at the distributions of diferent kinds of dwellings and various social and commercial activities. he second part explores means of social and economic control at the micro level, between individual houses in city block IX.3 located in the geographical centre of Pompeii. his dual approach gives grounds for interpreting the role and forms of social control in the daily life of the Pompeians and showing that both large-scale and small-scale studies are vital in answering our question. Pompeii's visible grid plan was formed mostly in the 3rd-2nd centuries BC, according to the most recent interpretations (e.g. (Coarelli, 2007)(Anon, n.d.). It represents a variation of the classical grid plan where the uneven topography has dictated the placing of the main streets and the shapes of the city blocks between them (Holappa & Viitanen 2011). Most of the administrative public buildings around the forum are located in the western part of town, whereas the theatres are located in the southern part and the amphitheatre is in the eastern part (Fig. 1). he excavations in the south-eastern part of Pompeii have also revealed that many city blocks were used as gardens and vineyards (e.g. (Anon, 1979). When the various workshops and shops are plotted on the plan of Pompeii, an industrial and commercial zone can be outlined in the centre of the town (e.g. Laurence 2007:Map 4.7): most of the workshops are located within two blocks on both sides of the main north-south street of the city. It has also been suggested that the north-western part of Pompeii would have been mostly residential in character (e.g. (Schoonhoven, 1999)). However, it is not possible to demonstrate functional zoning inside the town apart from these general notions (cf. (Raper, 1977)(Anon, 1992). he city blocks were divided into plots that were eventually illed with houses, and in AD 79 the town was densely built and inhabited. he similar sizes of the city blocks and the building plots inside them (e.g. (Anon, 2006)) suggest a rather egalitarian thinking behind the land survey plan (cf. Sewell 2010 on the establishment of Roman colonies in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC). here was little control over the land use of individual proprietors, which probably resulted in the observed mixed use of space (Anon, n.d.) with only minor evidence for zoning (Raper, 1977). he grid plan of Pompeii or its planning do not provide signs of taking control of the population or of social relations in general. On the other hand, it demonstrates a desire to control crowds. he clustering of public buildings and other places where crowds were likely to gather shows that the planners of the grid plan were aware of the need to create spaces MASF 2, 2014, 141-155 covers most of the city area, but is concentrated especially in the north-western and southern parts (Fig. 2). here are relatively few dwellings in the eastern part of the city, as well as around the forum in the western part. he areas where crowds were likely to gather, such as those around the forum, the theatres, and the amphitheatre, were clearly avoided when it was decided where to place dwellings. he main entrances of particularly the large dwellings usually open to the main streets, particularly those starting from the gates. On the main streets, the prestigious houses are lanked by shops, workshops, and bars, and the kind of seclusion suggested by earlier research does not seem to occur (cf. (Viitanen et al., 2012). It has been suggested that the elite would have preferred to live near the forum in order to create a connection between themselves and the prestigious religious, political, and commercial centre of the town (Anon, n.d.). However, in Pompeii, mostly only public and commercial buildings can be found in the city blocks adjacent to the forum and dwellings were placed slightly further away. Although this distribution represents the last phase of Pompeii in the late 1st century AD, the locations of the prestigious houses do not seem to have changed considerably compared to the 1st century BC (e.g. Dickmann 1999:Abb. 38). Discerning dwellings from shops in the cityscape was made possible by using distinct architectural clues (cf. (Anon, n.d.)(Helg, 2008). he facades of the city blocks form long, continuous wall surfaces, but the doorways to dwellings and workshops/shops were built in diferent ways. he entrances to shops were usually fairly low and wide, whereas the doorways to large dwellings were oten narrower, but high and accentuated with such architectural elements as columns, steps up, or relief stucco decorations. he for certain activities even though zoning in the modern sense did not exist. he public spaces placed in the grid plan aforded opportunities for the various social groups to meet, but the plan did not segregate them. he basic elements in the grid plan are the city blocks, which were further divided into dwellings, workshops, and shops, and sometimes included even public buildings. Determining where members of diferent social groups lived indicates how integrated or separated these groups were. However, deining which of the houses were used primarily as dwellings is not an easy task even in Pompeii. Productive and commercial activities can be associated even with some of the largest and most lavishly decorated houses (cf. Dickmann 2010; Flohr 2011). Classiications have been made based on house size and structure of the ground plan (presence of atrium and/or peristyle), as well as quantity and quality of decorative elements (especially (Anon, 1994)(Robinson, 1997)(Anon, n.d.). We decided to use Astrid Schoonhoven's catalogue, as it is the only one that covers almost all the buildings in Pompeii -she let out the houses at the western and southern edges, but they are included here (Anon, 2006). Four distinct classes could be discerned, starting with simple one-room houses and ending with the lavish dwellings covering almost entire city blocks (Table 1). he lowermost classes usually consist of workshops and/or shops and could also include living space. he rest are more clearly dwellings where the owner was able to invest in decoration and amenities improving the comfort of living. he distribution of the more certain dwellings SOUNDS LIKE THEORY sidewalks were managed by the owners of the houses, and their building technique and consequently appearance would change when one passed the area of one property and entered another (Saliou, 1999). From the point of view of social control, the dispersed distribution of the large dwellings afords better possibilities for monitoring neighbourhoods than secluded elite residential areas. Visibility and openness of the house were expected of the elite (e.g. (Anon, n.d.), and they could be controlled by the non-elite when the dwellings were located in the same streets. he distribution of dwellings, shops, and workshops displays spatial integration of the Pompeian population, not segregation of various social groups. Many archaeological remains of communal and commercial activities can be found distributed along the streets of Pompeii: crossroad shrines, water fountains, benches, shops, bars, taverns, brothels, and prostitute's cribs. Some are located in the street space and some open to the streets. In the absence of centrally control-led zoning and land use, their placement probably depended on many factors, such as real and/or perceived demand for services, traditions, or the wishes of individuals, particularly land owners. We plotted the various elements onto a map of Pompeii to see how they related to each other (Fig. 3; 4). Crossroads shrines (47 based on Van Andringa 2000) used in the cult of Lares Compitales and public water fountains (45 based on Jansen 2002) connected to Pompeii's water mains are two elements previously used to reconstruct neighbourhoods or vici (Anon, n.d.). Roman towns were divided into vici, and each vicus had a cult, shrine, and magistrates of its own (Anon, 2004)). his division was probably manifested in the distribution of the shrines and fountains (Fig. 3; (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In Pompeii, both are located mostly along the main streets and they can usually be found near crossroads. It is not known how the places of the shrines were selected, but the evidence suggests that they were not in central locations in the neighbourhood, but more likely at their boundaries (Anon, n.d.). Most of the shrines were built on the perimeter walls MASF 2, 2014, 141-155 of the city blocks, and they are usually located in connection with shop doorways (18 out of 47) or public buildings (10 out of 47). Ten shrines can be found in connection with private dwellings, usually large ones. he locations of the fountain basins were partly dictated by the main pipelines, but their inal distribution was fairly even (cf. Eschebach 1979:Abb. 8) -gaps can be found only in the north-western and south-eastern parts of Pompeii. he distribution of the shrines and fountains closely resembles the distribution of dwellings seen earlier (Fig. 2), and it is clear that they were intended to serve the regular inhabitants of Pompeii. During the Late Republican period the vici in Rome had been an essential part of the political unrest. he Augustan reorganisation tied the neighbourhood activities to the imperial administration and cult in an efort to control them more eiciently (Anon, n.d.). he vici were probably involved in political activity in Pompeii, as suggested by their names used in electoral notices supporting candidates (Anon, n.d.). he persons responsible for the neighbourhood organisationmagistri vici -were usually non-elite, for example freedmen and their descendants (Anon, n.d.). In Pompeii, the fountains and shrines suggest a neighbourhood division (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), which always included also large dwellings, possibly indicating elite interest in the neighbourhood activities. However, the element of control over the movements and gatherings of the non-elite is not very obvious. he third element in the streetscape is masonry benches (100 based on (Hartnett, 2008), which can be found built along the street facades particularly in the western part of town. hey have traditionally been interpreted as waiting areas for clients visiting their patrons, but only half of them can be associated with entrances to large dwellings. he rest are beside shop doorways or connected with public buildings. hey do not seem to have a very clear connection with the shrines or the fountains either. hey are usually located on the side of the street that has the most shadow, making them suitable for resting pleasantly under the hot Campanian sun (Anon, n.d.). he benches have been regarded as signs of elite dwellings, but their distribution and associations with all kinds of house units suggests that they were used in various other ways as well. he decision to build them was made by the owner of the house, and they aforded chances for people to meet and gather in more comfort than merely standing in the street (cf. (Hartnett, 2008). he rest of the activities -shops, bars (154 based (Ellis, 2004)(Ellis, 1979), and prostitute's cribs (46 based on McGinn 2002; Guzzo & Scarano Ussani 2009) -are not located directly in the street (Fig. 4). However, they are closely connected with what happens in the street, as some of these establishments attracted drunkenness, rows, and gambling extending from the house into its surroundings. hey are located in very similar locations as the more acceptable elements in the streetscape: in the main streets starting from the gates and close to the crossroads. Prostitute's cribs are oten connected with bars in the crossroads, but most of them tend to be slightly removed from the main streets (Anon, n.d.). he locations of these activities are easily explained with economic reasons: the main streets and crossroads attracted most of the vehicular and pedestrian traic and brought customers. However, it is striking that there are only a few bars or shops in the areas of public buildings in the south-western and south-eastern parts of the city (cf. (Anon, n.d.). he distribution of the commercial establishments closely resembles the distribution of the dwellings -their services were directed to the inhabitants of the city and they were located where the people lived. he largest and the most lavishly decorated dwellings -the houses where the Pompeian elite were likely to live -are almost invariably located in the streets where there was plenty of activity. he bars and other suspicious elements were located right next to the prestigious houses and it was not possible to reach the entrances to these large dwellings without passing bars. he integrated distribution of dwellings, locations of neighbourhood activities, and retail outlets allowed the elite to oversee what happened in the immediate vicinity of their house. he last category of evidence in the city-wide analysis consists of the thousands of painted electoral announcements and inscribed graiti which have been recorded on the facades of Pompeian city blocks. heir distributions have previously been studied by counting messages per facade or street metre, and the results have been used to assess the representativeness of the material or mobility in the streets (Mouritsen, 1988):Fig. 3, Maps 6.5-6.8; Laurence 2007:109-113). We analysed the exact locations of the texts in three areas of Pompeii to see what the contexts can tell us about why and for whom the texts were written (Fig. 5). Two of these, the north-western and southern parts of town, are mostly residential in character, and the third area around the forum features more public buildings. he general distribution of the texts follows the locations of the active streets (e.g. Mouritsen 1988:Fig. 3), conirming the impression gained from other evidence: no audience, no advertisements. he texts tend to cluster in certain parts of the facades, usually near doorways, and the analysis of house types connected with texts shows that roughly half of them (755 of some 1400) were found on the facades of the large dwellings. he modest shop-houses outnumber the large dwellings almost 3 to 1 (461 and 146 respectively) and feature most of the bars and shops that attracted crowds. Despite this, more texts occur on the dwelling facades. he owners apparently had an active role in promoting electoral candidates (Anon, n.d.). he graiti scribbled on the walls could very well be imagined to have been written by visitors waiting to enter the house, perhaps in connection with similar formalised social rituals as the salutatio described for the city of Rome. Even if the morning salutatio mentioned in written sources would have been restricted to the city of Rome and its elite, this evidence suggests that similar practices probably existed in the small provincial towns. he tradition of SOUNDS LIKE THEORY patronage was rooted deeply in Roman society (e.g. (Anon, 1982). he owners of the large dwellings were probably able to control, at least partly, the movements of the persons who had relationships with them -the patron-client relationships are always between unequals (Anon, n.d.). he salutatio in Rome took place in the morning (Goldbeck 2010:106-146), and social rituals in Pompeii could have happened on a similar timetable. A powerful individual could also take up the time of his client for most of the day, as clients were expected to follow their patrons during the performance of their daily activities, for instance, at the forum or even during the visit to the bath, if so required (Anon, n.d.). he distribution of the wall inscriptions particularly on the facades of the large dwellings afords a map of the active, powerful, and socially connected owners. he streets in front of these houses and their entrances were places where the clients gathered, and the crowds and the texts displayed the social connections and the inluence of the owner. We now turn to the locations and means of social control inside city blocks and start by looking at ownership in general. What if the above-discussed pattern of large elite residences surrounded by shops results from not only economic reasons but also the common ownership of these units? Hence the elite would have beneitted from the visibility of their property and its integration with the city's active areas not only in social terms but also in an economic sense: the more buying customers and respect-paying associates they could attract, the greater was the potential for also their own proit. While this possibility seems lucrative, we need further evidence to validate it. A means for examining the common ownership of adjacent units is to look for architectonic clues. Connective internal doorways are the most obvious clue, but there are other structures that cross the perimeter walls -clear property boundaries -and imply common ownership. For example, it has been argued that common ownership may be detectable through mapping parallel alignments of properties, similar building techniques and materials, continuous pavements and curb-stones, and shared structures or facade treatments (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). However, shared utilities do not attest to common ownership by default. Roman law involved a device, servitude, which enabled adjacent properties to share the use of some of their structures (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). We might therefore be dealing with not only ownership but legally binding co-operation among neighbouring units belonging to different owners. hrough examining the whole body of archaeological data, we can generate an aggregate understanding of the relationship between adjacent units and give a well-grounded view on their connections as stemming from mutual agreement or ownership (Ynnilä, 2012). If several structures are shared by two neighbours, we are more likely to deal with common ownership than with complex servitudinal arrangements, as these were potential causes of legal conlict and neigbourhood quarrel. MASF 2, 2014, 141-155 The Ownership of City Block IX.3 Because the examination of shared structures among adjacent units requires meticulous studies of the available data, it is best to approach the question of common ownership through a case study. City block IX.3 is located at the geographic heart of the city (Fig. 1), and since 2002 it has been studied by a team named Expeditio Pompeiana Universitatis Helsingiensis (Anon, 2002)(Anon, n.d.)(Castrén, 2008). In AD 79, the city block examined here contained nineteen units ranging from one-room shops to large elite dwellings (Fig. 6). Although the units contain no connective doorways, there is evidence that some of them shared structures that crossed their boundaries, thus indicating co-operation among adjacent units. hese include at least windows, water pipes, drainage channels, and cess pools (Fig. 7). Moreover, according to the principles of Roman jurisdiction, supericies solo cedit, meaning that what stands on the land goes with it, and hence the proprietor of the ground loor also owned the upper loors (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). It follows that if a house extended over its neighbour, they must have been owned by the same proprietor. What Figure 7 clearly shows is that some units shared structures frequently, while others had only one shared structure or none at all. For example, Units 3 and 5 shared light and a cess pool. Moreover, their upper loors extended above the ground loor of Unit 4, and Unit 5's upper loor extended above the ground loor of Unit 6. his strongly suggests their common ownership. In a similar manner, Units 17, 18, and 19-20 had several shared utilities in AD 79. Firstly, the upper loor of Unit 19-20 extended over Unit 17. Secondly, light was shared between these two. hirdly, all three units probably shared water supply and drainage. Again, these arrangements are best explained as a result of common ownership. common ownership of adjacent units needed not be a permanent arrangement. On the contrary, the ownership of units could have changed hands from time to time, with parts of property sold of and new being made. Such processes seem to have taken place in city block IX.3. For instance, Units 14, 15, and 16 had once probably belonged together. his is indicated by their location \"inside each other\" and a number of closed doorways in their partition walls (Fig. 8). In AD 79, the continued common ownership of Units 16 and 15 can be suggested on the basis of stairs extending to the space above Unit 15 from Unit SOUNDS LIKE THEORY 16. Likewise, although Units 7, 8, and 9 were \"carved out\" of Unit 10-12, there is not enough evidence to conirm that they were all under common ownership in AD 79. Only Unit 9 probably belonged to Unit 10-12, which extended above it. Instead, only light was deinitely shared between Units 7 and 10-12, but this may have been due to a light servitude between the two. Indeed, windows between two units that had no other structures to indicate further connections are common in the city block. hey are found between Units 1-2 and 25, Units 5 and 10-12, Units 5 and 13, and Units 13 and 15 (Fig. 7), and best explained as the result of a servitudinal relationship. On the basis of observing shared structures between units, city block IX.3 can be divided into 11-12 properties consisting of one to ive units (Fig. 7). his division means that even the largest dwelling of city block IX.3, Unit 5, had direct control over only a limited part of it. here were small and medium-sized independent properties in addition to four larger entities -representing all four types of units in the classiication presented above. City block IX.3 is not unique in its composition, as this pattern is repeated throughout Pompeii (Anon, 2010). he integration of social groups inside city blocks repeats the tendency already observed in the city-wide analysis. he changes in the perimeter walls of the units in city block IX.3 show the evolution of properties in time, but, interestingly, this did not involve changes in the extent of properties by default. Instead, modiications in the way the shops and workshops in the frontage were connected with the rest of the house took place, for instance. In the case of the largest dwellings, Units 5 and 15, the shops were originally connected with the main house and only later on made physically separate entities. hrough this, the separation of the elite house and the commercial activity was made clearer, although the ownership of the property continued unchanged. Although changes in partition walls were not relected in facades, house frontages revealed much about the units behind them. hanks to the inherently diferent appearance of doorways -entrance doorways to private dwellings are narrow and doorways to commercial units are wide -the diferent functions of units behind diferent doorways were always clear to passers-by. he connection between units owned by the same proprietor was made visual through a variety of means. Although, apart from the electoral notices documented by early excavators, we know very little of the facade treatments of city block IX.3, a few visual clues remain. he junction of the facades of Units 24 and 25 is accentuated by moulded stucco, for instance, and the pavement in front of Unit 15 is in crushed white marble mixed with mortar instead of the widely used cocciopesto. he electoral notices are located on the facades of the commercial properties in the corners of Units 1-2, 10-12, and 19-20. Unit 5 was the only dwelling with notices painted in connection with its entrance. All of the large properties attracted more than one notice, apart from the one consisting of Units 14, 15, and 16 despite its location on a busy street and connection to a large residence. he preference of commercial properties in city block IX.3 difers from the results of the analysis of the distribution of electoral notices in the sample regions. Corners were open to two directions, which can partly explain why the corner properties were preferred. he size of the property could also be a factor in choosing a location for painting notices. But the presence of notices relects the political -and social -connectedness of the owners. Most of the shared utilities were hidden in the supporting structures of houses, such as downpipes inside walls or cess pools under loors, but a window between two units afords a direct connection between them. A window can even allow direct observation of what happens in the adjacent units. What is interesting in the windows between units in city block IX.3 is that in most cases they were located above eye level. here are no more than three windows at eye level or below height of 2 m on both sides of the partition wall. hese are found between Units 3 and 5 and between Units 17 and 19-20, which, as already suggested, were probably owned in common. he rest of the shared windows probably resulted from light servitude, which, prior to the advent of artiicial lighting, may have been crucial for the lighting of rooms that had no windows (Anon, n.d.) directed onto open spaces. Although privacy was not under the protection of any particular law in the classical era (Anon, n.d.), there were no particular rights that made it possible to see into a neighbouring house either (Anon, n.d.). his strengthens our interpretation of the common ownership of units that shared windows through which one could look over into an adjacent unit. While the windows between Units 17 and 19-20 are narrow and partly blocked, limiting the views, the window between Units 3 and 5 is no less than 1.6 m wide and at least 0.8 m high. his would have allowed neighbours not only to see in from one unit to another but to interact and keep an eye on activities taking place on the other side. Consequently, while windows between neighbouring units were supposedly made to improve lighting conditions, some of them in fact allowed control over others and take us from practical functions to social ones. Located between the kitchen of an elite house (Unit 5) and the back room of a shop (Unit 3), directly above a cooking podium, the window might well have functioned as a serving hatch between the units. We may go as far as to propose that the shop operated as a vending place for the products of the kitchen of the elite house next door. In this case, Unit 5 would have maximised the production capacity of its kitchen (staf) and the income generated by its holdings. In any case, the window constituted a potential problem for the adjacent shop, as the fumes emitted from the kitchen were dispersed to the shop through the window. he comfort of those, either slaves or tenants, working in the shop was of no concern, however, to the elite owners eager for increased proit. Notwithstanding the precise function of the shop, Unit 3 is an example of a workshop-shop that operated under the direct control of the adjacent elite house. While windows between workshops and the private houses behind them are also known elsewhere in Pompeii (e.g. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), our case presents the irst example of units that can be functionally linked together on the basis of window locations. Units 5 and 3 serve as good examples of the social and economic control of the elite over its neigh-bours. As discussed in the irst part of this paper, bars are commonly found next to the entrances to prestigious houses. What our example suggests is that they were owned in common too. he combination of large elite houses surrounded by smaller shops owned in common served the purpose of bringing visibility and economic success to the upper class, as well as allowing them control over the town's economic activities, street life, and social relations (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2005). However, the elite was not free from social control. City block IX.3 contained three other large properties that consisted of several units and must have rivalled with each other. he visibility of the elite and their property portfolios were easy targets for public criticism. his paper has examined how the social, economic, and political relations between diferent social groups in Pompeii were displayed in the cityscape. Instead of clear dominance and seclusion of the elite, integration of various groups and their activities can be seen. Many activities took place in the streets, particularly on street corners, and the loci for actions were organised locally, probably in co-operation between the various social groups inhabiting the adjacent city blocks. he elite houses were invariably located in the busiest streets, and they probably inluenced the commercial activities taking place in the shops lanking these thoroughfares. Social rituals comparable to the salutatio known from literary sources, as well as bar life, took place in properties belonging to the elite and strengthened their social power. he election notices supporting diferent candidates displayed on the facades of elite houses were intended to have an impact on the political life of the city, but they also indicate places where people stopped to read the messages on the walls and to scribble their own texts. Political life was mostly controlled by the elite, which is clear from the distribution of the notices concentrating on the largest dwellings. On the basis of mapping shared structures among neighbouring houses, we can begin to understand how city blocks were divided into separate properties, the number of which is smaller than the number SOUNDS LIKE THEORY of architectonically discrete units. hese properties constituted the landscape of social, economic, and political power, but the elite houses have less direct control over the area of the city block than could be expected. Small, medium-sized, and large commercial properties cover most of the ground area in city blocks and display the integration of social groups on the micro level. he landscape of ownership and social relations was not immune to changes. In addition to properties that shared a number of structures in AD 79, there may have been further units previously owned in common, some units of which were later sold of and became independent units. Additional units were physically separated from the houses they had belonged to, but remained in the hands of the same proprietor. hese units owned in common could, at least in principle, have operated rather independently. In contrast, as the example of Units 3 and 5 has shown, other units operated under the direct control of their neighbours on a daily basis. However, regardless of the level of everyday interaction between units owned in common, their connections were made visual in one way or another. hese visual clues marked the realm of direct social control and divided the neighbourhood into diferent power networks. Social, economic, and political power was concentrated in the hands of the elite in Roman society. In Pompeii, elite housing was dispersed in the city and inside the city blocks, enabling the elite to control the streetscape as well as their adjacent properties. At the same time, the non-elite could observe the activities in the elite dwellings and the balance of social control could be maintained. hus the dominance of the elite based on the resources concentrated to them formed the foundations of social networks in Pompeii. he hierarchical nature of the society generated peer pressure and inherent control of conduct in respect of the expected behaviour it for one's standing. Architecture and wall inscriptions guided the inhabitants of Pompeii in inding the loci where to negotiate their diferent networks.",

    "title": "Pompeii and its Hinterland Connection: The Fuel Consumption of the House of the Vestals (<i>c</i>. Third Century BC to AD 79)",
    "abstract": "Bio-archaeological studies can contribute significantly to understanding the economic interactions between cities and their hinterland. In Pompeii, where research has often been intramurally focussed, analysis of biological remains is often confined to bones and macro-botanicals consumed as foodstuffs. Charcoal, if collected, often remains unexamined, and yet this material is key to understanding the fuel economy of a city. This study has two goals: first, to describe an efficient method for charcoal sampling and analysis in a dense urban environment using only dry-sieved charcoals above 5 mm; and, second, in doing so, to demonstrate the dependent relationship between Pompeii and its hinterland for the provision of fuel in a case study from the House of the Vestals. A pilot study of 25 contexts from six 'rooms' and 750 charcoal fragments was followed by an extended study of 62 contexts over 14 rooms (a total of 1579 charcoal fragments). The extended results identified only two further (minor) taxa (represented by only three fragments). The most important wood identified was beech ( Fagus sylvatica), which constituted 50-75 per cent of the fuel supply, depending on the time period. Beech grows preferentially above about 900 m in central and southern Italy. Pompeii lies at 30 m altitude with the nearest mountain areas at least 15 km away. The study suggests that a methodology that relies on collection of charcoal from routine dry sieving (5 mm grid), in soils where this is possible, can provide robust results in a cost effective manner in an urban setting.",
    "full_text": "The city of Pompeii, which lies 50 km south of the Italian city of Naples, was buried by ash during the Vesuvian eruption of AD 79. In the last twenty years, comprehensive multidisciplinary excavations have commenced below the AD 79 horizon. Some of these have included publication of bioarchaeological remains (Fulford & Wallace-Hadrill, 1995)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2001)(Anon, 2012). Of the limited archaeological studies of charcoal in Pompeii, (Castelletti, 1976) examined a small charcoal assemblage from one context in the archaic period. (Jashemski, 2002) found small quantities of charcoal in garden soils (but these were not identified). More recently, as part of a tomb study near Porta Nocera (Andringa et al., 2004), macro plant remains associated with burial, cremation, and subsequent ritual have been reported (Anon, n.d.), as well as the charcoals (Coubray, 2003). The Anglo-American Project in Pompeii (AAPP) (Universities of Bradford and Stanford, and later, the University of Oxford), completed excavation of an entire insula of the city (Regione VI insula 1) from 1995 to 2006. The excavation of the House of the Vestals was finalized in 2000. In the House, as in the rest of the insula, near complete recovery of all artefacts and ecofacts was carried out by a team of around 100 staff, students and specialists in twelve 5-week seasons. Excavation on this scale has produced a large amount of material, including charcoal remains. Pompeii is located near the Tyrrhenian Sea on the mouth of the river Sarno, in the fertile Campanian plain (Figure 1). Trace remains of the early Iron Age Italic peoples have been found and evidence for both Greek and Etruscan influence exists for the period from the eighth to the sixth centuries BC, culminating in the construction of the city walls. In the fourth century, an Italic people identified as the 'Samnites' who originated from the Apennines, descended from the mountains, gradually dominating the cities of the plain, including Pompeii (Anon, n.d.). Rome began her ascendancy over the next couple of centuries and gradually took over the Italian peninsula. The city of Pompeii was besieged by the Roman general Sulla in the first century BC, and became a Roman colony in 80 BC. The coast was considerably further inland than today (Anon, n.d.), and probably less than 1 km from the city of Pompeii (Pescatore et al., 2001). The Campanian plain is low-lying, with some parts below sea level, and thus areas around the Sarno were prone to flooding. Pompeii is set on the only landform of any height (at 30 m altitude), on a small, ancient lava plateau (Anon, n.d.). Ecologically, the Mediterranean climate consists of hot dry summers and mild winters, although microclimate variation is considerable (Anon, n.d.). From pollen studies in areas a little distant, including Lake Avernus (Anon, n.d.), the Bay of Naples (Allevato et al., 2010), the Bay of Salerno (Anon, n.d.)(Donato et al., 2008), and a small local study (Anon, n.d.), the historic arboreal and agricultural conditions may be reconstructed. Cold climate trees that typically exist at lower altitudes in northern Europe were restricted to the mountainous areas delineating the Campanian plain, i.e. Mt. Vesuvius (volcanic soil), the central Apennine range and the Lattari Mountains (both calcareous). Examples of such taxa include Abies alba (alpine fir, or silver fir), above 1000 m, and Fagus sylvatica (beech), from about 800 to 1000 m (Anon, n.d.). These three taxa are now reasonably rare in the mountain areas surrounding the plain due to anthropogenic pressures (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). European Larix sp. (larch) does not occur naturally in Southern Italy, and Picea sp. (spruce), while being present in much earlier time periods (c. 14,000 BC), had disappeared by the classical period. The mid-montane altitudes, 400-800 m, were thought to have been dominated by mixed deciduous forests of Quercus spp. (oak), Castanea sativa (chestnut), Fraxinus sp. (ash), Ulmus spp. (elms), Acer spp. (maples), and members of the closely related Corylaceae Family: Carpinus spp. (hornbeams), Ostrya carpinifolia (hop hornbeam) and Corylus avellana (hazel). Evergreen oak was also present. Riverine species such as types of Alnus spp. (alder), and members of the Saliceae family-Salix spp. (willow) and Populus spp. (poplar)-in ancient times would have commonly spread along the river flats, wherever agriculture did not occupy the fertile soil of Campania Felix. On the lower montane areas, and woodland margins, more degraded forms of forest may also have occurred, i.e. macchia (Anon, n.d.). Taxa from this environment include Erica arborea (tree heather), Arbutus unedo (strawberry tree), Pistacia spp. (pistachio), and, close by on the coast, various types of Pinus spp. (pine) and Cupressus sempervirens (cypress). Some macchia species such as Pistacia spp. and Arbutus spp. were also grown for commercial and medicinal use (as attested in the ancient sources, in particular, Pliny the Elder's Natural History), and were likely cultivated to some extent in city gardens and orchards. Regional archaeological records indicate the presence of 'rural' Roman villa farm settlements (at AD 79) on average as frequently as every 400 m and occasionally only 90 m apart. Maps produced by the Superintendency of Pompeii documenting this density of settlement can be viewed at the Antiquario di Boscoreale (the Boscoreale Museum near Pompeii), but have unfortunately not been formally published. The ancient Roman agronomist writers also attest to intensive cultivation of the fertile plain, for example Strabo (Geography V.4.3) tells us Campanian soils supported four crop rotations per year. Wood for fuel could have been obtained from local gardens and orchards, potentially from the Sarno Plain and from the mountains nearby. Little formal evidence for the fuel supply, either historic or archaeological, is yet attested. Figure 2 shows a plan of the location of the House of the Vestals within the city. The House's development is discussed in a number of publications (Jones & Robinson, 2004)(Anon, n.d.)(Jones & Robinson, 2005)(Jones & Robinson, 2003). The first signs of habitation occur in the late fourth century BC. Between the fourth and second centuries BC, a small house of a few rooms developed on the via Consolare side of the insula. A (primary) foundation deposit (c. 200 BC) was sealed around the time of the commencement of the later house in an area under the southeast edge of the atrium. (This charcoal is to be reported separately.) In the second century BC, the House of the Vestals was extended across the insula, and in the first century, after the Sullan siege and subsequent Roman political takeover in 80 BC, all buildings were combined to form one luxury dwelling with two peristyles and even a small swimming pool in the Augustan period. Following the eruption of Vesuvius and burial in pumice and ash, the area was left dormant. Bourbon excavations in the eighteenth century caused disturbance to some parts of VI.1, and trampling by tourists and excavators alike has also occurred. While cooking activities are the primary means by which charcoal would have been introduced into the Roman archaeological record in a domestic environment, also to be considered are heating of rooms and/or water for bathing suite; possibly building activities (Anderson, 1999); ritual or industrial activities (often associated with domestic structures); reuse of burnt charcoal for sanitation or garden fertilization (which might have been site sourced, or externally sourced); and major fire events (although there is no evidence for this in the House of the Vestals). The charcoal data that were obtainable were mostly from undifferentiated secondary fills, especially from the kitchen areas, but none of these were true primary deposits. Individual deposits represent the average wood use of a limited area over the given time period each context represents (according to standard ceramic typologies and coins in this period). Secondary deposits provide the greatest likelihood of evidencing 'average' fuel use. It is a difficulty in some charcoal studies that primary contexts are privileged (which attest to the last, or last few, burn events), and that they conflate results for primary and secondary contexts, and/or employ several different recovery and sampling methods in one study. In a dense urban environment such as Pompeii, archaeological priorities of defining standing remains, usually by 'room', and analysing ceramics and coins and other artefacts, dominate collection strategies for environmental remains. The associated archaeological practices differ somewhat from prehistoric site excavations, where flotation of standard soil samples forms the kernel of recovery of bio-archaeological remains (either on a randomized, systematic basis, or by way of selection of contexts of interestor, potentially, both). The AAPP recovery strategy aimed at near total recovery of all remains, in that all excavated soils were dry-sieved to recover artefacts and ecofacts above the sieve size (5-mm grid). Additionally, from all excavated contexts, an un-sieved sample of soil was processed by flotation (a 20-l sub-sample, i.e. two 'buckets,' or less, if the context was smaller). This meant that specialists had at their disposal the dry-sieved (above 5 mm) remains, and the floated (above 500 microns) remains for every single context (some 5000 contexts in total for the House of the Vestals). Far more material was recovered than could be analysed. For the purposes of this study, a small informal investigation was carried out comparing the results of the two recovery methods. Initial comparisons of taxon diversity from flotation and taxon diversity from excavation/dry sieving, for charcoal from the same contexts, showed a loss of diversity from flotation. Taxa recovered from flotation were invariably the major hardwoods (which better survive the mechanical stresses involved). This result is at odds with the most commonly accepted beliefs about recovery approaches for charcoal. In general, flotation is accepted, mostly unquestioningly, as being a superior collection method (Anon, n.d.). Conditions for charcoal collection will depend substantially on the soil matrix. Dry sieving, while being the quickest and least costly method, is not suitable for wet soils or those containing much clay (like many UK depositional environments, for instance). Examination of the dry-sieved charcoals only is reported here. The approach aimed to optimize cost/benefit, while ensuring the adequacy of the subsampling strategy adopted. In this study, a total of sixty-two different 'contexts' were examined in the extended study (cf. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) who recommend a minimum of twenty-five to fifty contexts). Excavated contexts in a dense urban environment can vary in volume greatly, compared with the usual consistency of floated soils in pre-and proto-historic sites that are typically a fixed quantity of 20-50 l. However, this difference is not a drawback, provided a range of context types and volumes are examined. Flotation of a fixed volume of soil is less representative than sieving all excavated soils, although it does enable the collection of much smaller fragments. New research, however, suggests that bias (by way of over-representation, of oak in particular), is greatly observed in the 1-2 mm fraction, and even to a degree in the 2-4 mm fraction (Chrzavzez et al., 2011). (Anon, 2005) (and others) recommend sampling, especially middens or other secondary refuse deposits, to obtain the most suitable data. In Pompeii, no true refuse dump was found at the House of the Vestals (or indeed in any of the other sites currently being examined within the city). Charcoal is a fragile ecofact, which fragments on initial excavation or flotation, and continues to fragment at each stage of handling. Potentially, the time to examine the assemblage continually increases as the number of fragments increase (and their average size decreases), so limiting identification to a suitable sub-sample of charcoal from contexts with a lot of charcoal is an important aspect of cost consideration. Ranges of optimum fragment counts from a low of about 100 to a high of about 400 fragments are recommended per context (or period) (see, for example, (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Most of the Pompeian contexts contained around 30-50 fragments. This meant that to obtain significant results, analysed contexts were grouped by century, and around 250 fragments per century were examined in both the preliminary and extended studies. Standard works on wood structure and relevant wood atlases were used in identification (Anon, 1990)(Anon, 2000)(Anon, 2000)(Anon, 2004). Nomenclature follows (Anon, 2003), and the International Plants Names Index (IPNI). It should be noted that identification of Mediterranean woods using northern European atlases (of the same taxa) is occasionally difficult due to climatic differences. Collection and charring of local modern reference material is therefore of importance. The modern reference collections of the University of Bradford and University College London were consulted and augmented mostly with woods from Pompeii's ancient and modern cities and mountain areas surrounding the Campanian plain. Measuring weights of charcoal, or counting fragment numbers, are the two main modes of quantification in charcoal analysis. For this study, fragment count was adopted as it is more convenient and time effective. Percentage frequency analysis (PFA) was carried out after eliminating counts for indeterminate fragments (those charcoals which could not be identified due to poor visibility of cellular structures) (Anon, n.d.). All indeterminate fragments were dicotyledons. PFA suffers from the limitation that if the percentage of one taxon alters, then so too do all others, and so data are not independently represented. Results can additionally suffer from taphonomic bias, which may or may not be consistent through the contexts. Here, contexts are grouped and analysed on a holistic basis by centuries, thus nonsystemic errors of bias in individual samples will tend to be averaged out. There was no evidence of significant faunal bioturbation, but post-depositional root penetration and inorganic salt crystal deposition were significant in some contexts. Both cause weakening of charcoal fragments, reducing the likelihood of identification. A preliminary study of 750 fragments was made of the House of the Vestals charcoal (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In this study, contexts that contained from three to about eighty (average thiry) fragments were examined (Anon, n.d.), and these were mostly associated with the identified kitchen/service areas of the house. Later, a further service area located in a different part of the house (AA130) was added, giving a total of six 'rooms' in the house. From each 'room' four or five contexts were chosen through time, based on spot dates and excavation records (and discussions with director, Damian Robinson) so as to provide in the final analysis the examination of twenty-five contexts in total from the second century BC to AD 79 (the pilot study did not include third century BC material). Figure 3 shows the rooms at AD 79 from which the initial samples were taken. For the extended study, the scope of the pilot study was widened to increase the spatial coverage (Figure 4). For this area, a total of 1579 fragments were analysed. A small quantity of data for the third century BC also became available for this study. Only two new taxa were identified, Fraxinus sp. (one fragment) and Rhamnus/ Phillyrea sp. (two fragments), following the significant extension of data. Overall, the major diachronic results were unchanged. Table 1 provides a summary of the results. Of the Fagaceae family, the fragments are either Quercus sp. or Fagus sylvatica, with no Castanea sativa, Mill. Chestnut was possibly used as wood for construction in ancient times, or as a food tree predominantly, and its calorific potential is low by comparison with the other Fagaceae, and so its lack of presence as a fuel wood is not necessarily surprising. Chestnut has been reported in greater quantities in the late Roman period from the northern slopes of Vesuvius (Allevato et al., 2012), mostly as building timber. Most Quercus fragments could be identified as being either deciduous or evergreen. Fragments identified to the Corylaceae subfamily will be one of the other identified taxa: Carpinus (either C. betula or C. orientalis: hornbeam or oriental hornbeam), Corylus avellana (hazel), or Ostrya carpinifolia (hop hornbeam). The Acer (maple) observed consists of three or more species: Acer campestre (field maple), Acer opalus/obtusatum (Italian maple) and the Acer pseudoplatanus type. The latter two types are mostly montane (Anon, n.d.). Within the large family of Rosaceae, identification rests at a number of levels of refinement: (a) the Maloideae subfamily; (b) occasionally more precise identifications allow identification of Prunus spp. (a restricted group of the Prunoideae subfamily); and (c) within the subfamily Rosoideae, identification is possible to Rosa spp. Prunus spp. include cherries, plums, almonds and peach, but many of these were only just being introduced into Roman cultivation in the period; most Prunus fragments are likely P. avium L. (wild and cultivated, cherry) in the earlier centuries, with P. dulcis, P. persica, and P. armenaica probably appearing more often in the late first century BC into the first century AD. The later appearance of a greater variety of cultivated Prunus spp. agrees with both the carpology and charcoal results from the Porta Nocera Tomb (Matterne & (Derreumaux & M, 2008)(Coubray, 2003), and broadly with the carpology results from the House of the Surgeon (Anon, 2010)(Anon, 2012). The Maloideae subfamily includes fruits such as pear or apple, but also other taxa such as hawthorn and whitebeam or the service tree (sorb). Those identified only to the family level of Rosaceae are fragments with poor preservation characteristics, which could not be confidently resolved to a lower level. Small quantities of a range of woods that may also be considered food and/or medicinal plants (according to the ancient texts, in particular Pliny the Elder's Natural History) were observed. These include Vitis vinifera, and of the Pinus spp. (pine) possibly P. pinea (the stone pine that produces edible nuts), but some fragments are also one or more of the montane types, possibly P. nigra or P. mugo. There were a few fragments identified only as Conifer, and some of the high alpine fir Abies alba. The category of Rhamnus/Phillyrea covers a range of wood types from small macchia plants with some medicinal uses to bigger trees of wood suitable for fuel, but there were few of these fragments. Some key features emerge from these results. Sufficient data for the site appear to have been analysed in terms of sampling theory, since no new taxa were found for the last 25 per cent of fragments examined. Results grouped by wood type are shown in Figure 5. One taxon dominates time, namely Fagus sylvatica (beech), and beech diminishes with time. It is in fact found in virtually all of the contexts and the falling quantity of beech is coeval with an increase in a group of secondary fuel woods comprising oaks, maples, and hornbeams. There is an increase in diversity through time, especially after the Sullan siege and subsequent colonization, which followed Pompeii's subjugation in 80 BC (during the Social Wars). This trend is mostly characterized by an increase in fruit and nut types. The data for the third century BC are limited to only fourteen successfully identified fragments and so cannot be considered representative for this century, and are omitted from the results graph. Table 2 summarizes diversity for the House of the Vestals. These taxon counts are minima only, because they include families, subfamilies, and genera that represent two or more possibilities. Diversity counts have excluded those figures for Quercus (indist.), Fagaceae and Corylaceae, because these higher order identifications reflect taxa already counted. Maloideae, Rosaceae, and Coniferales are conversely always counted because these groupings represent so many different possible taxa. limitation is assumed to be consistent across time in order to comment on the data, and this is not strictly a valid assumption. For example, in one period, the genus Acer may reflect two possible species types, while in another it may reflect three or more. Ignoring the third century BC results, since fragment count is low, diversity increases only mildly from the second century BC to the first century BC, and increases at a higher rate moving from the first century BC to the first century AD. The larger jump may be as a result of the Sullan colonization early in the first century BC, leading to proscription of local élite property, and settlement by Roman veterans with subsequent planting of a greater variety of especially Prunus types, more local grapevines, and hazelnuts. Equally, the extant Samnite population might have been responsible for this change, since acculturation meant adoption of cultural mores in both directions. The decrease in beech over time is interesting in that it may be interpreted in one of two ways. On the one hand, pressure on the beech supply caused a diminution of beech forest at more accessible levels, and perhaps the available beech at mid-montane levels was replaced by other deciduous types, such as the oaks, hornbeams, and maples (which increase in presence over time). As fuel, these wood types together do not differ significantly in heat value. In contrast, the beech supply may not necessarily have been under pressure. With the increasing integration of the Roman empire, the Roman habit of introducing and experimenting with foreign plants (in particular food trees) was combined with a desire to maximize use of all available resources (as recommended by ancient writers such as Cato). This may have led to the increased use of fruit and nut woods as kindling, simply because they were available and close by. In the case of the wealthy House of the Vestals such wood could potentially have been available in the garden of the property. A combination of both factors may have been in operation; however, pollen data for the period show no protracted deterioration in beech quantities (Anon, 2002)(Ermolli & Pasquale, 2002)(Grüger et al., 2002)(Donato et al., 2008)(Allevato et al., 2010), although pollen studies from in and around Pompeii exhibit serious difficulties with data representativeness, and, in general, trends in longer-scale pollen studies are difficult to correlate with shortterm charcoal studies. The most reliable pollen studies-from the Bay of Naples or Salento-are some distance away. There are difficulties of over-and underrepresentation in pollen, as there are in charcoal analysis. Scale and scope differences usually mean that a period of several hundred years in a charcoal study equate to only a thin line on a long-term pollen study. Nevertheless, the wood types identified in the charcoal do not significantly differ from the pollen studies of the region. The woods found represent a wide variety of habitats, from the plain to the upper mountain areas, demonstrating a clear interaction between the city and its hinterland. Nearly all are high heat value woods. Marginal and shrub taxa exist in only very small quantities, suggesting their inclusion is incidental. Beech, which grew at an altitude just below the alpine conifers (and sometimes mixed with them) was, and is, the highest growing hardwood in Italy (Anon, n.d.). Beech is a dense wood (0.73 g/cm 3 ) (Giachi et al., 2003), and has a high calorific value. Beech is generally a slow-growing tree but can sometimes be coppiced on a short rotation and has more commonly been pollarded at longer intervals (Anon, 2001) Some of the fuel wood was collected from fallen branches, as attested by the presence of pre-depositional hyphae. Beech requires high altitude for optimum growth in southern Italy. Photosynthesis is optimized between 1200 and 1500 m in the current climate (Anon, n.d.). Consequently, its dominance in the charcoal assemblage at the House of the Vestals provokes several questions about the source of the wood. The city is located on the Campanian plain at an altitude of only 30 m, some distance from any mountains. The climate of the Mediterranean region two thousand years ago is widely considered to have been similar in temperature to today, or perhaps even slightly warmer, although many conflicting data exist (Lamb, 1977)(Anon, 1995)(Anon, 1998)(Reale & Dirmeyer, 2000)(Reale & Shukla, 2000). Fluctuations even within the 400-year period under question have been noted (Anon, 2000)(Magny et al., 2002)(Büntgen et al., 2011)(Mccormick et al., 2012). However, these studies provide a wide view geographically, and acknowledge that microclimates may vary considerably from the 'average'. While in this instance it is especially difficult to separate out anthropogenic changes from small climactic variations, it is very unlikely that beech grew in profusion on the plain since it prefers altitude and good drainage, and the Sarno plain was very boggy. Pollen evidence suggests the wood was plentiful in the classical period (Anon, 2001), and, if this were the case, it can be inferred that growth conditions were good and beech-dominated forests may have been extensive at high altitudes. The first reported charcoal study in Pompeii, and the only one to fully identify the wood types adequately, was by (Anon, n.d.), who examined 200 fragments of charcoal. These were identified as beech, and further noted to be of large dimensions, and possibly 'collected nearby'. Castelletti interpreted this as being wood prepared as charcoal fuel. Subsequent interpretations of this report have extended his observations well past the reported results and led to the promulgation of the idea of a 'sacred beech grove' growing in the sixth-century city (e.g. (Anon, 1984). This is an implausible interpretation given the ecological requirements of beech, whose optimal growth zone is above 900 m, compared to Pompeii's location at near sea level, and also because the cutting of larger branches or small trunks for making charcoal would seem at odds with a religious use. Beech may well have been present on Vesuvius at higher altitudes, although it is more likely that the most fertile and accessible areas were occupied with vines, olives, and orchards, since these were likely higher monetary-value crops than wood. This is yet to be proven, however, and we cannot assume standard modern market forces existed in the ancient world. Beech prefers weakly acidic soils, so the calcareous Lattari Mountains (to the south) and the Apennines (to the east), could have supplied fuel to the city. These areas are respectively 15 and 25 km distant, the latter representing about a day's journey. Wood and/or wood charcoal fuel could have been transported by oxen and cart or mule train, down the mountain to the main road, or to the Sarno River. From there it could have been transported to the city, either along the riverside road, or perhaps on the river itself on a seasonal basis. The secondary fuel woods (oaks, maples, hornbeams) may have been similarly harvested from slightly lower areas in the mid-montane reaches, but these woods would also have been available to some extent on the plain and in the city. The nature and volume of the fruit and nut woods suggest these were likely cuttings used as kindling, and they may have been locally available from gardens and orchards inside the city walls, or from more distant areas of the lower mountain areas where orchards grew. Being a wealthy household, the House of the Vestals may have owned land in the mountains, sending their own slaves to collect wood and/or make charcoal, and transport the fuel to the city. It is also possible that a more developed wood and charcoal market existed, as it did in Rome (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). This study of urban fuel use in a wealthy household in Pompeii suggests a strong link between the city and its hinterland mountains, providing a more outward-looking view of one part of Pompeii's economy. It demonstrates that sampling of available charcoals, of 5 mm or more in length, from dry-sieved soils can be a cost-effective manner to view the wood fuel supply in a dense urban environment. It is acknowledged that dry sieving cannot be carried out at all sites. Excavators finding only a few fragments of charcoal per context often believe that they do not have much charcoal and thus do not collect it. However, even this small amount of data, synthesized over many contexts provides useful results. Charcoal may be collected like any other artefact, and not necessarily reserved for specialist collection by flotation. Combining data from individual contexts, into centuries for reporting purposes overcomes the difficulties of small data quantities from individual contexts. This is a valid strategy: firstly, because it is based on truly systematic and holistic data collection, and secondly because changes in the environment from which fuel is derived are unlikely to be able to be detected in much shorter periods. In the case of the House of the Vestals, a distinctive pattern of fuel consumption has been observed that correlates with the increasing complexity of social and economic activity that developed in Pompeii, especially after the Roman colonization in 80 BC. A vertical supply arrangement (by villa owners from their own forest supply areas) could have existed, and/or a more general market supply. In either case, wood and wood charcoal fuel were transported over considerable distances. Inferred labour and transport costs suggest the fuel economy was an important part of the overall economy of the city.

Les études bioarchéologiques peuvent contribuer considérablement à la compréhension des interactions économiques entre les villes et leur arrière-pays. À Pompéi, où la recherche s'est surtout concentrée sur le site intra-muros, l'analyse des restes biologiques est souvent limitée aux denrées alimentaires consommées comme les os et les résidus macrobotaniques. Dans la plupart des cas le charbon, s'il est ramassé, n'est pas examiné, bien que cette matière est la clé pour comprendre comment une ville organise son approvisionnement en et sa consommation de combustible. Cette étude poursuit deux buts: d'abord, décrire une méthode efficace d'échantillonnage et d'analyse de charbon dans un environnement urbain dense en n'utilisant que du charbon de taille supérieure à 5 mm obtenu par tamisage par voie sèche, et ensuite, montrer de cette façon les relations de dépendance entre Pompéi et son arrière-pays pour l'approvisionnement en combustible dans une étude de cas de la Maison des Vestales. Une étude-pilote de 25 contextes provenant de 6 'chambres' et de 750 morceaux de charbon fût suivi d'une étude approfondie de 62 contextes de 14 'chambres' (un total de 1579 morceaux de charbon). Les résultats étendus n'identifiaient que 2 autres taxons (insignifiants) (représentés par seulement trois morceaux). Le plus important parmi le bois identifié était le hêtre (Fagus sylvatica), qui représentait entre 50 à 75% de l'alimentation en combustible, selon la période considérée. Les hêtres poussent de préférence au-dessus de 900 m dans le centre et le sud de l'Italie. Pompéi est situé à 30 m d'altitude; les régions montagneuses les plus proches se trouvent à une distance d'au moins 15 km. L'étude suggère qu'une méthodologie qui se fonde sur la collection de charbon provenant de tamisage sec effectué couramment (tamis de 5 mm), dans des sols où ceci est possible, peut apporter des résultats fiables à peu de frais, dans un milieu urbain.

An Integrated Archaeological and Textual Approach 115 Alan Kaiser Porticus and cryptoporticus were among the most characteristic architectural elements of Roman luxury villa architecture. he frequent use of these structures in villa architecture as well as their prominent depiction in representations of villae point to their importance in luxury villa life. As contemporary authors inform us, the appropriation of porticus and cryptoporticus in villa architecture emulated the grandeur of public architecture, which was in turn informed by the Hellenistic East (Stat. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). heir use in the repertoire of luxury villa architecture has been argued to be indicative of the reception of Hellenistic culture in the Roman private sphere (Anon, n.d.)(Rakob, 1974)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). By incorporating these monumental public structures into domestic architecture, Roman designers wished to assimilate both the luxuria of the Hellenistic East and the grandiose character of Roman public architecture (Tombrägel, 2010). he proliferation of these structures in villas exempliies the reception of Hellenistic public architecture in the Roman private sphere, just as the incorporation of the peristyle at the end of the second century BC (e.g. Casa del Fauno, VI 12, 2.5) and the subsequent shift of the main living-areas of the houses from the atrium to the peristyle does in the town houses of Pompeii (Dickmann, 1997). In this paper, I examine the meaning and function of porticus and cryptoporticus in the luxury villa architecture of irst century BC to irst century AD Campania. I focus on the term cryptoporticus, which was only used by Pliny the Younger (Ep. 2.17, (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) in the irst century AD and propose that the architectural structure it described was invented in this period in order to satisfy the evolving needs of luxury villa owners. Speciically, the cryptoporticus, which Pliny the Younger deined as a covered and enclosed walkway (above-ground as well as semi-subterranean; (Anon, n.d.), provided an alternative to open-air walkways, such as porticus (Anon, n.d.) or xystus (an open-air walk aligned with trees: (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), in which the light, air and ventilation could be regulated. In doing so, I tackle the ways in which the design of both porticus and cryptoporticus accommodated the life led in luxury villas on the basis of contemporary literary sources. Four luxury villas around the Bay of Naples (c. 100 BC-AD 79) are the focus of this paper: Villa A (Fig. 3.1) at Oplontis (Franciscis, 1975)(Anon, n.d.)(Guzzo, 2000)(Guzzo & Fergola, 1963)(Anon, n.d.)(L & Clarke, 2007)(Anon, n.d.), the owner of which has been argued to have been the consort of (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), Villa San Marco (Fig. 3.2) and Villa Arianna A (Fig. 3.3) at (Anon, n.d.). (Anon, n.d.). (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2001) and Villa of the Papyri (Fig. 3.4) in ) and Villa of the Papyri (Fig. 3.4) in the outskirts of Herculaneum (Anon, 1986)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 2005)(Guidobaldi & Esposito, 2009)(Anon, n.d.). hese four villas provide a relatively small, yet representative sample of the luxury villa phenomenon around the Bay of Naples (Anon, 1970)(Anon, n.d.)(Kockel, 1985)(Anon, 1996)(Adams, 2006)(Moormann, 2007). Recent studies have addressed the modern misapplication of ancient terminology (Leach, 1997) and the ways in which the evidence is sometimes compromised by the use of literary texts when interpreting material remains (Allison, 1992)(Allison, 2001). hey have pointed out that we need to judge these concerns on a case-by-case basis (Riggsby, 1997)) and that the study of material remains is more insightful in understanding the ways in which spaces were used in the Roman house (Allison, 1997)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Although the material remains enable us to address the multivalent character of walkways (such as porticus and cryptoporticus), such as their use as temporary storage spaces of sculptures (e.g,. in porticus 34 in Villa A at Oplontis, Fig. 3.1), they do not provide suicient information for analyzing the meaning and function of these architectural structures as passages within the house. Consequently, in order to deine the walkways in Roman luxury villas I examine references to these structures by contemporary villa owners of the period examined here (irst century BC-irst century AD), mainly Cicero and Pliny the Younger. Although their letters present a highly self-conscious self-representation that implicitly theorizes Roman (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) culture and stage villa life in order to it their sociopolitical ambitions (Ludolph, 1997)(Anon, 1999)(Anon, 2002)(Anon, n.d.)(Morello, 2007)(Anon, 2008), they describe the ways in which the architecture accommodated the owners' daily activities (Anon, n.d.)(Riggsby, 2003). he meaning of a term is very lexible and can change through time and difer from author to author. For example, Vitruvius (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), writing some time after 27 BC, used the term porticus interchangeably with the term peristylium when describing colonnaded structures in the Roman housing. Conversely, Pliny the Younger, writing at the end of the irst century AD, made a clear distinction between the two terms and used porticus when speaking about houses and villas (Ep. 5.6, 14-15) and peristylium when referring to public architecture (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). he fact is that a variety of terms were used for the same structures and Roman authors often used Greek terms to \"season\" their writings in the Greek style. Cicero (Att. 1.5.7; 1.6.2; 1.7; 1.8.2) for example, writing around the middle of the irst century BC, used gymnasium to name colonnaded structures and was in fact the only author that used this term in descriptions of Roman villas and both Cicero (Att. 1.8.2; Brut. 3.10;) and Pliny the Younger (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) used the term xystus to describe an open-air walk planted with trees (for Cicero's villas see (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) for Pliny the Younger's villas see (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) dialogues in fact suggest that the Greek names given to colonnaded structures such as xystus and gymnasium were meant to recall areas connected with the traditions of philosophy in Athenian life and to assume the symbolic role of a bridge between the private and public sphere (Anon, n.d.). he meaning of the term porticus has subtle variations in passages that describe villa architecture. Vitruvius (De arch. 6.7.3) used the term porticus to signify the row of columns, for example, of the peristylium or peristylum: \"Next to this is a larger block of buildings with more splendid peristyles; in which the four colonnades have columns (porticus) of equal height, or else the colonnade which faces the south has higher columns (porticus).\" Pliny the Younger (Ep. 5.6, 14-15), however, used the term porticus to signify both the row of columns and the colonnaded space they deined, for example, the row of columns screening a façade (Anon, n.d.): \"My villa is on the lower slopes of a hill but commands as good a view as if it were higher up… It faces mainly south, and so from midday onwards in summer, a little earlier in the winter, it seems to invite the sun in the wide and protruding colonnade (porticus).\" he term cryptoporticus is irst attested in Pliny the (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) letters and no other author used this term until Sidonius Apollinaris (Epist. 2.2, 10) in the ifth century AD (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In his letters, (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) used the term cryptoporticus to describe an above-ground or semi-underground covered and enclosed passageway with side walls and windows on one or both sides (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). he use of the term cryptoporticus to describe an underground and/or vaulted passage is a result of a modern confusion between the term crypta and cryptoporticus (Anon, n.d.). he publication of the seminal conference in the école française de Rome entitled Les cryptoportiques dans l'architecture romaine in 1972, relected and perpetuated this confusion, and has inluenced the ways in which the term has been used in subsequent scholarship on Roman architecture (Anon, 1972). For example, (Anon, n.d.) traced the origin of the term from the word crypta, crupta, which most likely originated from the Greek terms κρυπτή, and κρυπτòς περίπατος, irst attested in Callixenus of Rhodes and cited by Athenaeus (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). (Anon, n.d.) addressed the Hellenistic precedents and (Anon, n.d.) identiied the purpose and use of these structures in Roman architecture. hus, hus, cryptoporticus was used in the conference to signify above-ground porticus with barrel vaults (e.g., in the sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at Praeneste; (Anon, n.d.) as well as underground barrelvaulted passages of villas (e.g., in the underground complexes of Hadrian's villa; Salza Prina Ricotti It was only in 2002 that (Anon, n.d.) pointed out that this use of the term was problematic and made clear that Pliny's cryptoporticus was not a subsequent development of the basis villae, or terrace substructures. he confusion of the meaning of the term cryptoporticus, however, is still dominant in the ield of ancient studies and although the architectural structure of the above-ground cryptoporticus has been identiied (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) it has not been critically examined. Pliny the Younger's description of the aboveground cryptoporticus in his Laurentine villa indicates that it was a covered and enclosed ambulatory, which had side walls with windows on one or both sides. Pliny also states that what the above-ground cryptoporticus ofered that the porticus or the xystus did not, was a walkway in which, the air, light and temperature could be regulated. Here begins a cryptoporticus, almost like a public one. It has windows on both sides, but more facing the sea, as there is one in each alternate bay on the garden side. As the sun beats down, the cryptoporticus increases its heat by the relection of the sun; it not only retains the sun but also drives back the north wind; and as much as it is hot in the front side, that much it is cold on the back side. In the same way it stops the southwest wind, thus breaking and restraining the various winds on each side. his is its advantage [sc., of the cryptoporticus] in winter, but more so in the summer, for before noon its shadow moderates the terrace (xystus), and after noon it [sc., its shadow] moderates the nearest part to it, which, as the day increases and decreases, gets low, sometimes shorter, sometimes longer, on one side or the other. he cryptoporticus itself does not receive the sun to a great extent because at its highest point the sun stops at the top [sc., of the cryptoporticus] (Plin. Ep. 2.17, 16-19). Since only Pliny the Younger used the term cryptoporticus in the irst century AD it was probably not a frequent term. It is probable that Pliny the Younger invented the term cryptoporticus to describe what was until then known with the generic term crypta; for example the covered hallway that runs around the north, east and south sides of the building of Eumachia in Pompeii and features windows looking into the internal courtyard was described as a crypta in the dedicatory inscription of the building (CIL X, 810, c. 2 BC (Anon, n.d.)(Moeller, 1972)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Both terms are used here in the sense that Pliny the Younger used them, that is, porticus as a walkway delimited by columns (e.g., rooms 20, 5, and 3 in Villa San Marco; Figs. 3.2, 3.5) and cryptoporticus as an above-ground covered and enclosed passageway with side walls and windows on one or both sides (e.g., rooms 13 and 24 in Villa A at Oplontis, Figs. 3.1, 3.6). In order to examine the ways in which porticus and cryptoporticus accommodated daily life in villas and tackle their meaning and function in villa architecture, the activities that Cicero and Pliny the Younger describe as taking place in them must be examined. Although not all villa owners would have engaged in the tightly scheduled intellectual occupations that Cicero and Pliny the Younger ofer, they give us an understanding of the daily rhythm in villas (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). An examination of Pliny the Younger's letters shows that villa owners passed some hours of their day working (whether work was an intellectual activity or not), walking, or sitting and relaxing in open-air promenades (usually called xystus, cf. Vitr. De Arch. 5.11.4; 6.7.5), which were shaded by the adjacent, or nearby, porticus or cryptoporticus: I wake when I like, usually after sunrise, often earlier but rarely later. My shutters stay closed, for in the stillness and darkness I feel myself surprisingly detached from any distractions and left to myself in freedom; my eyes do not determine the direction of my thinking, but, being unable to see anything, they are guided to visualize my thoughts. If I have anything on hand I work it out in my head, choosing and correcting the wording, and the amount I achieve depends on the ease or diiculty with which my thoughts can be marshaled and kept in my head. hen I call my secretary, the shutters are opened, and I dictate what I have put into shape; he goes out, is recalled, and again dismissed. hree or four hours after I irst wake [but I don't keep to ixed times] I betake myself according to the weather either to the xystus or to the cryptoporticus, work out the rest of my subject and dictate it. (Plin. Ep. 9.36, 1-3). As in the description of the above-ground cryptoporticus of his Laurentine villa (Ep. 2.17, 16-19), here again Pliny deines the function of the cryptoporticus on the basis of its environmental qualities: the decisive factor for preferring cryptoporticus to xystus was the weather, otherwise both structures provided comparable workspaces for the owner. An examination of the cryptoporticus and porticus in Villa Arianna A and Villa A at Oplontis indicates the ways in which they accommodated work space for the owners. In Villa Arianna A (Fig. 3.3), In Villa Arianna A (Fig. 3.3), (Fig. 3.3), , cryptoporticus 71 was located in between garden area V and crypta-ramp 76 that led to the sea through a series of ramps cutting through the substructures of the villa's platform (Anon, n.d.). he windows on both sidewalls of cryptoporticus 71, a series of wide conical-shaped windows along the southwest wall and two wide funnel-shaped windows along the northeast one, provided for air circulation, a concern that Pliny the Younger (Ep. 2.17, 16-19) expressed in the description of his Laurentine villa. he southwest windows invited the warm setting sun inside the cryptoporticus, while the northeast windows allowed the fresh breeze coming through the crypta-ramp (76, 61) from the sea to reach the space. he southwest side of cryptoporticus 71 opened onto a porticus (73), which had a diferent orientation than cryptoporticus 71 and was aligned with another porticus (U) at the other side of the garden (V) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Here, the owner had a choice between cryptoporticus 71 and porticus 73 in which to conduct his/her work. Likewise, in Villa A at Oplontis (Fig. 3.1) the owner could choose from the numerous porticus and cryptoporticus to conduct his work: between cryptoporticus 13 and 24, and porticus 40 looking to the south, porticus 60 looking to the east, porticus 56 and 76 looking west and porticus 33 and 34 facing north. he choice of one porticus and/or cryptoporticus over another would have depended not only on the weather, but also on the mood and personal taste of the owner. For example, porticus 33 and 34, facing north and having a smaller width and extent, would have been preferred on the hottest days of the summer or when the owners sought some privacy from the noise of the household, concerns that Pliny the Younger (Ep. 2.17, 18; 5.6, 21) expressed in his villa letters. By providing more than one space with similar environmental qualities, but with diferent extents and contexts, designer(s) not only emulated the monumental character of public architecture but also provided a number of choices for the daily life in villas. Going for a walk was an intrinsic part of the daily life of otium in villas (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Owners with their friends would go for leisure walks in the cryptoporticus, porticus and xystus in order to exercise or to engage in philosophical discussions. For example, Pliny the Younger (Ep. 9.36, 1-3), continuing the description of his summer days in his villa in Tuscany cited previously, went for a walk after inishing the dictation of the piece on which he was working since he woke up: I go for a drive, and spend the time in the same way as when walking or lying down; my powers of concentration do not lag and are in fact refreshed by the change. After a short sleep and another walk I read a Greek or a Latin speech aloud with emphasis, not so much for the sake of my voice as my digestion, though of course both are strengthened by this. hen I have another walk, am oiled, take exercise, and have a bath. If I am dining alone with my wife or with a few friends, a book is read aloud during the meal and afterwards we listen to a comedy or some music; then I walk again with the members of my household, some of whom are well educated. hus the evening is prolonged with varied conversation, and even when the days are at their longest, comes to a satisfying end (Plin. Ep. 9.36, 3-4). As Pliny the Younger's description indicates, for the longer walks villa owners went with carriages outside their estates. For their shorter walks however, after a mid-day nap, after reading for digestion, after taking exercise and after dinner, owners may have used the numerous long walkways (porticus, cryptoporticus and xystus) inside the villas. A quick count of the total length of the walkways in Villa Arianna A and Villa of the Papyri is indicative. In Villa Arianna A the big peristyle garden H-W (Fig. 3.3) provided a colonnaded walkway at least 320m long around the rectangular garden and in Villa of the Papyri the big peristyliumgarden (57-61; Fig. 3.4) provided a 280m long colonnaded walkway around the rectangular garden. Walking would indeed give a functional justiication to the proliferation of these elements in luxury villa architecture (Fig. 3.7). hese colonnaded walkways would have provided shaded and pleasant areas for all the hours of the day (Anon, 1990)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In Villa (Anon, n.d.). In Villa A In Villa A at Oplontis (Fig. 3.1), porticus 60 and porticus 56, surrounding the east wing of the villa, provided walks for diferent times of the day: porticus 56 at the west side for the morning hours, when the rooms behind it provided shade from the rising sun, and porticus 60 at the east side for the evening hours, when the rooms behind it provided shade from the setting sun. Both walks were equally pleasing, the one along the big park-like garden, the other along the swimming pool (96) and garden (98). Room 69 provided access from one to the other and provided ventilation for both, a concern that is expressed by (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). he cryptoporticus 13 cryptoporticus 24porticus 40 sequence protected the villa's south-facing interior spaces during the summer and provided a chain of walkways with a view to the seascape (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In Villa San Marco at Stabiae, several porticus (20, 5a, 5b, 3) formed a U-shaped enclosure that conined a garden (9) with a pool (15) in the middle (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). hese provided a walkway protected from the west and thus suitable for the evening hours, while cryptoporticus open to the southeast (7, 51) provided walks suitable for the midday and those porticus open to the west (1, 2) were suitable for the morning hours. An examination of the construction dates of porticus and cryptoporticus in the aforementioned examples indicates that these structures appear after the middle of the irst century BC and become very popular at the beginning of the irst century AD. In Villa of the Papyri, the peristylium-garden (57-61) and the cryptoporticus (56) to its southwest were added towards the end of the irst century BC (Anon, n.d.). In Villa Arianna A, cryptoporticus 71 dates from the Augustan period and the big peristylium-garden from the Claudio-Neronian period (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In Villa A at Oplontis the porticus (33-34) and cryptoporticus (13, 24) around the atrium core were constructed during the Augustan period, while the porticus and cryptoporticus of the east wing (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) were built towards the middle of the irst century AD (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In Villa San Marco, porticus (1, 2), actually date from the Augustan period, but only became parts of the villa during the Claudio-Neronian period. In this period the owner of Villa San Marco took possession of the villa next-door, to which porticus (1, 2) originally belonged, and connected porticus 1 and 2 to porticus 3 through ramp 4 (Rougetet, 1999)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). It is during the same period that the owner . It is during the same period that the owner added the arch-shaped cryptoporticus (62, 63) with the nymphaeum (64, 65) facing and also porticus 51 at the southeast (Anon, n.d.). In this way the (Anon, n.d.). In this way the . In this way the owner probably tripled the length of walkways within his villa -if one judges from the size of the remains -and created a monumental villa façade. As owners enlarged their properties, designers used the porticus structures to augment the monumental character of the villas and to provide spaces that accommodated the owners' daily activities. In doing so, I propose, designers modiied the design of the porticus and created the cryptoporticus as an alternative in the daily life in villas: a walkway that had closed walls, instead of an open-air colonnaded walkway (xystus or porticus), the air, light and temperature of which could be regulated, and in which owners could work or walk protected from the elements. As it has been already addressed, Pliny the Younger's (Ep. 2.17, 16-19; cf. Ep. 9.7, 4) descriptions emphasize the importance of the environmental qualities of the cryptoporticus and indicate that a cryptoporticus would have been used instead of an open-air walkway because of the protection it ofered from the elements (Ep. 9.36, 3). It is possible that this period of rebuilding and appropriating properties gave designers the opportunity to develop an architectural solution to the owners' evolving needs and the term cryptoporticus was coined to describe it. We cannot ascertain whether the precedents of the crypoporticus structure were found in the Hellenistic architecture in Asia Minor (Anon, n.d.), however, as (Anon, n.d.) analysis has shown, the cryptoporticus structure did bear similarities to the covered passageway around the Nile ship of Ptolemy IV. It is probable that Roman designers were fascinated with the architecture of travel just as Le (Anon, n.d.) in the 20th century was interested in the steam-powered ocean liners, the lay-out of which he emulated in his designs (e.g., Villa Savoye). Pliny the Younger's letters indicate that another important function of porticus and cryptoporticus within the villa was circulation. As walkways, porticus and cryptoporticus connected sections of the villa and in doing so gave access to the rooms along their way. Indeed, they serve to structure the narrative as Pliny the (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) guided his readers to the various rooms and spaces of his villas. As designers stretched out the villas' spaces onto the landscape, it was the porticus and cryptoporticus they used in order to provide diferent ways of access to those spaces. In Villa A at Oplontis, a parallel porticus (40) and cryptoporticus (24) provided diferent ways to access the east wing from the central body of the villa and I will argue that they served diferent purposes. In this villa there were two ways to go from the central atrium (5) towards the big reception rooms (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). I focus here on the route to one of the rooms, room 78. he irst route ran through cryptoporticus 24 and porticus 40. he cryptoporticus (24), accessed from the southeast corner of the atrium (Fig. 3.6), led to a porticus (40; Fig. 3.8) that ran around the garden (59) and led through passages 81 and 42 to room 78. he second approach to this large reception room was through another cryptoporticus (46; Fig. 3.9), which could be reached from the northeast corner of the atrium via a corridor (4), room 27 and peristyle 32. he cryptoporticus (46) led directly to a corridor (76), which was connected to reception room 78. I propose that the irst route was intended for the leisurely walks of the owner and his friends, whereas the second one was for the more everyday operations of the villa. In the irst route, which ran around the garden (59), the only visual connection with the interior of the villa was through a corridor (37) leading to the peristyle (32). Although cubicula (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) open onto the cryptoporticus (24), their doors could have been shut and the porticus (40) did not give access to any room. hus, the owner and his friends could have enjoyed a leisurely promenade: irst enjoying the view to the sea at the south from the cryptoporticus (24) and then the view of garden (59) from the porticus (40). Taking this route, the owner could have led his guests to the large reception room (78) without much interaction with the interior of the villa. he paintings and mosaics adorning the Porticus (40), corridor (81), and room (79) on this route are of the same character (Anon, n.d.) and provide a stylistically uniied architectural setting for this promenade. The second route passed through what is generally interpreted as the service area of the house (Anon, n.d.). his argument was based on the presumption that the so-called zebra stripe decoration in peristyle 32, the rooms around it and the cryptoporticus (46) was used in service areas. However, the studies by Corrado (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) and (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) have shown that these zebra patterns were in fact richer and more decorative than their current state suggests and that the areas in which the patterns appeared have been incorrectly thought of as servile. he \"stripes\" were originally black waves, blended to achieve a gradation that would result in the appearance of simulated marble as the best-preserved examples indicate (Anon, n.d.). he design was indeed used to adorn service or secondary areas but it would not only feature in such areas. he design was used in areas of public buildings that were not well lit, inclined, angled or curved or that were much traicked, for example the corridor H in the Stabian Baths at Pompeii (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), the interior passageways of the amphitheater at Pompeii (Corrado (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) and the cryptoporticus in the palaestra of Insula Orientalis II at Herculaneum (Corrado (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In private dwellings the design appeared in entrance spaces, corridors and passages, for example the corridors in the apartment complex above the Suburban Baths in Pompeii (Goulet & C, 2001)(Anon, n.d.)) and in the fauces, vestibulum and passage E of the Casa di Julius Polybius (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). he zebra patterns were probably meant to create an eye-catching and repeating design that would encourage movement in the more public areas of a house rather than signifying the service areas of the house (Corrado (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). In fact, the only rooms that are known archaeologically to be service areas (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) in Villa A at Oplontis do not bear zebra patterns, but rather are decorated in white, third style wall paintings (Anon, n.d.). he zebra patterns featuring in the spaces of this second route provided a uniied style of decoration and in doing so guided the person walking towards the eastern part of the house from the atrium (5). Visitors would have been led through a room (27), peristyle (32) and into the cryptoporticus (46) where they might sit on the benches along it, waiting to be received by the owner of the villa, or a member of his staf (Fig. 3.9). heir view would have been directed through the zebra patterns of the cryptoporticus through the opening of the porticus (60) onto the pool and garden complex (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Above the zebra patterns the wall decoration consisted of white rectangular panels decorated with garlands and aediculae and the ceiling presents panels decorated in a style comparable to that of the Domus Aurea. his large cryptoporticus was 4 meters wide, 30 meters long and at least 4 meters high. It was an appropriate area for business guests as it allowed a relatively restricted access to the villa: following this route visitors did not interact with the activities within the porticus (40)cryptoporticus (24) route or the cubicula to which they provided access. It is clear that the designer(s) intended a clear-cut separation between the two ways of accessing the eastern wing of the villa. Although the zebra-striped cryptoporticus (46) ran parallel to the north wing of porticus (40), there was no direct connection between these spaces. his deliberate separation between a porticus and a cryptoporticus often occurs in luxury villa architecture, for example, in Villa San Marco (2, 7, 51; Fig. 3.2), Villa of the Papyri (54, 56; Fig. 3.4) and Villa del Pastore, where in all cases a long cryptoporticus was placed right next to an equally long porticus and/or a xystus with access only at the beginning and end of the walkways. Furthermore, Furthermore, in both (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) villas, a cryptoporticus and/or a porticus were positioned next to a xystus. Villa A at Oplontis elucidates the Villa A at Oplontis elucidates the concept behind this design composition. he entire east part of the villa, starting from the beginning of cryptoporticus (46), was built towards the middle of the irst century AD (homas and (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). It was during this period that the southern cryptoporticus (24) together with a new porticus (40) were decorated in the fourth Pompeian style and that peristyle (32), the rooms around it and the associated cryptoporticus (46) were decorated in zebra patterns, both of which present a uniied, and distinctive, architectural and decorative design. hese two routes to the east wing were part of the circulation plan of the design project initiated after AD 45. he designer(s) aimed at providing two types of access to the east wing of the villa, one more private and more public, and clearly distinguished one from the other in terms of decoration. he frequent and sometimes excessive appearance of porticus and cryptoporticus in luxury villa architecture follows a familiar topos in Roman art. From the irst century BC the representation of colonnades with regal proportions in the second Pompeian style wall paintings, for example in the oecus (15) of Villa A at Oplontis, were a means of accentuating the social status of the owner by associating his private milieu with that of monumental architecture -and especially with the ideas of architectural magnificentia that were brought into Italy from the recently conquered Greek East (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Hesberg & H, 1992)(Kuttner, 1990). From the Augustan period onwards, the visual representations of colonnades inside villas gave way to their actual construction around the villas. As the he period of Pompeian second style painting indicates the irst step in the internalization of Hellenistic architecture within the domestic space of the villa or the domus (Borbein, 1973)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.), the porticus that begin enveloping the villa façades during the Augustan period and their later reception as emblematic images in the panels of the late third and fourth Pompeian style may be seen as second and third steps (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). While the use of porticus in villa architecture points to the assimilation of the architectural repertoire of Hellenistic and Roman public buildings in the private sphere, the invention of the cryptoporticus structure exempliies the ways in which Roman designers further appropriated this repertoire and proposed new architectural forms in order to provide alternatives for the daily life of otium in villas. In doing so, designers employed both porticus and cryptoporticus in their designs as elements of the villas' circulation plan as well as means of socially distinct accesses to the villa's spaces.",

    "title": "Water: Social Responsibility and the Concept of Common Good in the Ancient City of Pompeii",
    "abstract": "Pompeii was connected to the great Serino aqueduct under the principate of Augustus. From that moment on, water became not only a precious resource for the inhabitants but also their true social indicator. It is no coincidence, in fact, that the concentration of sumptuous dwellings is in Regio VI, the district closest to the aqueduct reservoir (castellum aquae in Latin) and the one most equipped with piezometric towers, the first of the network, the ones that would never leave the decorative fountains of the peristyles dry. From this observation follows the original possibility of considering the water network a factor that contributed to designating the morphology of urban neighbourhoods and blocks.",
    "full_text": "When the Greeks took over the primitive village on the slopes of Vesuvius, Pompeii took on the urban connotations typical of their colonies. Where the lava flow had blocked, forming a sort of natural terrace, the Forum was implanted, a sort of anomalous acropolis leaning towards the Doric temple that stood out in the triangular widening, to offer a superb panorama of the gulf, an excellent view to guarantee the city's inviolable defence from the sea. In fact, the lava that had covered the ground extending south and south-east before stopping about half a kilometre near the mouth of the Sarno made the city protected on this side, delegating the defence of the northern section to the mighty fortifications that were continually adapted. In a short time, a circuit of more than 3.3 km of walls encircled the city of Pompeii, which developed within it in an almost axial position to the northsouth direction and around a slight incision that would later be transformed into the main road, namely the via Stabiana, running from Porta Vesuvio (42.30 m altitude) to Porta Stabia (8 m altitude). Large, cultivated areas were initially incorporated into the walls, intended to ensure building expansion, and at the same time provide minimum fodder for the animals, and thus sustenance for the inhabitants, in the event of a prolonged siege. If the morphology of the lava plateau is responsible for the subdivision into urban parts that the city would progressively acquire, it is the availability of water that is responsible for their division into Regiones. The division into districts, in fact, already present in the Samnite age, was preserved in the Roman age, as the toponymic permanence referring to the Salinienses, the Gampanienses, the Urbulanenses, and the Forenses, to be understood as inhabitants of the respective 'vici' of the city (districts), rather than as members of professional associations, seem to testify. However, the availability of water, somewhat congruent with the needs of the community, had repercussions on the character of the distribution of the social classes, due to a singular selective mechanism of prices recorded according to the distance of the areas from the water cisterns. Being devoid of springs, Pompeii's volcanic soil forced its residents to obtain water by collecting rainwater, drawn, in an inconvenient manner, from a few very deep wells (just 5 and over 30 m deep) or by drawing it from the Sarno river below. It is not surprising, therefore, that in Roman times it would be precisely the derivation from the new-born Serino aqueduct that would highlight and emphasise, within the city, the formal subdivision generated by social classes and through these the building character that characterised the different urban parts. When they were free to choose, the Romans always preferred to find their cities on flat areas. Among the preeminent reasons for this choice was the far easier distribution of water in flat urbanism compared to the complexity of the morphologically rugged one. In Pompeii, the great difference in altitude forced the adoption of sophisticated hydraulic solutions to ensure effective urban water destruction. Enclosed within the mighty Greek walls, most of the dwellings exhumed from ashes and lapilli are of undoubtedly Roman design and certainly built after the conquest of Lucius Cornelius Sulla (89 BC). With the settlement of the dictator's veterans in the city, their peculiar residential needs were introduced, first and foremost the construction of thermal baths, characterised by a huge consumption of running water, a further stimulus for the construction of a more adequate aqueduct (Anon, 2002). The more than 30 m of urban gradient recorded in Pompeii, equal to a water pressure in the pipelines and lead pipes of 3 kg/cm2, made them unsuitable for supporting the load, forcing them to devise or adopt a system capable of limiting the pressure without, however, reducing the flow (Fassitelli, 1972). The need had in fact increased with the spread of wealth and especially at the most luxurious residences where decorative fountains became the distinctive element of wealth (Fig. 1). In fact: '[...] It seems that it is not only due to chance that no less than eight dwellings with rich decorative fountains belong to Regio VI, as opposed to between one and three in the other regiones, and that of these seven no less than four overlook Mercury Street. It can be observed that the extreme proximity of the castellum aquae of Porta Vesuvio and the steep slope of the road in the opposite direction to that of the castellum, must have facilitated the distribution of water in this regio, main due to the extent of its carriageway and its commercial importance (Fig. 2). Those who lived there must probably have become rich through trade and poured much of their wealth into the decorative apparatus, in which a privileged place was given to water,' (Anon, n.d.). In this last clarification insists the key to the reflections and findings aimed at recognising and critically recording the interrelationships established between the design of the urban blocks and the implementation of an urban water network, whose primary conduits were directly accessible from the running quays on the sides of the streets: a disposition imposed by the frequent need to replace conduits and pipes that were progressively and rapidly obstructed by calcium carbonate concretions that the low circulation pressure favoured inside them. This was the main reason for the new urban layout dictated not by the demand for drinking water, which had to be available even to the most modest dwellings, but for water to be destined for the fountains of the residences of the new rich, as an emblematic manifestation of their fortune. From the connection to the aqueduct branched the urban water supply, which before being introduced into the city was decanted into a large pool. The pool, known as a limaria, whatever its type, in fact doubled the capacity of an aqueduct, storing enormous For Pompeii, estimating its population at around 20,000 inhabitants and raising its per capita water consumption to that of a contemporary citizen of Rome, the demand would have been around 10,000 cubic metres, slightly less than the volume of the Piscina Mirabilis in Miseno, or the similar one, still in service, in Albano. But of such an artefact, there is no trace so far, leaving us to believe that the flow into the city from the water distributor, to which the task of purifying the water coming from the Serino was also delegated, was sufficient to meet the needs (Fig. 3). Since for the Romans the flow rate was proportional to the cross-section of the canal, the organ for distribution, generically called castellum aquae, was in fact a construction subdivided into several small basins, geometrically equal, with the three-compartment type being the most widely adopted. A specimen is preserved in perfect condition in Pompeii, which is therefore called a water tripartite: in it, the incoming flow was made to expand in a special wide and shallow circular basin and divided into three equal streams, by means of special masonry rises and from there channelled to feed a conduit. The distributor was installed at the highest point of the city, near Porta Vesuvio, at an altitude of 42.30 m, thus taking advantage of maximum prominence, so that no point in the city was excluded from the distribution of the network (Adam & Varène, 2008). According to De aquae ductu urbis Romae by the senator Sextus Julius Frontinus in charge of Rome's water supply, of the three conduits generally constructed, the first was intended for public fountains, the second for the baths, and the third for private users, who contributed to the maintenance costs of the entire urban network with their income [Frontinus (Orsini 1805)]. However, given that the guides through which the interception sluice gates flowed, with which a single section could be closed, if necessary, it would seem logical to assume that the primary castellum acquae had the function of distributing the water to the three distinct branches of the network mentioned above; a hypothesis that is in some way confirmed by the heights of the piezometric towers located along the city streets. A system, therefore, of distribution by regiones and not by specific users, as the many unauthorised connections directly connected to the reservoirs above the turrets, not unlike the legitimate ones, without anyone being able to prevent them, would seem to testify. As for the turrets, referred to by the Romans as castela aquae secundaria and by us as piezometric turrets, there are about 11 of them in the already excavated part of the city, and at least another 3-4 are thought to be in the remaining, still buried part. Completely devoid of pipes and reservoirs, these turrets were erected to keep the operating pressure always below 1 kg/cm2 at any point in the city, regardless of its altitude. In practice, they acted as pressure limiters: the approximately 1-square metre tank, covered and placed at the top of the turrets at a height of approximately 6 m, accumulated the water that flowed into it from an ascending pipe (coming from the distributor or from the previous turret), feeding a second descending pipe into the next one. The ingenious device thus ensured that the pressure in the pipes never exceeded the pressure produced by the height of a single turret, which was therefore about 0.6 kg/cm2, compatible with their resistance. At the foot of the turrets or, more rarely, in their immediate vicinity were the major public fountains, the minor ones being some forty metres away. The supply of the former was provided not only by the pipe at the bottom of the tank, but also by the water overflowing from it. With respect to the public fountains, no dwelling was more than 50 metres away. Evidence that the urban network was divided into independent branches includes the altimetrical survey of the bases of the turrets. This, highlighting that some of them are located at the same elevation above sea level, would make the cascade arrangement nonsensical, as would the others that precede them in the succession at a lower elevation. It follows, therefore, the confirmation that there are several branches, presumably three, if the characters of the primary castellum acquae are observed. Regardless of the greater or lesser difference in height, the turrets ensured a limited pressure, independent of the aqueduct's flow rate and essentially identical at every point in the city. The constant flow rate in the pipes was a function of their diameter and, above all, of the relative distance from the castellum aquae. The first turrets, in fact, were not affected by the eventual and inevitable flow rate reductions The first turrets, in fact, were not affected by the eventual and inevitable reductions in the flow rate of the subject aqueduct on its upper edge, leaving the supply to the public fountains, whose pipes were grafted onto the bottom of the reservoirs, unaffected. The dimensions of the longitudinally soldered lead pipes are described in detail in chapter 26 of Frontino's text: these are not measurements of the diameter, as the geometric section is not circular but pear-shaped, but of the width of the lead sheet, which by curvature generated them with a precise maximum diameter. It should be noted, however, that we have no archaeological evidence of the largest ones, as not even modest fragments have ever been found. Perhaps they were never built, but more likely they were vandalically stolen when the excavations began, as it was more profitable to remove them. The unit of measurement of the Roman aqueducts was the fistula quinaria, a 3 m long pipe, made from a sheet of metal about 5/4 of a finger wide (before being bent), hence the name, corresponding to about 1.25 inches in diameter, itself equal to 23 mm; the flow rate has been estimated at 0.483 litres per second, or 41.5 m3 per day (Fig. 4) (Fenizio & Claudio, 1947). Considering that the new Serino aqueduct, completed in 1885, had a daily flow rate of 170,000 cubic metres, with a minimum of 2 cubic metres per second, we are not far from the truth if we assume that the flow rate of the ancient Roman aqueduct, which drew from the same springs as the Serino, was not much lower. It can therefore be deduced that a rate of around 20,000 cubic metres withdrawn during the day would not affect the per capita requirement of around 500 litres at all. Approximately 7 litres per second would have passed through each branch, capable of cascading to the successive towers and thus to the entire water network. The estimate, if contracted in the flow rate, obliged more conusumi guaranteed by the many spanners that in fact penalised the lower parts of the city, those inhabited by the less well-off. This last observation must be considered one of the main concauses of the concentration of the domus of the wealthiest citizens close to the first turrets, those that would never have left them dry, thus justifying the unique social characterisation of the Regiones.",

    "abstract": "",
    "full_text": "This paper discusses the development of could be called the 'religious landscape' of Pompeii in the long last century of the city's existence. It does so with the aim of assessing how the actual material remains of permanent religious structures can be used to explore the relation between urban development and religious change. The argument will build upon developments in scholarship about Roman urban space, which has become increasingly sensitive to the micro-histories of everyday life, particularly -for better and for worse -at Pompeii. Starting from the definitive incorporation of Pompeii in Rome's empire in 80 BCE, it will explore to which extent we can actually trace the way in which Pompeii's religious landscape changed in the early imperial period, and how such a narrative of spatial change can be linked to (or rather reflects) changes in religious practice. This, in turn, can hopefully add a new dimension to scholarship about religion in Pompeii, and make the debate more sensitive to the reality of chronological change and its complex impact on the religious landscape, and religious practice. There is a substantial bibliography on the archaeology of religious life at Pompeii, covering both the monumentalization of temples and other cult facilities in public space, and the material remains of ritual in the domestic sphere. In recent decades, William van Andringa's 2009 monograph is both the most ambitious and most detailed discussion of the archaeology of religious practice in Pompeii (and Herculaneum), and sketches a vivid picture of a city where 'the gods were everywhere'. (Anon, n.d.) More importantly, Van Andringa was the first to develop a true 'archaeology of religion' at Pompeii: in line with developments in other branches of Pompeian studies, his approach moved beyond the traditional Pompeianist emphasis on architecture and art by incorporating a much larger number of evidence types, such as remains of altars and artefact assemblages. This made it possible to cover a much broader spectrum of religious practice. At the same time, Van Andringa was, remarkably enough, the first to present a more-or-less integrated analysis of the various sets and contexts of religious practice in Pompeii. Indeed, most scholarship touching upon religious life at Pompeii uses the city as a case study as part of an analysis of one, more limited, aspect of religious practice. In this way, Flower's recent book on the Roman lares uses the street altars of Pompeii to discuss how religion operated at the Roman street corner. (Anon, n.d.) Similarly, Gradel uses the evidence from Pompeii in his discussion of the nature of emperor worship in Roman Italy. (Anon, n.d.) However, from the perspective of the present argument, most of this scholarship suffers from two shortcomings. In the very first place, discourse on religious practice in Pompeii has overwhelmingly approached the city from a cultural systems perspective, thus not only quietly (or even explicitly) assuming that Pompeii in its cultural whereabouts reflected an average Roman (provincial) town -an extremely problematic idea in itself, given the exceptionally un-typical history of the bay of Naples region -but also supposing an absence of historical change: in these approaches, what we see at Pompeii was not a very specific reflection of local, regional, Roman, and pan-Mediterranean developments in religious practice, but simply reflects the way things worked in Roman Italy. Only in those domains of religion that are closely associated with the political sphere, some degree of change is acknowledged -e.g. as a result of the foundation of the colony in 80 BCE, and following the emergence of emperor worship in the Augustan period. Otherwise, change is off the conceptual table. It will be argued in this paper that this is a very problematic position. The second issue with most extant literature on religious practice at Pompeii is that it has a certain tendency to study religious practice and religious facilities independently of their physical urban environment. Thus, while it has been argued that 'religion' was omnipresent in Pompeii, its actual position in the urban landscape remains underexplored -even by Van Andringa, who offers some contextual analysis, at points, but who does not thematically address the role of religious practice in shaping urban space at large. Yet, it is important to acknowledge that the reverse is also true: there has been only limited interest in religion from the side of scholars studying the dynamics of Pompeii's urban landscape. For instance, while Laurence's monograph on space and society in Roman Pompeii briefly touches upon the spatial distribution of street altars, the interpretative emphasis lies with the role these altars play in keeping together the neighbourhood. (Anon, n.d.) More recent work by Hartnett and Poehler equally engages with religion only to a very limited extent.foot_3 Thus, while social and commercial life play a central role in discourse on urban space at Pompeii, religion remains a marginal phenomenon. Outside Pompeii, some work on urban religious landscapes has been done at Ostia, by Marlis Arnhold and Katherine Crawford, but given the nature of the material remains in Rome's port town, this has a strong focus on monumental (public) architecture, rather than on the whole spectrum of religious practices. (Anon, n.d.) This paper will discuss ways to address these issues, and will present a tentative reconstruction of the way in which the role of religious structures and facilities in urban space changed in the last century BCE and the first century CE. This will not be a straightforward process as the evidence is relatively badly preserved, and often resists clear dating. Nevertheless, it is possible to discuss some basic directions of development. This paper will distinguish developments in the spread and embedding of religious structures and facilities at three different spatial levels, which represent three different spheres of agency and social interaction. The analysis will start in the domestic sphere, and will then discuss the level of the neighbourhood before looking at the level of the community as a whole. It will be argued that one key development in Pompeii's urban landscape in this period -at all three spatial levels -is an increased presence of permanent religious structures and facilities in urban space, and thus, an increasingly dense urban religious landscape. This, in turn, will be a starting point for discussing the question of religious change, and the role of archaeology in highlighting it. By means of introduction, however, the argument will start with a brief outline of the history of Pompeii and its urban landscape. When Pompeii was ordered to receive a colony of Sullan veterans in 80 BCE, the city had a long history behind it. Walls, city gates, and parts of the street grid had been around since the sixth century BCE, though few of the standing (domestic) structures can be dated back securely to earlier than the third century BCE. It is clear, however, that right from the earliest period of its existence, Pompeii's urban landscape was decisively shaped by two major sanctuaries -one directly to the west of what quickly became the city's main plaza, and to the southeast of the city center. Throughout the pre-Roman history of Pompeii, or at least until the very late second century BCE, these two temples would be the city's main public sanctuaries. Yet, the city around these sanctuaries grew, gradually, throughout the third and early second century BCE, and more spectacularly from about 140 BCE onwards, when an influx of wealth fostered the emergence of a rather prosperous elite, which was responsible for what has been referred to as 'Pompeii's golden century (Anon, n.d.) This period saw major private and public construction works on a scale not seen, in this period, elsewhere in Italy. It more or less concludes with the Sullan colony, and the related transformation of the city centre in the following decades, which saw the construction of a second theatre, an amphitheatre, a second complex of public baths, and two major new temples -a temple for the Capitoline triad at the north end of the forum, and an enormously monumental temple for Venus Pompeiana in the south-west part of the city, overlooking the Sarno Estuary.foot_6 It may be observed that this last temple was very visible for people approaching the city, but occupied a marginal position in the urban landscape, cut off from the urban environment by a large wall, and bypassed by all major traffic routes. Exactly the same had been true, from the start, for the temple in the southeast corner of the city centre. Moreover, the temple of Apollo, although centrally located and readily accessible, was surrounded by a precinct that visually separated it from the forum. Thus, after the foundation of the colony, the city's religious landscape had become more complex, but also more strongly focused, as it was now dominated by one very visible temple: the Capitolium at the head of the forum. This paper focuses on the developments following the transformations associated with the foundation of the colony. For Pompeii as a whole, this period seems to have been one of gradual urban growth, both within and beyond the city walls. Along the west and south edge of the city, a sequence of elite houses emerged with large terraces overlooking the Bay of Naples, and the immediate environment of the city became densely occupied with suburban elite villas. However, throughout the city, changes to the urban landscape were not as radical as they had been in the preceding century. Nevertheless, besides the gradual, organic development of the city, there were two major causes of more substantial change. The first of these is the arrival of the emperor as the key figure in the political spectrum, which from the Augustan period onwards began to transform the ideological articulation of the city's public landscape. (Anon, n.d.) The second cause of change appeared in the 60s CE, when Pompeii was struck by at least one major earthquake and probably a range of smaller earthquakes and aftershock, signalling a period of seismic upheaval that lasted right up to the 79 CE eruption.foot_8 Both events had, in very different ways, a substantial impact on Pompeii's landscape of religion. Moreover, both were also specific to Pompeii and the Vesuvian region. This is self-evident in the case of the seismic upheaval, but it may be argued that the physical proximity of Rome's imperial elite made the impact of the new regime significantly more acute in the bay of Naples area than in many other parts of Early Imperial Italy and the Roman world: local elites, and urban patrons, were well-connected to the senate or even to the emperor, and could use the cities around the Bay of Naples to do what they could no longer do in Rome itself: build public monuments. The strongly monumental development of fora at Pompeii, Cumae and Puteoli, and the benefactions of equites like Marcus Nonius Balbus and a Lucius Cornelius in Herculaneum and Surrentum respectively confirm this idea. (Anon, n.d.) Because of its privileged position in the Bay of Naples, Pompeii was able to develop into a city of aboveaverage prosperity, where, throughout the period under consideration here, buying power was not restricted to a small urban elite, but had spread over a much larger part of the urban population. The extent of this wealth is hard to quantify, but it is reflected both in the broad access of households to basic and more complex forms of decoration on walls and floors -the evidence suggests that, e.g. the market for fourth-style panel-pictures was dominated not by the elite, but by sub-elite and middling groups. 12 Thus, in a period in which urban life was characterized by significant seismic unrest, and many houses show clear evidence of one or more phases of repair works, a significant part of Pompeii's population retained access to complex forms of wall-decoration. While artefact assemblages of smaller dwellings have remained understudied compared to those of elite houses, those that have been studied also suggest that many households were able to build up relatively rich and varied sets of material possessions. (Anon, n.d.) Archaeobotanical remains from a sewer in Herculaneum have recently been used to argue that even diets of people living in modest upper floor apartments were remarkably varied.foot_11 Pompeii's religious landscape, thus, developed in a prosperous community that was situated at the heart of the Roman world, and maintained close connections with the Roman imperial elite. This, in other words, was a community that had the money and the connections to build itself an above-average set of religious monuments and facilities. It also was a community that, particularly in the decades preceding the 79 CE eruption, may disproportionally have felt the need to do so. Physical remains of religious facilities in domestic context predominantly have the form of niche altars that were embedded in walls. At Pompeii, these altars have been well studied, and catalogues were compiled by Boyce in the 1930s, and by (Anon, n.d.) As their work highlights, these niches were well-spread. They would typically be around 50cm high, and were often positioned between one and two meters above the floor; many had a ledge in the form of a projecting tile at their bottom level, and they could have an aedicula above the niche, in paint, stucco or stone; there could also be stuccoed columns on the side. Many altars were equipped with, and surrounded by paintings. Occasionally, these altars could take a more elaborate form, and either took up a larger proportion of the wall, or were built, as a separate structure, against the wall; in some cases, niche altars could be surrounded by elaborate paintings. A few houses had an entire room that was devoted to such facilities, but generally, domestic altars were a subordinate element in a larger room. A huge problem with virtually all of these altars is that they cannot be easily dated. That is to say, 'normal' Pompeian dating strategies do not work, and neither the catalogue of Boyce, nor that of Fröhlich includes dates. Obviously, the paintings on and around the altars do not conform to the canonical Pompeian styles, and this leaves archaeologists with few stylistic criteria for accurate dating. (Anon, n.d.) Moreover, even if the underlying wall is exposed, it is not always clear whether the niche is contemporary to the wall or, if not, when it should be dated: typical arguments such as building materials or construction techniques that work for walls, do not necessarily also work for niches. That being said, a number of observations can be made. In the first place, the number of niches with walls in first or second style decoration is exceptionally low, and when they occur, the niches are evidently later than the surrounding wall-decoration. A good example is the south wall of the garden of house IX 3, 2, which was initially decorated with a typical first-style sequence of panels and pilasters. At a later moment, one of the panels was partially replaced by a niche accompanied by paintings (fig. 1). 17 Secondly, in cases where the wall structure of a niche is visible, it is often clear that use has been made of bricks -either in constructing the aedicula on top of the niche, or in the reinforcements around the niche itself. This would point to a date somewhere in the period that is the focus of the present chapter. In many cases, this date is implied anyway by the construction date of the wall in which the niche had been carved out. Thus, even if detailed dating is problematic, there is something to say for the idea that a lot of these niches date to the Augustan period or the first century CE, and there are reasons to assume that the number of permanent altars in domestic contexts was lower in the preceding period. The more elaborate structures particularly seem to be of a late date. Again, none of these can be found in combination with first-or second style wall-decoration, and many either have been constructed with large amounts of brick, or were placed against a wall in opus vittatum mixtum, opus latericium, or another building technique pointing to the first century CE. One example is the altar in the atrium of house VII 14, 5, which was constructed, with opus vittatum mixtum in the last decades of the city's existence (fig. 2). (Anon, n.d.) The altar in the atrium of the House of the Menander (I 10, 4) also dates to this period (fig. 3), as does the altar in the house of Caecilius Iucundus (V 1, 22). There are multiple ways to understand this picture, and they do not necessarily exclude each other. There is of course the possibility that many of the altars that were made in the first century CE replaced predecessors that simply have left no trace, even though this is hard to reconcile with the lack of examples -and indeed models -for such altars in the second and first centuries BCE. It is also possible that the increased wealth of people at Pompeii translated itself into a monumentalization of ritual facilities in the domestic sphere, so that altars were no longer portable, or of perishable material, but fixed and permanent. Technology may also have played a role in the sense that the increasing role of bricks and mortar in everyday building practice simply made it easier and cheaper to have these altars constructed. For example, it was considerably more difficult, and risky, to carve a niche out of a wall in traditional opus africanum, which does not use mortar, than it was to do this in the opus incertum walls that were constructed from the mid second century BCE onwards. At the same time, structural developments in religious practice also may have contributed, even though for Pompeii, these can hardly be assessed through other sources than these very altars. It is, however, important to note that many of the altars were not simply built in the first century but quite specifically belong to the period of the fourth style, which coincides with the two decades in which Pompeii suffered considerably from earthquakes. Indeed, it surely is no coincidence that one of our best iconographic sources for the seismic upheaval -the earthquake frieze from the house of Caecilius Iucundus -comes from a domestic altar (fig. 4). It is possible, though hard to prove or quantify, that the events of the 60s and 70s CE stimulated Pompeian households to invest in religious infrastructure so as to repair (or safeguard) the pax deorum that they probably saw as threatened. The material remains of religious infrastructure in Pompeian neighbourhoods -that is to say, at the street corners, on façades, and in the parts of houses that were exposed to the outside world -do not differ, archaeologically, so much from the altars and aedicula that could be found inside houses. Typically, they would consist of a modestly sized altar of ca. 50-70 cm high, placed against the façade or side wall of a house, and surrounded by often quite substantial paintings with religious and ritual imagery. Occasionally, the structure would be a little bit more elaborate, or the remains would be limited to paintings. Besides this 'infrastructure', façades could, and in some cases were used for religious imagery, by depicting gods, ritual scenes, or more abstract symbols of religious significance -including a substantial number of phalluses. Methodologically, the same issues and problems apply: the evidence is to some extent specific on religious functionality, but very weak in terms of dating. More than is the case with houses, our knowledge is also influenced negatively by the history of excavations at Pompeii, which meant that at least some of the evidence has disappeared unrecorded after excavation in the parts of the city that were excavated before ca. 1860, when proper recording began in earnest. This has particularly harmed our understanding of the spread of façade paintings, which are only really well known in the zone of the Scavi Nuovi of the 1910s -basically, this comes down to the eastern half of the Via dell'Abbondanza. (Anon, n.d.) Altars have been spared by the elements, so that it is at least possible to reconstruct a map with their spread over the urban topography -as Ray Laurence has done.foot_17 However here, too, the best preserved examples are limited to the Scavi Nuovi area, though several 19 th century drawings give a rough idea of what has been lost in some high-profile situations elsewhere in the city. (Anon, n.d.) However, compared to the domestic altars, there is quite a bit of evidence suggesting that semi-public street altars, as a phenomenon, went back to the first century BC or even earlier. For instance, the altar in VIII 4, 24 seems situated in a room that was designed for this specific purpose when the east wing of the Domus Cornelia, to which it belonged, was built in the early first century BCE. Flanking the Via Stabiana, this wing included a row of six shops, followed by a back entrance to the Domus Cornelia, and, at the south end of the complex, a small room, with a narrow entrance, which housed the small altar (fig. 5). While the present altar is not necessarily contemporary to the building, the room is too small to have been constructed as a shop. (Anon, n.d.) At the same time, the proportion of altars directly associated with building materials and techniques from the early imperial period is surprisingly limited. Indeed, many altars basically consisted of a block of Sarno Stone -a local, very porous travertine that dominated Pompeian construction practice until the mid-second century BC -placed in upright position, and in most cases, this wall is made of late-Republican building techniques. In some cases, later alterations offer a terminus ante quem: the small altar on the northwest corner of insula IX 8 was originally made of a Sarno Stone block, but was subsequently expanded with opus vittatum simplex, a technique that appears to by typical for the second half of the first century BCE (fig. 6). A few blocks away, a similar altar became embedded in the outer wall of the Central Baths, the construction of which began somewhere in the 60s or 70s CE, suggesting that, even though the pre-existing buildings in the insula were all demolished, the altar needed to be kept in place (fig. 7). (Anon, n.d.) Thus, the spatial distribution of street altars at Pompeii may have remained more or less stable throughout the later first century BCE and the first century CE. It is harder to assess whether the same is also true for the paintings surrounding the altars. In several cases it is clear that the paintings that made it to 79 CE were not very old, as they covered sections of the wall behind the altars that dated to the first century CE, but it is of course unclear what these paintings looked like earlier on. The development of the visual presence of street altars can thus not really be assessed. However, there is an argument to be made that what happened on façades in terms of religious imagery (independent of the street altars) was predominantly a phenomenon of the first century CE. This is not only because Fröhlich dated these paintings overwhelmingly to the period of the fourth style -and thus to the last two decades of Pompeii's existence, but also because this ties in nicely with broader developments in walldecoration, which point to an increasing proliferation of arrangements with multiple colours and anatomically complex figures throughout the social hierarchy, increasingly including also the mediumsized households responsible for façades with religiously explicit paintings. (Anon, n.d.) Even if the 79 CE religious topography of street altars at Pompeii had roots in the first century BCE or earlier, one could argue that the development of the façade as a communicative medium in the first century CE transformed the way in which religious practice was present in Pompeian streets. However, this point is relative rather than absolute: the spread of this religious symbolism was both spatially, and socially, uneven and always remained limited. It is essential to note that none of the street altars was ever directly associated with the monumental tufa façades of the large domestic, public, and commercial buildings that lined the streets of Pompeii along their most high-profile sections. Façade paintings, at the same time, were almost universally associated with small-to medium sized houses, and never with elite villas -the change, in this respect, clearly came from below. Topographically, even accounting for biases caused by excavation and preservation, these paintings were rare alongside the major throughroutes of the city, including the Via Stabiana, the western Via dell'Abbondanza, and the Via della Fortuna, which were dominated by the second century BCE tufa façades; there is only a small number of nineteenth century reports for façade paintings. Still, these developments contributed to a denser landscape of religious symbolism in parts of the city. Alongside the façades and the street altars, it is important not to overlook the fact that, by the first century BCE, Pompeii's streets had become lined with tabernae, which, with their broad openings were strongly integrated into the neighbourhood atmosphere: whatever happened inside these tabernae was within sensory reach of people on the street, and this is not only true for the work taking place in these establishments, but also for their religious infrastructure. Over the course of the first century CE, the number of tabernae along the streets of Pompeii only seems to have increased. Not all tabernae had an altar niche in one of their walls, but many had, and these would often be situated in a fairly visible place. In some cases, these lararia were associated with elaborate paintings, which occasionally can be seen to clearly communicate with the outside world. (Anon, n.d.) It is very hard to say whether this phenomenon increased in the first century CE; most altars remained rather small and have left chronologically aspecific remains. Yet the general development of having more tabernae in Pompeii undoubtedly contributed to this phenomenon becoming a bit more common. Finally, there is the role of religious infrastructure that was serving the urban community as a whole. As argued earlier in this paper, a basic set of key temples had emerged by the middle of the first century BCE. These temples, of course, continued to exist. It could perhaps be argued that the temple at the head of the forum over time lost a little bit of its visual prominence, as the forum plaza was filling up with statues and other civic monuments, and the temple became surrounded by honorific arches on both sides. The temple of Venus Pompeiana was completely being rebuilt in 79 CE, but this does not seem to have affected its position within the city. On the whole, these four temples remained stable, and continued to be defining elements in Pompeii's religious landscape, and in the urban landscape more in general. The small second century BCE temple along the Via Stabiana, which has long been associated with Iuppiter Meilichios but probably was dedicated to Aesculapius, also simply continued to exist without any dramatic changes to its spatial position. (Anon, n.d.) The same is true for the temple of Isis, which was founded at its present location in the second century BCE and, while completely rebuilt in the 60s and 70s CE, continued to occupy the same (marginal) position in the urban landscape. Yet in spite of this continuity, the public religious landscape of Pompeii was significantly transformed from the Augustan era onwards. Well known is the transformation of the east side of the forum, which had been lined with shops since the third century BCE. These shops were removed from the Augustan period onwards, together with some of the houses behind them, to make place for a new set of public monuments (fig. 8). The first of these, the so-called 'Building of Eumachia', in fact was dedicated in its building inscription to Concordia Augusta and Pietas. (Anon, n.d.) Even if no identifiable altar has been preserved in the building (there certainly was place for one), the religious connotations of its dedication are explicit, and are made even stronger by the association of the entire complex with the Porticus of Livia in Rome, which included a temple for Concordia. (Anon, n.d.) The religious nature of the two buildings north of the Porticus of Eumachia is more straightforward. Neither of these buildings has been identified with universal agreement but both were organized around an altar. The nature of the small temple precinct directly north of the Porticus of Eumachia is disputed -most scholars assume that it had something to do with Augustus, and the question is whether it is related to his Genius or to himself -but its date -early in the first century CE -is not. (Anon, n.d.) Further to the north, a larger, completely opened, structure in recent years also has been associated with emperor worship. The date is fiercely debated. Dobbins has argued that the building must have been constructed after the 62/63 CE earthquake, others have argued for an earlier date. (Anon, n.d.) In terms of building techniques, it clearly distinguishes itself from the two buildings south of it. Van Andringa has identified the complex as being dedicated to the domus divina, others have seen it as an 'Imperial Cult Building'. (Anon, n.d.) However, more important than the dedication of the temple is the way in which it was imposed on the forum plaza. Not only was the main room completely open on its front side, its side walls also extended significantly towards the plaza compared to the surrounding buildings. Moreover, the disposition of the columns in front of the building deviates from the main colonnade along the west side of the forum. Whatever its precise function was, this building was designed to visually dominate the forum plaza, and its construction therefore not only strengthened the religious infrastructure of the forum area, but also its role in the landscape. One possibility that should not be discounted too easily is that its construction does not reflect the generally increased role of emperor worship, but rather reflects a local response to imperial assistance following the devastating earthquake that struck the city in the early 60s CE. All in all, the east side of the forum transformed from a mostly commercial zone to a zone dominated by religious infrastructure and symbolism -even if this modified the nature of commerce taking place in this area rather than completely removed it, and this had a significant impact on the overall character of the forum. Particularly, it may be noted that the east side of the forum is the side that is best integrated into the urban movement network: the eastern porticus offered the easiest and most comfortable connection between the busy Via dell'Abbondanza and the equally busy Via di Mercurio and Via Consolare. (Anon, n.d.) A major intervention outside the direct environment of the forum was the construction of the temple of Fortuna Augusta on the corner of the Via della Fortuna and the Via del Foro (fig. 9). Urbanistically, this is perhaps the most interesting intervention of the early imperial period. The new temple was constructed in a place previously occupied, in all probability, by a house. It was constructed on private land by a certain Marcus Tullius, in the Augustan period, as the dedicatory inscription makes clear. (Anon, n.d.) The temple is a classic, frontal podium temple, and its orientation has been slightly adapted: the building has been turned northward at an angle of approximately 3° compared to the Via della Fortuna. This significantly enhanced the visibility of the temple for people moving towards Pompeii's centre from the Via Consolare, and gave public religion a spectacular presence in an area where, up to the Augustan period, it had been completely absent. Obviously, as was true for the development of the east side of the forum, there were several things going on at the same time, not in the least, again, the changing political world within which the Pompeian was operating, and the gradual monumentalization of Pompeii's urban landscape as a whole. Indeed, the construction of this temple can be seen in direct relation to the development of the Via Consolare as the most monumentalized access route to the city, which also was reflected in the Porta Ercolano, constructed in the thirties BCE as the largest and most monumental gate of the city. This paper has assessed the historical development of the urban landscape of religion in early imperial Pompeii at three different levels. While at each level, the assessment of the evidence is complicated, and caution is needed, the evidence seems to point to a similar direction. At the very least, this highlights the importance of understanding the 79 CE landscape of religion at Pompeii in its specific historical context: the urban archaeology of religion in Pompeii was not only a product of its time in the broader sense, it also was profoundly influenced by the particular historical trajectory of Pompeii and its urban community in the first centuries BCE and CE -the reconstruction of the temple of Isis after its earthquake collapse, and the frieze of the lararium in the house of Caecilius Iucundus pointing to probably the same event can be taken to symbolize this, perhaps together with the Imperial Cult Building on the forum, if it should be dated so late. On top of this, it could be argued that the evidence suggests that Pompeii's urban landscape became increasingly packed with religious infrastructure and symbolism in the period between Augustus and 79 CE, at all three levels: within houses, along the streets, and in the city center. The question, of course, is what to make of this, and in which way these changes meaningfully contribute to thinking about the 'urban archaeology of religion', or about the history of Roman religion more in general. One point to emphasize in this respect is that developments in the spatial presence of religious infrastructure and symbolism need to be seen in the broader context of the transformations to the spatial configuration of Roman urbanism in the early imperial period. As many people have observed, the first century CE is a key period for urban development in Roman Italy, with urban elites spending considerably on urban infrastructure, urban amenities, and urban monuments, and with urban communities reciprocating the honour by granting them statues in public places, and funerary monuments in prominent locations along the streets to and from their cities. (Anon, n.d.) This resulted in urban landscapes that were increasingly full of monuments and, indeed, community narratives. At Pompeii, the forum developed into a store of community memory, full with statues of locals who in some way or another had played a role in the development (and resilience) of the city. Just outside the Porta Ercolano and, as has recently become clear, the Porta Stabia, monumental tombs told similar stories -often to great detail. At the same time, many of the façade paintings not just referred to religious practice, but also illustrated the city's economic life, as did the increasing commercialization of urban space in general. Inside houses, iconography began to play a central role in decoration from the Augustan period onwards, both on wall paintings, and through marble furniture. Thus, the spread of religious infrastructure and symbolism was part of a much broader phenomenon in which urban space became increasingly full with all kinds of visual impulses and narratives, and this may have impacted upon the way in which individual elements in the landscape were experienced or, even, noticed. Secondly, it is arguably possible that the developments in Pompeii's religious landscape, or some of them, were rooted in changes to religious practice, but the problem remains that it is very hard to actually prove this. Partially, this is the result of the (at least potentially) prominent role of the locally specific factors that have been mentioned above. More in general, religious practice is too complex to simply assume that increasing archaeological visibility or changing strategies of construction and decoration come from historically meaningful changes in urban religious practice -the best illustration, perhaps, is the question as to whether the emergence of emperor worship, and the resulting changes to the public landscape in the forum area should be seen as a religious development rather than a political one. Perhaps, therefore, it could be suggested the question about the origins of these developments is illposed, and the more promising question concerns the consequences of the changing religious landscape. Arguably, an increase in religious infrastructure increases the possibilities for worship and other forms of religious action, and an increase in religious symbolism adds to the possibilities for religious experience and contemplation. Essentially, the stages upon which religion could be performed multiplied, and spread over the urban landscape, and by their very existence created a need for, and an expectation of religious practice. Moreover, particularly at the level of domestic altars, or the niches in the walls of tabernae, the appearance of such infrastructure also created a model for religious practice that could be followed by others: in a way, what we are seeing may even result from a self-supporting religious 'dialogue' taking place within the Pompeian community, with people following each other's example in producing permanent facilities and narratives of religious practice. Thus, is it possible to come to an urban archaeology of religious history? At Early Imperial Pompeii, with its unique archaeological record, there are clear possibilities to assess the changing position of religious practice in the urban landscape, and there is evidence suggesting that, yes, developments were taking place, and, yes, these had consequences for the way religion could be enacted and experienced. At the same time, this paper has highlighted the interpretative difficulties that come with the nature of the evidence even at the best-preserved archaeological site of the Roman world. The key problem at Pompeii is essentially twofold. On the one hand, while the objects and assemblages of the 79CE finds record give (at least occasionally) very specific information about everyday religious practice in the first century CE, they lack the time-depth necessary to assess chronological development; on the other hand, the architectural remains of altars and shrines do offer a bit of time-depth, but they are a much weaker source for assessing actual religious practice. This poses limits on the historical argument that can be derived from such remains. Still, this paper argues that the changing religious landscape as reflected in these architectural remains offers some glimpses of a development that made that religious practice became a physically much more widespread aspect of everyday urban space.

The case study presented is the streets network of Pompeii: its north-east/south-west axes are oriented according to the solstices, in a secundum caelum no-cardinal direction (Cristofaro & Silani, 2020). According to Henrich Nissen (1869)'s foundation day theory, Pompeii was founded on the day of summer solstice. This hypothesis is reviewed in the context of later studies on archeoastronomy and urbanism. In parallel, this precise choice of orientation may be interpreted through the lens of Gaetano Vinaccia's equisolar theory, being the sun an important microclimatic factor. The solstitial urban grid is explored through the equalisation of sunlight among all the four sides of building blocks for an annual equilibrate solar irradiation (Anon, n.d.). Beyond Nissen's foundation day theory, the role of solstices at Pompeii might be also read according to Vinaccia's solar irradiation theory for temperate climate. This would bring to consider a logical, rational, and functional idea of city, also related with the observation and integration of the sky, where the religious and ritual aspects of setting boundaries and diving space according to cosmological principles seems not in contradiction but in complementary dichotomy. In Pompeii foundation, urban pattern and morphology may be read as part of an environmental design related to orientation rules for a rationalised sun exposure, as well as the result of a foundation ritual act. This contribution is placed within a wider research investigating urban morphology and orientation in ancient Campania between the 8th and the 3rd cent. BC 1 , focusing here on Pompeii urban morphology. In particular the urban grids on the ancient Campanian plain seems to follow a specific pattern (Rescigno & Senatore, 2009) to be further investigated in the context of astronomical orientations. Within the method of skyscape archaeology, here the discourse will be drawn from the archaeological evidence and the literary sources available. On the topic of ancient land division, the writing of the Gromatici Veteres are a unique corpus of information: the gromatic writers lived in the Imperial period, even though the original theory of space division can be dated back of six centuries at least, reaching on Etruscan or Italic planning where no or little sources are available (Anon, n.d.). However, there are problems of interpretation in the Gromatici Veteres corpus including the complex stratigraphy in the transmission of the manuscripts and the very technical terms used to be also considered. A distinction between the secundum caelum or secundum natura orientation can be traced depending if the urban planning reflected the sky directions or the geomorphological terrain specificity (Cataldi, 2003)(Anon, n.d.). Often, this dichotomy is not in contrast, even though an urban plan can be read as the result of a prevailing rationale. In the context of secundum caelum procedures, it is possible to distinguish between cardinal 2 and no-cardinal orientation, being the latter more complex to be recognised, since \"east\" might have been considered as \"any position of the sun rising\", thus changing across the year (Anon, n.d.). Moreover, the arc of the sun rising depends on the latitude and considerations over large territories should take in account such difference (Anon, n.d.). In the 19th century, a relationship between the position of the rising sun aligned with the urban main street and the foundation day was proposed by Henrich (Anon, n.d.): he is considered the father of archaeoastronomy and, since his analysis on Pompeii, he was inspired to elaborate his work on the templum regarding the orientation of 1 The doctoral project is carried out at Capys Laboratory at Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli under the coordination of Prof. Carlo Rescigno, with the collaboration of Dr. Michele Silani, Dr. Frank Prendergast, and Dr. Georg Zotti. To them I wish to express my sincere gratitude, as well as to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii for enabling the present research to be carried out. 2 For finding cardinal directions using the sun and a centred gnomon within a circle, the shadow of the pole could be marked before and after midday (Vitr. De Arch. 1.6.6). ancient temples and towns in Italian peninsula and the Mediterranean area. His theoretical framework has been subjected to some critiques, notably by Joell Le (Eckstein et al., 1975) in his paper Les Romains et l'Orientation Solaire. Moreover, for urban grid where a secundum caelum orientation is evinced, a different interpretation should be explored in accordance to a solar irradiation rationale: in the context of \"planning for the sun\" climatic urbanism of the 19th-20th century, Pompeii can be read through the lens of Gaetano Vinaccia's equisolar orientation. Starting for the results previously achieved (Cristofaro & Silani, 2020), the scope here is to explore the rational below the urban morphology of Pompeii and its no-cardinal secundum caelum solstitial orientation. This urban layout can be date back at least in the Hellenistic period, but it might have been traced already in the Archaic period if continuity in orientation between the pappamonte foundations and the later buildings is assumed. Thus, from the last research results (Cristofaro & Silani, 2020), it was emphasised that the main urban axes of Pompeii (fig. 1) are oriented according to a solstitial diagonalcirca 60°/240°, especially fitting for Via delle Terme (fig. 2). Nissen also mentioned the Apollo temple temenos transverse axis pointing at the sun rising at summer solstice, even though from recent cartographical vectoral representations the two orientations differ of circa 5°. Instead, it was pointed out that the orientation of the Archaic Doric Temple to be oriented according to the other solstitial diagonalcirca 120°/300° azimuthwith a more precise correspondence with summer solstice sunset (Anon, n.d.)(Cristofaro & Silani, 2020). Nissen stated that the axis of the temple, \"corresponds with the azimuth of the sunset on the day of foundation\" (Anon, n.d.). The intentionality of this solar pattern of orientations is emphasised by the dual presence of two solstitial diagonals, one drawn by the urban grid and the other by the Doric Temple axis at the Foro Grecofoot_0 . The presence of the heroon at the latter gives a further evidence of the importance of this place in the foundation ritual of the town. In a gaussian statistical frame, the dual presence of two independent solstitial diagonalsthe Doric temple and urban gridgives a probability that this set up is due to chance of 0.2% (Cristofaro & Silani, 2020). To progressively unfold the research, the following question to dealt with is to interpret such results without falling into an anachronistic bias. The investigation will explore Nissen's \"foundation day theory\" versus Gaetano Vinaccia's \"solar irradiation\" theory for interpreting the solstitial orientation put in light in Pompeii, in a dialectic between ritual and functional. To divide between the two spheres, religious and practical, would be misleading causing an unrealistic interpretation; instead, this is an attempt to show the possible complexity of meanings behind a secundum caelum urban orientation by trying to integrate the two rationales. Skyscape archaeology in urbanism has dealt with measurement of the orientationazimuthof the main axis of orthogonal ancient cities, especially in the context of Roman colonies. In archeoastronomical studies, some scholars have hypothesised that the main east-west axis of the cityoften called decumanus even though this is a modern attribution of the agrarian axis applied to the urban axisfoot_1 was related to the day of foundation as marked by the sun position aligned on the local horizon. Hyginus stated that the discipline of tracing boundaries derived from the sky (Hyg. Grom. Cons. Lim. 166, 1-6 L.). For Frontinus, multi mobilem solis ortum et occasum secuti uariarunt hanc rationem. sic uti[que] effectum est, ut decimani spectarent ex qua parte sol eo tempore, quo mensura acta est, oriebatur, \"many have followed the variable rising and setting of the sun and altered this principle. Indeed, they have arranged so that the decumani faced from the part (of the heavens) where the sun was rising at the time when the survey was carried out\" (Front. De limit. 31, 4-7 L. = 11, 37-39 C.). Thus, in recent scholarship urban orientation in space have been used to determine the ritual time of the foundation act. Some coincidences have been hypothesised as evinced by the position of the sun risingor settingat the horizon: the foundation day of the city might have corresponded to a special festivity or anniversary, such as the founder or emperor birthday (Anon, n.d.). This flow of idea can be traced back to the work by Henrich Nissen (1869: 166) at the end of the nineteenth century. It is necessary to remember that the parameters for the choice of the day of foundation is not known in ancient sources: therefore, a primary issue to be considered is the Natalis Urbis question. Specifically, there is a need to clarify which act in founding of a city was considered important to be celebrated as foundation anniversary. It is probable that Rome has been used as a model for Roman colonial planning (Piras 2013:303)foot_2 . Arthur M. Eckstein argued that in colonies the marking of the perimeter with the plough was the ritual act related to the factual foundation, as evinced from Roman coinage (Eckstein et al., 1975). Only for few Roman colonies their days of foundation is known. Among these, Amelia C. (Anon, 2020) tested the orientation of Brindisium with the orientation of the sun at the day of the historical reported anniversary, founding a good match. However, she suggested that calendric synchronisation with the Roman calendar is difficult and her result might have been caused by a confirmation bias. In his paper Les Romains et l (Anon, n.d.) pointed out some problems with Nissen's workflow and the secundum caelum no-cardinal orientation. Le Gall argued that a precise passage from Hyginus is usually cited but out of context, suggesting a different meaning than Nissen's interpretation. The passage states that surveyor sighted the rising sun to orient themselves with the ferramentum, the Roman surveyor instrument. The passage from Hyginus stated that Quid ergo? Posita auspicaliter groma, ipso forte conditore praesente, proximum vero ortum comprehenderunt, et in utramque partem limites emiserunt, quibus kardo in horam sextam not convenerit, «What takes place then? When the groma had been positioned after the taking of the auspices, perhaps in the presence of the very founder himself, they sighted the next sunrise, and established limites in both directions; but in this system the kardo did not tally with the sixth hour (i.e. did not face due south)» (Hyg. Grom. Cons. Lim. 170, 5-8 L. = 136, 19-1 C.). However, within its context, Hyginus is instead criticising surveyors who acted in this way because, according to the agrimensor, this was not the correct method from a theoretical perspective. Following the apparent rising position of the sun can be misleading since the celestial body rises on the horizon in a different position according to day of the year. Only at the equinox the sun may rise due east, but even this statement can be contradicted by the presence of mountains and hills on the horizon, as later discussed. Nevertheless, Le Gall stated that this is an advantageous factor, since the delimitation can be traced any day of the year (Le Gall 1975:307). As a final point in Hyginus' passage, there is the problem of the magnitude mundi, the size of the Earth (Hyg. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Hyginus stated that it is impossible to know the precise point of the sun setting or rising if there is a mountain in front of the ferramentum, since the sun is shining beyond the mountain, even though the latter casts shadow on the point of surveying. Although inconvenient under some theoretical prescriptions, it is possible that the sun might have been used in some occasions as a direct target to be sight aligning the two plum lines of the groma. If the survey was done at sunrise or sunset on a relatively flat horizon (less than 3°), the disk of the sun would have been easier to watch due to the reddish shade typical of the twilight, even though the 0.5° diameter of the disk would not have appeared at all as a punctiform target. It is also possible that the sun shadow was used for such survey with a vertical pole or gnomon: when the sun is low on the horizon, the shadow is the longest possible enhancing the correct marking of boundaries on the ground. Finally, the infinite distance of the sun in respect to a site would allow parallel lines to be traced allowing multiple surveying on a site, even though they should be taken on the same moment by sighing the sun. Going back to the critiques by Le Gall, he stated that, if \"east\" is regarded as the whole arc of the rising sun, the possibility that a solar position is found casually is 82%. This is caused by the fact that it is not possible to distinguish among what are called cardo and decumanus in Roman centuriation. There, he is referring to the possibility of inverse centuriation, such as in the case of ager Campanus. The rules ab oriente ad occasum, and ab meridiem ad septemtriones, can be reversed completely, with the cardo running from east to west. Aldo Prosdocimi dealt with this issue considering the late attribution of meaning of cardo as the hinge of the cosmos, that is the axis of rotation, acquiring major importance among the decumanus, the original line of division. According to Prosdocimi's theory, the etymology of line k/cardo would refer to «to cut» from Latin caro/carnis, since it was meant to cut the decumanus (Anon, n.d.)). Inverse centuriations found in south of Italy might be attributed to such translation of meanings, even though other interpretations have been pointed out. According to Rosada, in its maximum deviation possible such inversion is so hyperbolic to nullify itself, by returning, factually, to the normal cardinal arrangement (Anon, n.d.). Therefore, no exact method exists to distinguish among the two orthogonal axes from their original role. Thus, the fact that is a prerogative of the decumanus only to point at the risingor settingsun is also misleading. This leads Le Gall to schematise the arc of the horizon where an orientation axis might be theoretically found. If the fours arms of a crossthat is the typical schema of an orthogonal Roman urban gridare rotating causally in the 360° degrees of the horizon circle, there is just a little space left which does not fall within a solar rising position. He pointed out that the attribution of a foundation day after the alignment with the sun cannot be statistically significant. To answer such critique, a few groups of scholars have surveyed a consistent number of Roman town plans to put in light statistical trends against Le Gall's critiques. As a result, big scale data do not offer clear peaks in the statistical analysis, whereas single region case study tends to be more productive (Gonzaĺez-Garciá and Magli 2015). Moreover, Bradley Schaefer also suggested a useful workflow to prove any astronomical orientation after three conditions are satisfied, which were used to test the intentionality, or no-randomness, of Pompeii solstitial orientation (Cristofaro & Silani, 2020). To apply Nissen's \"foundation day\" theory starting from the spatiality of the urban grid, the two specular days when the sun rises are calculated, each symmetrical to the nearest solstitial position (Anon, n.d.) 6 . Among the two dates, the day which embrace the most appropriate archaeological and anthropological evidence is usually proposed as the foundation day. Giulio De Petra (1869), in a review of Nissen's theory, questioned the possibility of calendric conversion. To express the exact the day of the Roman calendar from a modern calculation can be challenging. In her analysis, (Anon, 2020) suggested that only solstices, cross-quarters, and equinox days can be considered plausibly relevant in the solar orientation of Roman colonies, whereas the match between a Roman festivity and the sun position is unprovable. On the contrary, according to César Gonzaĺez-Garciá and Giulio (Eckstein et al., 1975), \"the possibility of further deliberate orientations, for instance to the sun rising on certain days of the Roman festive calendar\", or \"an explicit reference or the date of birth of the town's founder\" (p.1647) should be further studied for no-cardinal or nosolstitial solar positions. Even though, on a previous contribution, Magli rejected the hypothesis of the alignment with the founder birthday given the presence of a no-random distribution (Anon, n.d.). In summary, if solstices and equinox are inherent astronomical events, any other solar positions can be considered relevant only if historically contextualised. In Pompeii, the focus is on solstitial orientation, thus the position is inherent to the solar cycle beyond calendric reckoning. Local calendars form the 7 th -6 th century are not available in Pompeii, being the Tabula Capuana the first attestation of a local Etruscan ritual calendar from circa 470 BC in ancient Campania. Following Nissen's theory, it might be stated that the foundation day of Pompeii in the turning of the 7 th cent. and 6 th cent. was summer solstice, being the main streets oriented towards this celestial phenomenon. Summer solstice is one of the two points of reference in the year, for instance in Classical Greece it marked the beginning of the new year. In Pompeii, every year, the sun returned in the same solstitial position, possibly the day of foundation, marking the anniversary of the birth of the town. According to this hypothesis, the urban grid functioned as a solar calendar, where sighting in space directs orientation in time, with the renewal of the cycle of the sun reflecting a new year of life in Pompeii. However, this flow of idea might be compared to a more functional idea of city, where the sun was not only a calendric marker but a climatic factor for the sustainability of life in the town. Cities showing a solstitial orientation in their grid might be explored beyond ritual and calendric intentions. In Pompeii, if the Doric Temple assured the ritual configuration of space and the annual renewal with the solar return of the sun aligned with the temple axis, the choice of the solstitial orientation of streets remains unclear. It is possible to speculate that the urban morphology acted as a calendric devise for the whole community, indicating the circuit of the sun across the sky, together with marking the anniversary of the city. Many are ancient cities are oriented according to solstices, especially in Roman urbanism (Anon, 2016)): Ostia, Como, Verona, Acerrae, Herculaneum, Rimini, Vicenza, Augusta Bagiennorum, Augusta Praetoria Salassorum -Aosta, Norba, Roman colonies in Spain, and Augusta Raurica, Vesontio, and Aventicum in the north-west Alps. In some of these cases, the view on the horizon is partially obstructed by mountains, which do not allow the whole course of the sun from its rising and setting, to be fully visible. In Herculaneum the east-west grid is oriented as in Pompeii, turned clockwise from the geographical north of around 60°. However, the Mt. Somma-Vesuvius stands in that direction, even though the exact morphology of the volcano in pre-79 AD eruption can be only hypothesised, it now obstructs the view of the summer solstice rising sun. In Verona, similarly, the view of summer solstice rising sun is not visible in line with the grid due to the Pre-Alps, and a similar situation happens in Como. Therefore, it seems that the sight of the sun itself was not the prevailing aim, so that it might be necessary to overcome the idea of \"observation\", and in particular \"astronomical observation\", in antiquity towards a more integrated and participatory aspect of the role of the sun. Indeed, other interpretations related to a more functional and rationale idea of town might be explored. Solar irradiation was a fundamental factor in ancient urbanism. In the treatise by Vitruvius can be found a practical version of urban foundations, which has struck scholars for the absence of any citations of ritual in respect to his contemporary writers (Anon, n.d.). This functional idea of town might be traced back to ancient Greece, with Plato's ideal city and the solar passive house attributed to Socrates. In the course of centuries, utopian models of cities were schematised or built, often related to the sun as the ideological centre. After the industrial revolution, there was the need for healthier and more functional cities, as well as houses, hospitals, and schools. For instance, Ralph Knowles stated that \"[t]he natural world appears to abound with examples of arrangements based in some measure on exposure to the sun…Our cities are non-directional. Our buildings are undifferentiated by orientation to the sun. They stand static, unresponsive to the rhythms of their surrounding\" (Anon, 1981). The attention for a microclimatic arrangement was brought to focus in urbanism. As Victor Olgyay pointed out \"[w]ith the development of techniques for measuring radiation and the accumulation of factual data, the approach to orientation was made on a calculative basis\" (Anon, n.d.). Such data analysis brought to the formulation of many solar-orientation theories. Thus, Gaston Bardet started his essay exposing the unending debate on the topic, since «[l]es idées les plus confuses et les plus contradictoires règnent en matière d'ensolleiment» (Anon, n.d.). For an historical overview of the many solutions proposed, the doctoral thesis by Maryleǹe Montavon is a very clear summary (Anon, n.d.). Many were the advocators of cardinal directions; the solutions with diagonal orientations have been less and with more variegated arrangements. Diagonal directions in the urban fabric were also the favourite in ancient Mesopotamia (Anon, n.d.). There, \" (Anon, n.d.)iagonal street grids are seen as the best solution for providing a balance between shading for streets and solar protection for building\", especially in the hot-arid summer season (Anon, n.d.). Augustine Rey, Justin Pidoux, and Charles Barde, in La science des plans de ville, calculated the best urban orientation according to the calorific power of the sun suggesting the concept of the \"heliothermic axis\", combining insolation and temperature (Anon, n.d.). The best fit for Paris was calculated for the south-east/north-west direction, with an azimuth of 19° (Anon, n.d.)). Rey's et al. ideas found major impact and resonance in Le Corbusier's thinking. Solar insolation was applied in La Ville radieuse (Anon, n.d.), an urban project designed by Le Corbusier as an ideal form of a utopic city, with orthogonal and diagonal axes with an angle of 45°, ordered by the rhythm of the solar day according to the heliothermic axis. Among the many objectors of the heliothermic axis, Gaston (Anon, n.d.) argued that the heliothermic factor is meaningless, since a temperature should me multiply by a mass and not by a duration (Anon, n.d.). The equalisation of insolation and the right to the sun was one of the major topics of the work by the Neapolitan architect Gaetano (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). He disagreed strongly with Rey's et al. heliothermic axis: Vinaccia's calculation was applied on the four sides of a building, not only on the two longest ones. His aim was to rationalise sun exposure, especially as thermal factor (Anon, n.d.). Since the wester sides take the advantage of a higher diffuse temperature when the sun reaches them, the optimal deviation will be from the north towards the east, in a clockwise rotation in a way to align to the direction of the rising summer solstice (Anon, n.d.)) (fig. 3). The characteristic of this planning is that the building façades are parallel to the direction of summer solstice sunrise and winter solstice sunset, and the others are orthogonal (Anon, n.d.). The main advantage is that the north façade, technically facing northwest, do receive sun every day a year, even at winter solstice, when the last ray of the sun penetrates the streets running parallel to the north façades ensuring a minimum insolation. Vinaccia's equisolar orientation was the only theory which took in consideration the solstices in urban planning. If this theory is applied to Pompeii, it can be noticed that not only the sun was seen rising parallel to the streets, but it also penetrated the urban grid, permeating and building the urban space. More than a calendric marker and sight target, it is possible to interpret the solstitial orientation of Pompeii through the lens of Vinaccia's equisolar orientation, hypothesising a rational idea of a city, where not only ritual but also functional aspects appear combined together in the choice of Pompeii secundum caelum no-cardinal orientation. Pompeii presents both secundum natura and secundum caelum orientations: the complex geomorphology of the plateau, with Via Stabiana following the contours of a natural canyon, results in a no-orthogonal layout with the east-west main axes reflecting the course of the sun at solstices. For the combination of these rationales, the urban morphology shows many orientations (fig. 1), also due to the diachronical expansion and contraction of the town. Even though it is plausible to think that the direction of the main urban routes was traced in the Archaic period, not all scholar agrees due to the little evidence on the Archaic urban form. Thus, when to date the solstitial orientation remains unclear. In this paper, a review of possible interpretations related to Pompeii secundum caelum orientation are investigated. The practical and theoretical aspects of sighting the sun with the groma was considered after the writing of the Roman agrimensores. Henrich Nissen's theory on the correspondence between a spatial orientation and the time of foundation according to the sun position was investigated in the light of recent critiques. For instance, the exact act which marked the dies natalis in Roman colonies is not known: possibly, the ritual perimeter of the plough might have been considered the factual foundation event. Le Gall's critiques to Nissen's theory embraced the possibility of inverse centuriation, which would bring to a statistical analysis unprovable for a single case study with little historical context. For this reason, several urban grids orientation data have been compared by scholars to put in light statistically significant orientation patterns. The conversion from the sun daily position to local calendars can be challenging as well: only solstices, equinoxes and cross-quarters days can be regarded as inherent astronomical directions, whereas other days of the year should be historically contextualised before being considered as foundation days. In Pompeii, the co-presence of the Doric Temple and the urban grid suggests a no-casual interest for the solstices. An interpretation where ritual is the prevailing rationale would bring to think that the town was founded on summer solstice, with the annual renewal of the foundation with the sun return in axis with the streets. In combination, this interpretation can be integrated to a discourse embracing a more functional idea of town. Indeed, solar irradiation has been one of the main factors in urban planning since antiquity. Many irradiation theories were proposed in the last centuries, developing different solutions for different latitudes. Among urbanists, the Neapolitan architect Gaetano Vinaccia suggested that a city oriented according to the position of the sun at solstices was the preferable layout for guaranteeing the most equilibrate irradiation across seasons. For a city with the equisolar layout as Pompeii, the coldest north façade of a building was always illuminated, allowing the penetration of the sun in the streets even in the shortest day of the year, winter solstice. With observation of the basic movements of the sun across the year, Vinaccia's general intuitions might have been applied in ancient Campania urbanism. Therefore, the results previously achieved by Nissen on Pompeii urban orientation may be also integrated with Vinaccia's equisolar orientation. A middle way point might be position to for such preliminary investigation, putting in evidence that a stratification of meanings is necessary for interpreting the role of the solstices at Pompeii. Comparing and integrating the ritual and the functional, Nissen's foundation day theory and Vinaccia's equisolar orientation, a further understanding of the role of the sun in urban planning in ancient Campania might be achieved. Fig. 3. Gaetano Vinaccia's equisolar orientation for urban planning. Adapted by Ilaria Cristofaro after Vinaccia, 1939a: 214. The urban grid and Doric temple azimuth values, if converted into declination coordinates, have indeed the same value. Due to the long historiography on the use of the terms cardo and decumanus in urban context, in this paper the same terminology is applied, although with the awareness of the inaccuracy of their usage. Ovidio, Fasti, IV, 815-30; Varrone, De lingua latina, V, 143-147; Servio, Ad Aeneidem, 5, 755. The calculation expressed in days from one solstice (summer or winter) would allow a transparent, not anachronistic data. Instead, the conversion of the day into local calendars would be already a form of interpretation.",

    "title": "Book Review of The Economy of Pompeii, edited by Miko Flohr and Andrew Wilson",
    "abstract": "This volume, the 12th in the series Oxford Studies on the Roman Economy, derives from a conference held in Oxford in 2012 and seeks to connect ongoing work in Pompeii to ongoing debates in Roman economic history with a view to reigniting the debate over whether individual cities can contribute to our understanding of the Roman economy (rejected by Jongman in the book's closing discussion). The book is divided into four broad sections that de ne its scope: \"City and Hinterland,\" \"Quality of Life,\" \"Economic Life and Its Contexts,\" and \"Money and Trade.\" In addition, there is closing discussion by Jongman and an introduction by the editors.",
    "full_text": "The introduction, in which the editors chart \"a century of scholarly debate\" (6-8) on the Pompeian economy, reveals many of the tensions in the book and some of its shortcomings. For them, the scholarship begins with Tenney Frank in 1918, who is followed by more recent scholars (including Jashemski, Curtis, Mayeske, and Moeller), through Maiuri in the Italian context, onward to the editors' triumvirate of Jongman, Wallace-Hadrill, and Laurence. There is a major omission here, though-Rostovtze , a key focus for Jongman's closing discussion. However, for the newcomer to the subject, the editors never actually de ne what the debate was about or how the debate stimulated further analysis and analytical eldwork in Pompeii. There is another omission from the introduction: how were excavations at Pompeii carried out to reveal (or not to reveal) evidence for economic history? In other words, was the economy a focus for excavators-not just Maiuri, but as far back as Spinazzola and Fiorelli and even into the present day? This omission is matched by another: how should we compare the Pompeian evidence (with its unique qualities and defects) with sites with quite di erent archaeological processes of deposition? As the editors conclude, \"It is only to be hoped that future work on the economic history of speci c cities will enable the scholarly community to compare the 'local' outcomes of these large historical processes in a more informed way\" (16). A key problem for the book is how the work by Pompeianists integrates with the preoccupations of scholars working on the economy. Rowan, drawing on her D.Phil. research (Oxford) on the bioarchaeological remains of the sewer from Cardo V in Herculaneum, provides plenty of data but does not really attempt to make comparisons to other sites. However, importantly, she sees a change in the diet of Pompeians with a greater variety of foodstu s consumed by 79 C.E. Lazer observes that the stature of Pompeians was similar to that found in other skeletal samples from Roman Italy, perhaps causing us to consider Pompeii as a possible proxy for other cities. Poehler's data-rich chapter argues that social activity has shaped the data that may be used to de ne the economy, but it is di cult, or even impossible, to distinguish the 10 shades of gray in his maps to be able to use his data and his ndings. The economic signi cance of one or more earthquakes in the 60s C.E. is raised by Monteix, who posits a need to view Pompeii as having \"a recuperation capacity\" and as a place to study \"urban resilience\" (212)factors that cause di culty integrating Pompeii into the norms and expectations for the Roman economy found, for example, in the editors' introduction or in Jongman's closing discussion. Esposito sees the e ects of the earthquakes in terms of the quality of frescoes produced and the need to produce a greater quantity of wall decoration following the earthquakes and, importantly, argues that painting should be seen as a form of urban production consumed by all classes across Pompeii. Pompeii is a site that, in recent years, has been subjected to ever more re ned mapping and quanti cation, as we see here in discussions of coins (Ellis, Hobbs), doorways (Poehler), dolia (Monteix), consumption in the House of Menander (Ray), and agricultural capacity (de Simone), and in Flohr's chapter entitled \"Quantifying With Flohr, we step into a world of Pompeian knowns and unknowns, the latter including the population, the part of the city above the ground oor that was sliced apart by volcanic processes, property divisions, the unexcavated part of the city, the suburbs just beyond the city walls, and more. Flohr's ingenious solutions create a high and low count for the population from the material remains of the city. Reading the graphs and statistics, I was struck by how we may equate the presence of the peristyle at the top end of the rank size as \"elite,\" but perhaps this may de ne the elite more broadly than the small demographic percentage assumed by most Roman historians. Thus, it may include the elite and those who were in a position to become part of the elite for a generation or more. Would renting a house with a peristyle allow you to gain a higher status? Equally, who exactly were part of this \"elite\"? Robinson links the interpretation of results from Insula VI.1 to the elite of the literary landscape of Cicero's De O ciis and other key texts, but to do so it is necessary to ignore the distance between practice and representation. The elite might include or exclude-among others -decurions, freed slaves, priestesses, or veterans. However, my own sense of the de nition of the elite found in the chapters of this book is that it corresponds to the sum of interactions between the few (however de ned) and the many, a process that produced the measurable inequalities that we can nd within the material remains at Pompeii. Thus, although Ellis later in the book may identify Insulae VIII.7 and I.1 as \"sub-elite\" (300) because of the absence of atria, it is possible or even probable that it was the elite who funded or created the urbanism of the subelite. Research on Pompeii has tended to complicate matters for the wider Roman economy, even in relationship to coins-the \"preferred monetary instrument of the Roman world\" (365). Ellis establishes the association between coin nds and construction, which we should view as a form of production, rather than associating coins with trade associated with shops. Importantly, he dates this building boom to the Augustan period, rather than after the earthquakes. Thus, these coins, representing 10% of total circulation for Verboven, are derived from contexts that are not related to trade per se, which is so often the focus of debates about coin circulation. Moreover, as both Ellis and Hobbs remind us, more than 20% of coin nds may be so corroded that they are illegible, which presents us with a quanti able absence of knowledge. Given the book's title, those interested in economic history will be drawn to it, and that may bring Pompeii into further dialogue with this interest group. The editors' view that Pompeii was prosperous will not be surprising to Pompeianists, because it depends on already-known facts combined with developments in archaeological science in relation to the aging of skeletons (discussed by Lazer). For Pompeianists, the book brings together high-quality work that adds to the publications associated with these scholars. I am not sure, though, that the book altered my view of the city's economy. While the papers are all of good quality, the volume does not entirely gel together and is very much ongoing, rather than shifting debates to a new position or reigniting debate. I suspect many papers will be read individually online, where the absence of color illustrations is an impediment to the reader, as it is in the print version at $150. There is a logic to publishing this book: assemble a cast of scholars whose work on Pompeii is already well known through publications, bring them to Oxford to discuss the topic over two days in 2012, and then have them write up their papers for a book published in 2017. This may be a function of the Oxford Roman Economy Project, with its aims rmly tied to a publication series, along with maintaining databases and a looser constellation of scholars working in the area. After publication, the book is purchased by university libraries and individuals and will appear in reading lists for undergraduate and postgraduate courses on Pompeii and the Roman economy-although its usefulness for undergraduate courses seems less certain. Overall, these are good papers and well worth reading for their individual content or as a collection of papers, but it will also be worth delving deeper into the more substantial publications and theses of these authors, and in the words of the editors, \"there are still many roads that can and need to be explored further\" (12).

    "title": "Reconstructing Pompeian Households",
    "abstract": "A database of objects discovered in houses in the Roman city of Pompeii provides a unique view of ordinary life in an ancient city. Experts have used this collection to study the structure of Roman households, exploring the distribution and variability of tasks in architectural spaces, but such approaches are necessarily affected by modern cultural assumptions. In this study we present a data-driven approach to household archeology, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem. This approach scales to large data sets and provides a more objective complement to human interpretation.",
    "full_text": "Over the past century the goal of archeology has shifted from finding objects of artistic value to reconstructing the details of day-to-day life in ancient cultures. Reconstructing daily life is difficult as the evidence that would be useful was generally considered commonplace and unworthy of preservation by people at the time. Objects are gradually moved or disposed of; structures are renovated, repurposed or recycled for building materials. These ongoing processes make it difficult to make statements about specific points in time based on material evidence. A remarkable exception to this pattern is the Roman city of Pompeii in southern Italy, which was was covered in volcanic ash during an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD. As a result of its sudden, violent destruction, many aspects of day-to-day life in first-century Roman Italy were preserved in place as they existed on a particular day. The study of Pompeian households has until recently been dominated by analyses of architectural patterns and wall paintings, as these are easily available for study. Only in the past few years has a database of objects, which are removed for conservation immediately upon excavation, been compiled and made available by (Anon, n.d.). This database, which is available online, 1 contains more than 6000 artifact records for finds in 30 architecturally similar \"atrium-style\" houses in Pompeii. For each artifact, the database specifies a type from 240 typological categories (coin, amphora, etc.) and a find location from 574 rooms. Allison has used data about artifacts in their original context to challenge many common assumptions about the function of particular types of object, the use of particular spaces, and the consistency of patterns of use across different houses. The relatively large amount of archeological information compiled in the Pompeian households database supports the application of statistical data mining tools. In this paper we apply one such tool, Bayesian mixed-membership modeling, in which rooms are modeled as having mixtures of functions, and functions are modeled as distributions over a \"vocabulary\" of object types. Mixed-membership models have previously been applied to a broad range of inference problems in applications such as population genetics (Pritchard et al., 2000), text mining (Blei et al., 2003) and social network analysis (Airoldi et al., 2008). We show that mixed-membership models both address several theoretical problems with simpler clustering methods and also provide improved predictive ability. Compared with a trained archaeologist, such models are naive and simplistic, but they have the advantage that they do not bring preconceived notions about culture along with them. As a demonstration, after assessing the model's predictive ability we consider several issues raised by Allison, and attempt to provide a perspective that is, if not unbiased, at least mathematically concrete in its biases. There are several previous examples of data-driven methods in the archaeological study of ancient households. Fiedler considers the relative proportions of fine, cooking, and plain ceramic ware found in three room types in the Greek city of Leukos (Anon, 2005). Ciolek-Torello applies PCA, factor analysis, and multidimensional scaling to objects found at Grasshopper Pueblo in Arizona (Ciolek-Torello, 1984), but finds the latent factors difficult to interpret. Cahill performs a k-means analysis of houses in the Greek city of Olynthus, using the percentage of floor space allocated to each room type as input variables (Anon, 2001). Cahill also identifies several problems faced in attempting to recover patterns of activity from house-hold assemblages (Anon, 2001): The database of houses at Olynthus contains more than 1000 distinct types, comparable to Pompeii's 240. This number of types cannot be easily studied and visualized. • Rooms can serve more than one function, and artifact types can be used for more than one purpose. A particular type of large shallow bowl is often associated with washing, but \"other examples of these artifacts, however, are found together with grinding assemblages and may have been used for kneading dough.\" Cahill continues \"just as the use of space in ancient houses was flexible and varied according to season or need, the use of artifacts could change, and our models for interpretation must be flexible enough to allow for such changeability.\" • Quantification of artifacts is critical. As an example, ancient looms used weights suspended by bundles of warp threads. These weights tend to survive after the organic matter of a loom has decayed. Cahill argues, however, that the presence of a single weight is not sufficient to indicate that a room was used for weaving, and that only the presence of a dozen or more weights in the same location indicates the presence of a loom. Both Cahill and Ciolek-Torello advocate using original data frequencies rather than binary presence/absence variables. Bayesian mixed membership models address all three issues. First, such models are appropriate for highdimensional categorical variables, having been applied to text documents, where vocabulary sizes are in the tens of thousands. Second, mixed membership models allow individual groups of observations to combine multiple \"components\" such as topics or activities, while simultaneously allowing any observed dimension, such as a word or artifact type, to be generated with non-zero probability by any component. Finally, using the multinomial event model rather than the binary event model allows us to take into account the number of times an artifact type occurs, rather than the simple fact that that type is present. For example, a single loom weight by itself might be absorbed into the functional group of other objects in the same room, while a group of 15 loom weights provides substantial evidence that a functional group with high probability of generating loom weights is active. The goal of this work is to use the evidence available to us from archaeological excavations to learn predictive models for the contents of different rooms in Roman houses. Such models should then help us better understand how the Romans used their domestic spaces. The information in the database compiled by Allison consists of a set of 30 houses, each consisting of between 7 and 56 rooms. Details on the houses are provided in Table 4. Each room is labeled with a type based on its architectural features. Room types are further divided between rooms surrounding the atrium, an open courtyard adjacent to the main street entrance (room 01 in Figure 1), rooms surrounding a garden area (room 09), and other rooms, including kitchens and bath complexes. Descriptions of room types and their frequencies are shown in Table 2. In each room, artifacts of different types were recorded. We now introduce mathematical notation for these entities. Let H be the set of houses {h 1 , ..., h 30 }. A room r in house h has type t ∈ {1, ..., 22}, and contains a set of objects. Objects are instances of a fixed dictionary of artifact classes A. Let the set of object class indicators x 1 , ..., x Nr be the objects in room r, such that x 3 = a if the third object is of class a. For readers familiar with text processing, this representation is similar to the standard bag-of-words model, with rooms analogous to documents, and objects analogous to words. Inspired by methods that have been applied to document analysis, we present four predictive models (names used in figures are shown in parentheses). 1. A single-distribution model (Simple), equivalent to a unigram language model. This model predicts artifact types based on the frequency of previously-seen artifacts, smoothed using a Dirichlet model (Zhai & Lafferty, 2001). Let N a be the number of instances of artifact type a in the training data and η be a smoothing parameter. The probability of a room r is 2. A conditional type-distribution model (CondSimple), a \"Naive Bayes\" model. This model is identical to the previous model, but takes into account room types. Let N a|t be the number of instances of artifact type a in rooms of type t in the training data. Conditioned on its type, the probability of a room r is 3. A mixed-membership \"topic model\" over functional groups (FG). As in text-oriented topic models (Blei et al., 2003), room contents are drawn from a mixture of k component distributions, which we describe here as \"functional groups\" (ie \"topics\" in document modeling). Examples are shown in Table 1. Given an allocation of objects in the training set to functional groups (either through hard or soft assignments), let N a|k be the number of instances of type a in group k. The probability of an object type a given a group k P (a|k, β) has the same form as Eq. 1 with N a|k substituted for N a and β for η. Let z 1 , ..., z Nr be indicator variables specifying an allocation of the objects x 1 , ..., x Nr in a new room r, such that z i = a if object x i is generated by group k, and N k|r = i I zi=k . Let α 1 , ..., α K be a vector of Dirichlet parameters. The probability of a room is then a marginalization over all possible settings of z: A mixed-membership model over functional groups conditioned on room type (CFG). This model is similar to the previous model, but with a distinct vector of Dirichlet parameters α are mixed-membership models that draw objects in a room from a room-specific mixture of distributions. The first and third models do not take into account room types, while the second and fourth use room types at training time and condition on room type at testing time. Inference in the first two models can be accomplished by counting. Inference in the mixed-membership models was carried out by Gibbs sampling using the Mallet toolkit (Anon, 2002). For the simple mixed-membership model (FG), asymmetric room-group hyperparameters α 1 , ..., α k and a single symmetric hyperparameter β were iteratively optimized as advocated by Wallach et al. (Wallach et al., 2009). Room-type-specific Dirichlet priors over functional groups were learned post-hoc from the simple mixed-membership model given saved Gibbs sampling states (Anon, 2000). We begin by evaluating these models using leaveone-out cross validation on houses. For thirty training runs, we estimated parameters for the four models. For the mixed-membership model, we trained 25 models, five random initializations each for K ∈ {10, 15, 20, 25, 30}. We ran each model for 10,000 iterations of Gibbs sampling, saving states every 500 iterations. Eq. 3 involves an intractable summation over an exponential number of possible functional group assignments. Held-out probability for rooms in the leftout houses was therefore estimated using Buntine's sequential method (Buntine, 2009). In order to make comparisons between rooms with differing numbers of objects, we report perplexity, the negative log probability of the room divided by the number of objects, as is typical in language modeling. The choice of the number of functional groups K affected perplexity, with more groups leading to greater likelihood. Average perplexities for different values of K are shown in Table 3. We did not consider K greater than 30 due to the relatively small size of the data set. All subsequent perplexity numbers are averaged over these five values of K. Overall, the conditional functional groups mixedmembership model provides the best predictive performance averaged over all rooms, followed by the functional groups model, the conditional type-distribution model, and the simple single-distribution model. The difference in means between each pair of models is significant according to a pairwise t-test. We found small p-values for all pairs except between the two non-mixed-membership models, which have p = 0.002. This performance of different models, however, varies between houses and between room types. Figure 2 shows the average perplexity of each house under the four models. In most cases the mixedmembership model conditioned on room type performs best, followed by the simple mixed-membership model. The conditional single-distribution model outperforms the simple \"unigram\" model in the majority of cases, 21 of 30 houses, but not always. House 4, the Casa dei Ceii, is the most unpredictable in all models. Allison reports that this house shows signs of having been disturbed after the eruption, possibly by people familiar with the floor plan of the house and the neighboring house. The most well-predicted house is number 25, House VIII 2,26, which has the fewest objects of any house (17). There is no clear relationship between average perplexity and number of objects, however: the largest collection (house 9, the Casa del Menandro), is in the middle range of perplexity scores. We can also look at the distribution of perplexities by room type. There are clear and consistent architectural patterns in Roman houses, but architectural similarity does not necessarily imply similarity of use. Evidence from Pompeii is commonly used to infer how Romans organized their household activities. It is therefore critical to evaluate how consistent the contents of rooms are between each other, in order to determine whether we can extrapolate from the sample of available rooms to more general conclusions about the specific function of rooms. Allison's classification of room types is shown in Table 2. Average perplexities over each room type are shown in Figure 3 (note that there is an additional type 0 for lower floors included in the online database but not the published description). The dark line shows the mean of the average perplexities for room types. In most cases, the two mixed-membership models outperform the non-mixed-membership baseline models, indicating that rooms are better described by a combination of more specific distributions learned from several different room types than room-specific distributions. The relative performance of the four models, however, varies between room types. Certain specialized rooms, such as entranceways (1), kitchens (14), latrines (15) and stairways (20) are better predicted by the two conditional models than their non-conditional counterparts. The type-distribution model is better than the functional group model for kitchens (p = 0.0002), but not significantly for front halls (3, p = 0.62). In many other cases, however, the conditional type-distribution model is either indistinguishable from or worse than the single-distribution model. If the average perplexity for a room type is greater for a non-conditional model than that model's conditional version, room type information is useful for prediction, implying that the contents of a particular room type are similar across houses. If perplexity is greater for the conditional model, individual instances of a room type do not predict the contents of similar rooms. The variability of perplexities are generally smaller for rooms centered around the front hall and the garden than \"other\" specialized rooms. For example, kitchens (14) and stairways (17) are better predicted conditioned on their types, indicating that these rooms have consistent contents. This argument is to Table 2). Main gardens (9) were difficult for all models to predict, indicating varied usage, while specialized rooms such as kitchens (14), latrines (15), and stairways (17) are distinctive and similar across houses. The dark line shows the mean average perplexity for each model. some extent circular, because these two room types are at least partly defined by the presence of large, immovable fixtures such as hearths and stairs, but it provides an indication of what the model should show if there is consistent use. In contrast, rooms open to the street ( 20) are less well predicted when conditioned on their type, indicating that conditional models are overfitting, and suggesting that we should be wary of generalizing about the contents of such rooms given our sample. The models presented in Section 3 provide a tool for testing archaeological questions. In this section we attempt to validate two hypotheses proposed by Allison. When artifacts are excavated, standard archeological practice involves removing them to secure storage for preservation. Although the location of artifacts is carefully noted in modern scientific digs, artifacts in storage tend to be analyzed in comparison to typologically similar objects rather than within their original context. As a result, questions about the use or function of particular artifact types have been based more on arbitrary tradition and researchers' perceptions of what an artifact is reminiscent of than the types of objects found with the object. For example, Allison identifies two classes of artifact, the casseruola (\"casserole dish\") and forma di pasticceria (\"pastry mold\"), that were named based on similarities to 19th century household objects. She cites research going back more than 100 years suggesting that these items were not used in food preparation contexts, but finds that contemporary scholars still make this assumption due to their (modern) names. Using imaginative 19th century names to understand the function of objects is not good practice, but simply counting cooccurrences within rooms may also lead to improper rejection of connections. Due to small sample sizes, it may be possible for two related items to never appear together in a room purely by chance. In order to reduce bias of both kinds, we explore the function of these artifact types using only cooccurrence data, without any reference to the actual typology of the objects. We use the functional group mixedmembership model to detect clusters of object cooccurrence that may indicate functions. Note that we are still dependent on experts to classify physical objects into appropriate categories, but given those classifications we make no further archeological assumptions in training the model. At the same time, we expect that if two artifact types a 1 and a 2 appear with artifacts a 3 , a 4 and a 5 , all five objects will tend to be placed in the same functional group, even if a 1 and a 2 never occur together. Intuitively, if two objects share a similar pattern of use, they should both have high probability in one or more \"topic\". Given a model, we can evaluate the probability that two artifact types a 1 and a 2 will be produced by the same functional group, marginalized over functions, as P (a 1 , a 2 ) = k P (k)P (a 1 | k)P (a 2 | k), where P (k) is proportional to the average number of tokens assigned to functional group k and P (a 1 | k) is proportional to the average number of objects of type a 1 assigned to functional group k. Table 6 shows results for the two types mentioned previously. There is little to no connection to food preparation objects, supporting Allison's claim that modern names for these items are incorrect. 6 Modeling room functions The Roman houses included in the database show strong architectural patterns. Much of the study of Pompeian households has involved identifying categories of rooms and assigning functions to them. Again, Allison argues that commonly held assumptions about such functions are incorrect. For example, the atrium is often described as a formal space, in which the pater familias received his clients and distributed gifts from a large metal chest. Allison argues that the atrium was more of a utilitarian, industrial space. Similarly, a closed room off the atrium is described as a cubiculum (\"bedroom\"), but there is little evidence that these rooms correspond to modern concepts of bedrooms. Before using an analysis of objects to provide information about the function of spaces, it is important to establish whether architectural room types have consistent patterns of object contents. The city suffered a severe earthquake 17 years before the final eruption, and was disrupted before and after the eruption. As shown previously, certain types of rooms have strong connections to particular artifact classes, while for others, conditioning on room type does not improve predictive performance. As a result of this variability of room contents, it is difficult to make general claims about what activities occurred in which spaces. We can, however, attempt to rule out certain possibilities. Table 7 shows probable functional groups for several architectural types. Atria show evidence of utilitarian storage: large ceramic amphorae. The only type that shows significant evidence of objects related to bedding is type 11 (large open rooms with views of the garden); the cubiculum does not. The excavations at Pompeii provide a unique view into domestic life in 1st century Roman Italy. We analyzed a database of 30 Roman houses using four predictive models, comprising all combinations of singledistribution and mixed-membership models, and unconditional models and models that condition on Allison's room type annotations. Building statistical models of the distribution of objects in these houses is valuable in that it provides a data-driven method for measuring how confident we can be in making claims about the function of domestic spaces. In many cases, conditioning on room type did not improve predictive performance, demonstrating that room function is not necessarily determined by architectural characteristics. Our results are consistent with Allison's challenge to assumptions that small closed rooms (cubicula) were used for sleeping and that two object types (casseruola and forma di pasticceria) were used in food preparation. We find that mixed-membership models provide a promising method for identifying patterns of use in archaeological data. They find interpretable functional groups, have good predictive performance, and address theoretical problems with simpler clustering methods. As the quantity of digitized data from excavations increases, such methods should provide a powerful tool for interpreting archaeological data.",

    "full_text": "This thesis is concerned with two books of narrative history, The World That Never Was: A True Story of Dreamers, Schemers, Anarchists and Secret Agents and Pompeii: The Living City, both written by me during the 2000s, the latter co-authored with Ray Laurence. Pompeii (2005) explores life in the Colonia Veneria Pompeiana, a provincial Italian city, in the middle of the first century CE, during the period prior to the eruption of Vesuvius in 69 CE. The World That Never Was (2009) offers an account of the Anarchist movement and its complex relationship with the police and intelligence services across an international diaspora during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, beginning with the Paris Commune of 1871. Both books are deeply researched works of historical synthesis that draw on my extensive study of secondary sources, alongside significant original research, to propose new interpretations of their respective subjects. Research in archives across Europe and America for The World That Never Was revealed unrecognized patterns of political association and police provocation, for example; in Pompeii, a reconsideration of neglected archaeological records in the context of new excavations suggested novel insights into social mobility in the first century CE. However, I shall consider the original intellectual contribution made by the books only quite briefly. The approach I have adopted in this critical consideration of the books rests rather on my assertion that they offer an equal contribution to knowledge through their innovative approach to the process of constructing historical narratives. The subjects of the two books are ostensibly very different, divided by eighteen hundred years and by a conceptual boundary between the ancient and modern world. Yet as works of narrative history they share much in common, not least in their interest in networks: social and political in one case, ideological and conspiratorial in the other. Both also had to address the particular challenges of working with highly fragmentary sources at the limits of the historical record. Furthermore, the selection of subjects and their treatment in the books reflect my work with interactive digital media, which preceded and directly informed the writing of the books and has continued since their publication. My aim in this thesis is to propose a theoretical framework for my practice as an author of historical narrative across digital and analogue forms, and certain principles that may guide future work in this field. To this end, I have chosen to focus primarily on the broad context in which the books were conceived, the process of synthesis and narrative construction involved, and the techniques that I used to realise my particular aims. The change in the roles of author and reader suggested by interactive forms, and how this may be accommodated in an analogue text, is of particular interest. The co-supervision of the thesis by representatives from Creative Writing and History departments reflects both the nature of the books and my application of theoretical approaches from literary study to the role of narrative in the making of history. The thesis falls into three parts. In the first chapter I consider the background to my choice of subjects, and the challenges that these subjects presented. In the second, I propose a theoretical contextualisation of the work, through a speculative exploration of the possibilities of digital narrative historiography. In the third I reflect on certain of the key principles and techniques that I applied in the books, and assess their effectiveness in relation to the critical reception. Reference is made throughout to Bakhtin's theory of the chronotope, to the theory of 'Possible Worlds', and to the genre of 'historiographical metafiction' with which I had engaged in preceding work. (Anon, n.d.) Readers unfamiliar with these concepts may wish to first read the Appendix, where key aspects of that work are surveyed. Indeed, the Appendix, excluded to meet restrictions on thesis length, is where I would initially direct all readers. I first began to explore possible subjects for a work of narrative history while actively involved with digital research into interactive narrative in the late 1990s. However, it was in the early 2000s that I conceived and started to research and plan The World That Never Was and Pompeii. My immediate motivation to write the books arose from intellectual curiosity and artistic ambition, although by this time I also wanted to return to an analogue medium in order to secure greater control over the production of the texts in which I was invested. I had relished the creative collaboration with technical colleagues in experimental digital work but my dependence on them had stymied my sense of expressive satisfaction. My interest in the genre of historiographical metafiction, explored in my early novel writing (see Appendix, p.59), had by this point segued into an interest in narrative history. (Anon, n.d.) Work that engaged with questions of fictionality and evidential uncertainty, and which allowed an emotional and intellectual engagement with the subjective experience of the past, remained of particular fascination. In this, I was inspired by the microhistorical work of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Natalie Zemon Davis, Robert Darnton and Carlo Ginzburg. (Anon, 1979) Roger Chartier has observed of Ginzburg's The Cheese and the Worms how 'it is on this reduced scale, and probably only on this scale, that we can understand, without deterministic reduction, the relationship between systems of belief, of values and representations on one side, and social affiliations on the other'. (Anon, n.d.) The attraction of recovering the experience of the past through the study of marginal individuals resonated with me. Furthermore, the theoretical framework offered by microhistorians to explain their work also addressed questions of authority and narrative construction that recollected my concerns in my digital work. It was the experience of developing and producing drama-documentaries, in parallel with the digital projects, that most immediately influenced the choice of subject for Pompeii, the first of my books to be published. An 'Inhabited Television' research project, on which I worked as virtual world dramaturge, had involved Channel 4 as the broadcast partner. (Anon, n.d.) One proposal for the final deliverable was a participatory history series, on the model of the recent The 1900 House, which would be filmed in a virtualworld model of Pompeii. As with much of the research I was involved in at the time, its ambitions were some years in advance of the technology. (Anon, n.d.) The commissioning editors at Channel 4 recognised this, but instead wanted a Pompeii programme that took advantage of the new affordability of Computer Generated Imagery. (Anon, n.d.) The result was an 80-minute drama-documentary called The Private Lives of Pompeii, which I researched, wrote and associate-produced. (Anon, n.d.) The programme was an account of the social history of the city, which interspersed expert interviews with scenes that dramatised the interwoven stories of fictional characters who represented a cross-section of that society. It was unconventional both in its overt fictionalisation, and in its use of two voiceover narrators. One of these narrators was the familiar authoritative guide, the other a fictionalised and unreliable diagetic voice from the past, which was, at the end of the documentary, revealed as belonging to a survivor of the Vesuvian eruption. While researching the television film, I became aware of the extraordinary wealth of recent academic research that had not yet been synthesised into a form accessible to a wide readership. Compared to the worlds of Montaillou, Menocchio and Martin Guerre, explored in the work of Le Roy Ladurie, Ginzburg and Davis, the first-century town of Pompeii offers a similar if not greater abundance of evidence concerning its society and its inhabitants. (Anon, n.d.) However, the evidence is highly fragmentary and atomised. It is also primarily material rather than textual, and where it is textual it is unverifiable by comparison with other texts of sufficient detail. In all cases it demands to be interpreted in relation to its complex physical context. In so far as Microhistory seeks to set typical events and characters against a carefully described social background, such an approach to ancient Pompeii faced challenges far greater than the seminal works of the genre, which deal with the medieval or early modern periods. Even Davis's Return of Martin Guerre is embroidered around two independent and near contemporary records of the historical events: Coras's Arrest Memorable and Le Sueur's Historia. Moreover, in Davis's aim of recreating 'the hidden world of peasant sentiment and aspiration', she uses the Coras as a point of departure for research that draws on sources including notarial contracts and registers of Parlementary sentences, both of which afford her exemplary insights into the habits and mentalité of members of the local society. Although the only literary sources of the period for peasant life are from the comic theatre, which Davis regrets 'is limited in its psychological register and in the range of situations in which villagers are placed', these comedies nevertheless yield insights when considered alongside and against other records. Davis's work, however, is rendered contentious for academic historians, and more accessible for other readers, by her decision that where she cannot find her 'individual man or woman' in the archives, the account offered would be 'part my invention, but held tightly in check by the voices of the past'. (Anon, n.d.) I had recruited Ray Laurence as historical consultant for the television documentary. In the course of our work together, he and I began to discuss collaboration on a book that would be of far greater scope than the programme. It was apparent, however, that the most significant challenges in writing such a book lay not only in the breadth of evidential detail that would need to be organised into narrative form, but in how we would animate the stories of individuals from the fragmentary remains of Pompeii. We came to the view that the checks on invention might have to be looser, the contract with the reader rather different, and that relationship handled with unusual sensitivity. Although the unique preservation of Pompeii was due to a single cataclysmic event, the notion that the site represents a moment fixed in time is illusory and misleading. There is certainly a rich 'archaeology of catastrophe': skeletons of citizens caught fleeing with their belongings, trapped in the voids left in the compacted lapilli by their decayed corpses into which resin or plaster can be cast; or the carbonised loaves in the baker's oven. (Anon, n.d.) However, the seemingly pristine site that was exposed on its original excavation has been lost through careless preservation. Moreover, documentation from the excavations is now widely dispersed, making the provenance of much of the material evidence uncertain. The hand-written daybooks containing the excavation records, or even the vast record of three thousand inscriptions from the walls of the city, require a process of forensic textual excavation and interpretation to reveal their significance. To my mind, it is the longitudinal insights that are most revealing of Pompeian society. (Anon, n.d.) Of particular interest to me, in these terms, were the social and political networks of family, trade and patronage, and how they interwove across time. James Franklin's then newly published work Pompeis Difficile Est, which attentively reconstructed candidatures in Pompeian elections, would provide essential groundwork. (Anon, n.d.) Yet only a few accurately datable events unique to the city are known, in relation to which any speculative chronology of others must be tentatively organised. Determining even a basic sequence within which events and durations of activity within the social and political networks could be organised was hugely complex. An early idea mooted by Ray was to organise the account as a typical 'Year in Pompeii', which was attractive in its simplicity but risked excluding too much fascinating information. The narrative would need to be framed within a longer time period and address the multiple temporalities of the city. An equal challenge related to space and scale, not least because it was in space-time that networks existed in embodied form, and in space that their constitutive events left legible evidence. The location of a graffito in which a lowly client asserted their support for a named elite political candidate was far more meaningful if understood in relation to the position in the city of houses or businesses with which each could be associated, even more so in relation to the house of the candidate's father who had manumitted the client from slavery a decade earlier. At times the textual and the material evidence coincided in space: an amphora bearing a merchant's stamp found near a wall painting by the same hand as one in another building. At others, the telling information was material alone: the degree of damage suffered by a family's house in the earthquake; the quality of the brickwork repair that indicated poverty, or haste, or delay; alterations in the water supply infrastructure that suggested shifting social status. (Anon, n.d.) One literary account of life in the area has survived, Petronius's Satyricon, but its satirical register and quite possibly propagandist intent, lacking any comparison to anchor it, make it as unreliable as the classical histories of Cassius Dio, Suetonius and Tacitus, written with political agendas whose nuance is lost. And yet, to the informed ear, everywhere in the ruined city voices break through from the past -out of the fine grain of evidence found in the graffiti, and the crumbling walls of the houses themselvesamounting to a clamour. Since the written evidence is often informal in character, and decay does not differentiate by social standing, whispers of the 'voices from below' can be discerned too: women and slaves. It was only through intricate speculative reconstruction of relationships between time, place, person and event that I could begin to imaginatively repopulate the huge and detailed map of the Pompeii excavations, extracting impressions of the individual from the prosopographical record. (Anon, n.d.) Over the course of two years' research, my mental map overlays became ever denser with information about lives that might be animated, but also about the constraints imposed on this process by the evidence. Each instance of an event on this populated map bore, in my mind and in my notes, the data relating to its provenance and metadata regarding its reliability; every concatenation of data was similarly accorded a place on the spectrum of speculation, from near certainty to fictionality. Research by Andrew Wallace-Hadrill into the domestic spaces of Pompeii and Herculaneum as encodings of social practice and power had been revelatory to me during the research for the documentary. (Anon, n.d.) As a contribution to microhistorical study it seemed to offer new ways to recover the qualia of ancient lives which might at least give better grounds for speculation concerning the emotional, sentimental, psychological, even cognitive worlds of the past -the 'possible worlds' of its inhabitants (see Appendix p.66). It is hard not to feel for the clients crowded in a small anteroom waiting to be summoned into the presence of a patron who commands the lofty spaces of an atrium, framed within the square of the tablinum and with his private garden behind, or for the slave emerging at speed from concealed passages and turning corners where the masonry was rounded to enable inconspicuous flow. But approached out of my preceding work with the dynamic shaping of storyworld spaces in a virtual world, Wallace-Hadrill's discussion of social space as scenographic, a stage for the performance of power relations even at a domestic level, also afforded insights into new principles by which a narrative experience of history might be constructed. Another area that would be a challenge when writing a 'life of Pompeii' involved managing the variability of scale in the book's narrative of space-time. Pompeii was a small town in provincial Italy on the periphery of the vacation resorts in the Bay of Naples frequented by rich Romans. The Roman world of the first century CE, however, was both centralised and integrated, with trade flowing in and out of Pompeii from its immediate environs, its regional neighbours, from Rome but also from the great littoral cities of the Mediterranean and, beyond them, along trade routes into Africa and Asia. A marginal provincial city was not isolated from events at the national and imperial level. A narrative history of such a place must relate the micro to the macro, yet in the case of Pompeii those connections are tenuous, the density of data found locally being hugely disproportionate to that from the rest of the Empire. To speculate at such a large scale carries inherent risks of overstatement, and the relationship of narrative and evidence must be especially carefully managed. Although Pompeii was the first of the two books that I wrote and published, having been commissioned in 2002 to capitalise both on interest raised by the television programme and the working relationship that Ray Laurence and I had established, I was at the time already researching and planning The World That Never Was. I had earlier explored ideas for possible books about the radical tradition in England, the history of utopianism, and Belle Époque Paris, but had not found a narrative approach to any of these that seemed sufficiently interesting. Similarly, I had probed but dismissed the possibility of a book about the individual experience of the national anxieties manifest in late nineteenthcentury British fiction around foreign infiltration and invasion plans, suggested by memories of an essay by Norman Sherry on the origins of Conrad's The Secret Agent. (Anon, n.d.) These ideas coalesced, quite suddenly, in the autumn of 2001, in response to two very different external stimuli: my reading of an advance copy of Jenny Uglow's The Lunar Men and the attack on the World Trade Centre. (Anon, n.d.) Coincidentally, earlier that year I had begun to research the recent history of international terrorism, notably the work of Walter Laquer and papers by Richard Bach Jensen, for another possible project. (Anon, n.d.) The events of September 2001 suggested a possible reframing of the early history of anarchism that considered the terroristic violence promulgated by some of its proponents in relation to the ideology's utopian aims. The intention would be to understand the human factors that determined how anarchism had come to be perceived by posterity, distinguishing the historical movement from the reputation it acquired. Uglow's book, which I found thrilling for its exploration of the history of ideas and of technology through a group biography of collaborators, celebrated a Society of influential scientists and inventors centred on the English Midlands. 'Together they nudge their whole society over the threshold of the modern,' Uglow had written of their appeal, 'tilting it irrevocably away from old patterns of life towards the world we know today.' (Anon, n.d.) I would take a larger canvas than Uglow but would survey a panorama of epic failure, in which the new world never dawned. The structure I conceived for The World That Never Was would support a characterbased, narrative account of an international radical movement as its members converged in particular configurations and dispersed. It would be a group biography that ebbed and flowed, in which certain periods in certain places might allow something approximating microhistorical study. I envisaged a study of subversion and surveillance, of interwoven networks of revolutionary activism and its policing, that would attempt to unpick the tapestry of fictionalisation that had been cast over the events of the period. In so doing, it would seek to reveal a history of the anarchist movement. It would relate the microcosm of interpersonal relationships in particular episodes of its development; the sparser mesonetworks that spanned larger spatial, temporal and sociometric divides, and whose effects could be discerned at the aggregated level of group action; and the macrocosmic perspective on the influence and perception of the movement on wider society. Part group biography and part microhistory, implicating cultural history and the study of the imaginary, it would allow me to fulfill my ambitions as a writer of narrative history in a particular mode. As with Pompeii, the most immediate challenges concerned scope and scale. By the end of the nineteenth century, the anarchist movement was a global phenomenon which, whilst unevenly distributed, was also sustained through exile and dispersal in the face of persecution. It had ideological roots that some have traced back to the Anabaptists of the sixteenth century, and it fizzled throughout the twentieth century without decisive moments of rupture or a clear point of resolution. Associated challenges included what framework and principles I should apply in constructing the narrative, again without the guidance of any conventionally recognised through-line of, for example, an individual life, or any meta-narrative other than one that simplistically demonised or celebrated the anarchist movement. Which were the nodes in the network -people, places, occurrences -in relation to which the myriad possible strands of activity might be filtered, and around which they might be most revealingly organised? I planned TWTNW, as I had Pompeii, in extreme detail. The process of researching and shaping the book, up to the moment when writing began, involved constant iteration between the multiple elements that had to be accommodated in the construction of its narrative: durations of time, locations, characters, occurrences, and ideas. First the timespan was determined, approximating the adulthood of the generation of anarchist thinkers and activists who were the heirs of Bakunin (whose international profile and influence made him a conspicuous point of departure). Next, the main protagonists began to emerge from a network model of the relationships between the human actors: strong connectors, weak connectors, bridges, and significant but surprising outliers. Henri Rochefort, for example, though anomalous in any conventional account of anarchism, recurred across the period as a weak bridge between intriguingly diverse figures. Moving outwards from these to associated nodes suggested possible secondary figures for exploration, who were of particular interest when, as in the case of agent provocateurs, they intersected otherwise distinct networks. Then space and time filters were applied, to reveal physical proximity of significant individuals, whether in a city where a terrorist attack took place, or at a conference that lasted a period of days, or during an exile of years or decades. With dispersal, and in an age of rapid technological advances and infrastructural developments, the vectors of communication inevitably became of greater significance, so they too had to be mapped for how they could collapse time and space, whether by means of a sled ride, or an electric telegram, or a 'go-back' day-return ticket from England to Belgium. Wherever and whenever meaningful activity was identified in the network, the environment in which it occurred was explored in more detail. Sometimes this prompted a revised understanding that then flowed backwards, causing adjustments as it ramified through the model. Occasionally it threw up events or characters, such as the hoaxer Jogand-Pagès, also known as Léo Taxil, whose co-location with and thematic relevance suggested their strategic inclusion. (Anon, n.d.) During the five years of research, however, the multi-dimensional network model remained, taxingly, a mental one. Today, tools for visualising network analysis, similar to specialised software such as Palentir that is used for tracking criminal networks, might alleviate that particular burden. (Anon, n.d.) Beyond the challenges involved in structuring the work, however, it was apparent from early in the research process that the challenges of engaging with the historical evidence in narrative form required a treatment that would invoke questions of interpretive authority and reader agency. The world of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and of its great cities, London and Paris above all, is abundantly documented. As with Pompeii, however, the evidence required for a detailed understanding of the specific, often self-contained anarchist subculture, and that of the police services with which it became enmeshed, was unexpectedly fragmentary and dispersed, and difficult or impossible to access and verify. In many cases, the evidential problems testified to a different kind of marginality and historical muting than that of slaves whose lives were deemed unworthy of record. Rather it was those who actively sought to remain invisible or elusive through concealment and pseudonyms, or whose transgressions of social norms encouraged their misrepresentation, or else whose activities were suppressed in the historical record or erased from it by those in positions of power with interests to protect. This elusiveness applied equally to the police and spies of different nations as to the revolutionaries, often more so. The unreliability of the data, even when it was profuse and accessible, is epitomised by the reports dispatched back to Paris from the French anarchist emigré communities in London in the 1890s which are now held in the archives of the Préfecture de Police in Paris. (Anon, 1994) Where a particular police service had an interest in an anarchist cell, it would attempt to place or recruit at least two spies, so that each might corroborate or inform on the other. The archival cartons in the Préfecture are crammed with crumbling telegrams, but so different are the double accounts of any meeting that they are difficult even to reconcile, let alone decipher for anything approaching a reliable version. Informants constantly vied for position and preferment, exaggerating, inventing, passing on rumour as fact, second-guessing, acting as provocateurs and quite probably sharing false intelligence under the guidance of paymasters from other national services. The British and Russian often had informants in the same groups as the French police, perhaps sometimes the same person. (Anon, n.d.) Contemporary published accounts of anarchism, its milieu and policing are wildly unreliable too, by dint of their intended purpose, which was often propagandist. Anarchism is a utopian creed that believes the perfectibility of human nature to be thwarted only by the oppressive social institutions in which power has been accumulated, and that heaven on earth will arrive with their overthrow. As such, it appeals to those inclined to dramatic Romanticism, who can imagine the impossible and are prepared to demand it. Their memoirs offer self-dramatising accounts of their own lives, and highly partial accounts of others. The prism of possible worlds -past, present and futurethrough which they perceive the actual world is at extreme variance to more conventional apprehensions of it, however enticing may be the dream of hope that is promised. Conversely, the conspiratorial versions of reality purveyed by their antagonists in the police and intelligence services similarly aim to conjure the possibility of terrible hidden presents and fantastical futures, while speaking to the fears of the public rather than its hopes. With little or no objective reportage of anarchism at the time, the terrain for historical research is dangerously slippery. Despite warning signs in my extensive reading of secondary sources, I had supposed that deep archival research would provide some stable grounding for the microhistorical study. However, this was rarely the case. Files, whose contents senior archivists in Moscow had suggested would provide key insights, were delivered, insouciantly, empty; the high tide of glasnost was receding. In Brussels, documents that I had laboriously tracked down for the crucial links they promised had long ago been replaced by slips indicating the destruction of the original 'By Order of the Cabinet'. A four-year-long Freedom of Information battle over relevant Special Branch ledgers gained me access, finally, to several hundred pages in which every name and detail that was considered sensitive, amounting to probably nine words in every ten, had been redacted. The protection of informants' names in perpetuity was the justification given by the Special Branch and, avoiding conspiratorial conclusions, specific national security concerns may be adduced to explain other limitations on access too. The overall impression, however, was that the history that I was excavating had been buried in lime by state authorities, in the past but also the present, who were determined that the truth about certain activities should be unrecoverable. (Anon, n.d.) To attempt to reconstruct that history in narrative form, as I intended, would require a strategy towards the unreliable nature of the evidence, and the identifiable lacunae in it, that was more sophisticated than that required in reconstructing Pompeian society, since it was apparently more accessible. Once again, therefore, questions of textual authority and reader agency were of practical as well as theoretical concern. A fine-grain narrative history of anarchism and its policing which took the reader into the sensibility of the time would inevitably entail authorial speculation and surmise, to the point where the book became, in part, a history of the imaginary. Finding a way for the text to signal its own unreliability, inviting sceptical agency on the part of the reader, would therefore be essential. This invitation to scepticism seemed an appropriate response to the overabundance of certainty characterising the new 'War on Terror' that provided the background to the writing of the book. A book about anarchism would prompt its readers, when confronted with incompatible narratives or dissonant registers, to interrogate their own judgment and conscience. And if the past did not illuminate the present, then perhaps a contemporary consciousness could cast light in the other direction. This was Le Roy Ladurie's hope in 1979, on publishing Carnival, his microhistory of the massacre in Romans during the Dauphine revolt. At that time it had been the Iranian Revolution that he thought might inform readings of Carnival, towards a better understanding of 'how four centuries ago, in the France of 1580, reactionary Catholicism and the revolutionary spirit formed their odd couple'. (Anon, n.d.) I regarded both books, from the beginning, as affording an opportunity for me to gain insight, at scale, into the authorial processes involved in constructing narrative history: insight of the kind needed for the design of digital systems to mediate historical narrative construction. As I have said, the choice of their subject matter, and the approach I took in planning their narratives, was informed both intentionally and inadvertently by my prior work in interactive narrative, most particularly by my design of a story engine for a project called Gnosis (see Appendix p.63). As discussed, the idea for Pompeii derived indirectly from plans for an unrealised digital project. In the case of The World That Never Was, I hoped the book might become the centrepiece of a collaborative online experiment that would allow readers to construct narratives through the data space that it surveyed. This too is yet to be realised. At no point did I envisage either book as an immersive, emergent, systemically managed narrative experience of the sort that Gnosis might have produced. Although the books may hint at speculative design possibilities, they reflect my preceding digital work more through the sense of the malleability of narrative data, and the potential of user agency, that I had assimilated to my authorial practice, along with my awareness of the risks and responsibilities these entail. It is clear to me in retrospect, however, that while wrestling with the challenges and responsibilities of writing narrative history at the margins of evidential reliability, I also employed some of the principles of narrative construction that I had conceived for a digital form. Today, when digital methods of historical enquiry are approaching a point where the digital representation of the products of such enquiry becomes of greater concern, reflection on these principles may be illuminating. In the following chapter I therefore essay a theoretical context for my work on the books in relation to the potential I see in interactive digital media for new forms of historiography, and the poetics that might support it. The ideal objective of historical study is to recover the truth about the past, though the best we can perhaps hope to achieve, as Peter Laslett suggests, is 'understanding ourselves in time'. (Anon, n.d.) Historical truth is elusive and perhaps even illusory, at least as something that can be reliably known. A fact may be apprehended by an immediate percipient, insofar as sense impressions and their cognitive interpretation are epistemologically trustworthy. For a fact to constitute an historical fact, however, it must at least have made a recorded impression. A tool striking wood creates a dent; a balance of account shows a payment made. Insofar as we understand the logic of the world in question, on the basis of each recorded fact, deductions may be made. Where other facts too are available that may be related to them, those deductions may be elaborated. Comparison between facts is possible, terms of association may be proposed, patterns identified. Every step in this process, however, is an act of semiological interpretation that is fallible, and with each step the potential for error accumulates in likelihood and scope. Early in this process, raw data is synthesised into the deduction of an event. Historical events may be envisioned as virtual enactments that emulate the operations of personal memory. However, convention and experience prime and govern the images summoned, rendering arbitrary the relationship between signifier and signified. The images that come to my mind, at this moment, are of a hammer falling in slow motion, cracking a lacquered tabletop; of loose change in a metal saucer. The first approximates cinematic montage (whilst montage theory itself consciously emulated the operation of perception); both supply detail, with assumed contexts ready to rush in and embellish. (Anon, 1979) Additional factual information would cause those mental constructions of the events to be revisited and refined. However, latent bias is impossible to eradicate. So too is the instinct to make events intelligible through narrative. An historical fact or event must be communicated. Once it is represented, it immediately forms a semantic construction -a drawing, a verbal phrase, an RDF triple (the base structure of semantic data) -which employs specific vocabulary and grammar towards the objective of being most accurately understood. The axe fell (on the block). The bill was settled (by the merchant). Already the expressions are inflected and pressing towards elaboration. Just a few steps further, with a few more prepositions to introduce sequence and causality, and the historical fact will be caught up in a narrative. The axe fell on the block and the king's head tumbled. The merchant settled the bill in return for the goods. Such simple historical narratives demand explanation and expansion, forward and backwards in time; to be situated in a wider flow of events and context. The nature and likely frequency of the core events imply methods by which that context might be recovered, as well as the nature of additional facts that may most usefully be constellated to that end. Were it a peasant chopping wood who wielded the axe, then the depth and number of the notches in the block might afford the only available facts to be adduced, as François Furet would suggest. (Anon, n.d.) A craftsman would use a finer tool and leave finer marks. Facts are facts, historical or otherwise. By definition, they did happen and, indeed, happened in a certain sequence involving cause and effect, in time and space, to which a narrative is implicit. However, a single fact does not belong to only one sequence and narrative, but exists in a network of relationships of a complexity that is beyond feasible recording, recovery or representation. Every historical narrative is a conjectural version of the past, a hypothesis built out of other hypotheses, each of which represent a trace through a vast, dimly lit database of potential knowledge. It is an attempt to express historical truth that rests on what its author, at a particular moment and for a particular purpose, considers significant. Making the selection and the trace is a creative process that entails personal judgments that balance multiple considerations, made in the context of existing knowledge and expertise. Cumulatively, these traces may describe larger phenomena such as historical processes. These in turn may be located within totalising meta-narratives that emphasise certain of their features. Viewed only from the perspective of the temporal organisation of that sequence, as Claude Levi-Strauss observed, 'there are as many chronologies as there are culture-specific ways of representing the passage of time'. (Anon, n.d.) A linear story of diachronic process, for example, already imposes conventions. An account in which human agency dominates prioritises an anthropocentrism to the neglect of impersonal forces. One that favours environmental factors, such as Ferdinand Braudel's longue durée, may spurn narrative as an inappropriate mode but will veer back towards it when human agency enters its purview. (Anon, n.d.) These impositions of cultural-historical constructions are expressed as narrative emplotment: the story that is told about causes and their effects. The degree to which any individual reader accepts an historical narrative is finally a matter of trust in that selection and organisation of the facts. This trust depends on many factors, some of which may be intentionally encoded in the text while others are extrinsically encoded. The former could range from explicit authorial analysis of the facts and their verifiability, to the coherence of the narrative offered. An example of the latter might be the social and professional status of the author, which may be seen to carry validation by a more or less identifiable collective, in which the status and expertise of its individual members is implicated. Trust may also be established through conventions that span the intrinsic and extrinsic, such as adherence to certain principles of interpretation that have recognised currency, from accepted scholarly method to ideological affiliation. Meta-narratives imply the discoverability in the past of the processes of which they are a prior configuration, which may lend credibility to accounts that share their structure, to the extent that they themselves are believed. (Anon, n.d.) The terms in which an historical narrative invites that trust may be variously signalled within and beyond the text. Its narrative can position itself through the use of recognisable signifiers of genre. The citation of extrinsic authority in the analysis of factual verifiability, for example, would indicate the genre of 'scholarly authority'. Other texts might use distinct configurations of space and time, comprising 'chronotopes' of the kind that Bakhtinian theory proposes as the defining feature of genre. (Anon, n.d.) For example, transitions in space and time might be arranged to present an historical narrative in which suspense is deployed as a narrative strategy of factual discovery. 'A sequence of events can be narrated as a tragedy or as satire (farce) or romance (etc.),' Hayden White argued, 'and there is no way of proving that one of these is the right way of narrating it.' (Anon, n.d.) Genre and other kinds of affiliation may be signified by paratextual elements too, as Gérard Genette has described. (Anon, n.d.) A title and cover design are examples inherent to the book in codex form, though others, such as illustrations and critical apparatus, are common. Different readers will decode the complex interplay of signifying elements in and around an historical narrative variously, bringing their own biases, preconceptions and expectations to the task. For most, the foremost proof of a narrative's validity as a vehicle of historical truth will be its perceived accuracy, meaning its adherence to verifiable fact. Many, however, will recognise that factual truth is not absolute, since not always achievable, and that the limitations it imposes are therefore actually detrimental to most historical narratives. These already often embrace an epistemology in which, to some degree, a subjective conception of truth is also valid and useful. In writing narrative history, verifiable factual accuracy is one of various imperatives, alongside the aesthetic and ethical. The effectiveness and value of the work of narrative history therefore depends on a synthesis of all three. In bringing what Alan Munslow has described as 'deconstructionist consciousness' to my practice as an author of narrative historical texts, I apply a habit of creative thinking rooted in the pragmatic imperatives of my particular practice. (Anon, n.d.) This was eclectically informed, above all, by the narrative theories of Umberto Eco, Tsvetlan Todorov, Roland Barthes and Paul Ricoeur, among others. However, despite the deconstructionist and semiological character of my theoretical position, it is not defined by any ideological adherence to what Richard Evans has diagnosed as a 'hyper-relativism and scepticism about history's validity as an intellectual enterprise'. (Anon, n.d.) Rather, the origins of my approach to writing history are to be found in my previous work with computationally mediated forms of interactive narrative. Where expertise is invested in a computer system with the intention of generating narrative outcomes, effective human authorship requires the highest level of self-consciousness when designing the data model and the algorithms used to engage with it. This sort of transparent self-consciousness is implicit to Herman Paul's proposal of a 'performative turn' in historical practice, 'focusing upon what historians actually do as opposed to looking at the finished product'. (Anon, n.d.) In this context, the usefulness of a 'deconstructionist consciousness' lies in exposing the operations of the human practitioner in order for them to be externalised and codified, in the greatest possible detail and diversity. Ideally, the aim should be towards systematising the generic rather than the prescriptive: to capture not one version of narrative historical method but the principles that, applied variously and in a different combinations, may produce the widest range of outputs. Nevertheless, there is a more radical agenda involved in the design of such systems that is implicit in my approach to the writing of narrative history. Rather than the intellectual validity of historiographical practice per se, this agenda does involve 'hyperrelativism and scepticism' but in relation to the questions of agency and authority inherent to dynamic and emergent narratives. Indeed, transparency about the rules by which knowledge is constituted being Pierre Machery's criterion of scientific acceptance, I would argue that the ultimate effect of such an approach will be to preserve the validity of that enterprise by making historical method more transparent and accessible. (Anon, n.d.) By these means, the formation of historical knowledge can be rehearsed and owned by the public, in an age when digital technology is rendering 'take it or leave it' performances of authority, of all kinds, ever more problematic and unsustainable. Such an approach to 'open knowledge' is already gaining traction in parts of the academic community where Digital Humanities have made inroads. (Anon, n.d.) In the historical field, this currently applies primarily to the accessibility of data and of the design of tools of digital enquiry and analysis, rather than to the narrative construction, whose challenges involve an additional level of complexity. However, the cognitive processes involved in making history, which begin with and iterate through the formulation of questions, the marshalling of evidence, and the investigation of the patterns in that evidence, do not end there. In analogue forms, it is through their narrative expression that the version of historical truth produced by these processes becomes manifest and amenable to dialogical testing. And yet the construction of narrative is not distinct from those processes that appear to precede it. Rather, they are involuted through iterations that are usually opaque to the reader and perhaps to the authors themselves. Digital forms hold the potential for dialogical testing and negotiation across the full spectrum of those processes. The level of detail and of conceptual sophistication at which this takes place, the degree of scepticism and relativism supported and the constraints imposed may conform dynamically to the reader/user's needs and preferences. In such a dynamic conception of narrative history, the particular subject of historical enquiry remains at the core of the text produced. Recognising that the subject contains no latent, definitive version of itself that can be rendered as narrative, an ideal system of this kind will allow a multiplicity of readers as co-constructors. This may include a reader who pursues a strategy in their interactive 'reading' that evokes Robin Collingwood's belief in a narrative discoverable through informed empathy with the past, another who interrogates the correlation of historical processes to a hypothecated selection of data and builds a narrative from their conclusions, a third who seeks a phenomenological perspective that constellates the subjectivities that can be recovered from a historical moment whilst preserving their indeterminacy. (Anon, n.d.) Or indeed, a single reader who compares and relates all three, and more, swooping from the microcosm to the macrocosmic view, relating the individual to society to larger historical trends, in and across time. Historiography is a discipline that may lead towards self-knowledge of the mind, as well as knowledge of the temporal world. This is most likely to occur, however, if the activity of history-making is undertaken with the sceptical openness and self-reflexivity of the ideal scholar. Magisterially authored historical narratives in analogue form inherently discourage such habits of mind when reading, despite the validating effect of an active hermeneutic within historical discourse. In these terms, it is the conventions of the form, primarily, which restrict and inhibit the agency of the reader, and through which the author imposes their own limitations on reading strategies. Analogue forms are less flexible than those that digital makes possible, since any formal fluidity is constrained by their material fixity, their texts amenable only to mental rather than actual manipulation. Nevertheless, fictional writing has, through its constant experimentation, consistently demonstrated the potential even of the analogue to expose and accommodate diverse hermeneutic habits in order to reveal changing perceptions of human nature and society. Is it possible for historical narratives that embrace the spirit of literary experimentation to help recover a multiplicity of truths about the past, without losing the integrity of the historical method? What is the role of overt analysis and interpretation in such experimentation, and how can the disputative mode be integrated with the narrative? And how does the adoption of new narrative forms, such as the digital medium affords, create new possibilities for historical knowledge? Pompeii: The Living City and The World That Never Was remain, in most respects, within the contemporary conventions of narrative history, though with certain unusual features that lightly probe the possible application of more experimental forms. To understand how these deviations point forward, however, it is helpful to look back to past narrative conventions in historical writing and the concepts that shaped them. In 1967, Barthes wrote of 'this narrative style of history, which draws its \"truth\" from the careful attention to narrative, the architecture of articulations and the abundance of expended elements (known, in this case, as \"concrete details\").' (Anon, n.d.) The model of historiography to which he referred, dominant to the exclusion of almost all others, was the century-old realist novel, which Hegel had described as 'the epic of the middle-class world'. (Anon, n.d.) Emphasising 'mimesis with an epistemological dominant', as described by Brian McHale, the core intent of the realist novel was closely identical with that of historical method: to offer an accurate representation of the world, in which features are emphasised only to accentuate the truthfulness of the narrative. (Anon, n.d.) 'So the circle of paradox is complete,' Barthes had continued. 'Narrative structure, which was originally developed within the cauldron of fiction (in myths and the first epics) becomes at once the sign and the proof of reality.' (Anon, n.d.) Frank Ankersmit even catalogued the stylistic attributes of the realist novel for the purposes of historiography, concluding, 'Time exposition is extremely well-documented and informative, and demonstrates a painful awareness of the writer's subjectivity; a judicious rationing of facts is strived for, the mentality is skeptical; the plot is even-paced and non-dramatic; a dry and direct, transparent style is used, resulting in a \"hurried\" prose that has no patience with superfluous matter, and, lastly, the intentions are didactic'. (Anon, n.d.) This mode of historiographical account was not necessarily exclusive, even when Barthes wrote the Discourse of History. Indeed, it might be argued that the realist novel itself was constantly in flux and various enough to accommodate considerable latitude as a model for the writing of history. Nevertheless, the model of the realist novel was dominant and remains so, half a century on, despite the developments in historiographical theory that have eroded its foundations. These critiques gained purchase during the 1970s through a number of seminal works, including Paul Veyne's Comment on écrit l'histoire (1971), Hayden White's Metahistory (1973), and Michel de Certeau's L'écriture de l'histoire (1975), which inform much of my work in representing the past. For Veyne, history 'remains fundamentally an account, and what is called explanation is nothing but the way in which the account is arranged in a comprehensible plot', while White considered that what historians 'actually wrote was less a report of what they found in their research than of what they had imagined the object of their original interest to consist of'. (Anon, n.d.) That concern with historical bias would be pursued further by Jacques Rancière in The Names of History: On the Poetics of Knowledge, praised by White for its 'very original attempt … to disclose \"the unconscious\" of historical discourse, everything that had to be repressed in order to make possible the specific kinds of historical discourse met with in our culture in our age'. (Anon, 1994) Some of the myriad presumptions underpinning those discourses are more fundamental than others, especially concerning time. As Stefan Tanaka points out in Pasts in a Digital Age, modern conceptions of history did not arise until the late eighteenth century, when people began writing about the past in a linear, chronological structure, that went beyond the sequential chronicle to elaborate social causation. (Anon, n.d.) Reinhart Koselleck traces this formation of the chronotope of 'historical time' to 1800 (a 'watershed' or sattelzeit moment in intellectual history) and its problematisation to Jean-François Lyotard's La condition post-modern. (Anon, n.d.) As Carlyle had written, in 1840: one 'can observe, still more can record, only the series of impressions …while the things done were often simultaneous: the things done were not a series but a group.' (Anon, n.d.) A century on, the historians of the Annales school challenged assumptions of 'uniform time as the medium through which historical phenomena have their existence', arguing that it 'imposes a continuity and homogeneity on diverse phenomena'. (Anon, n.d.) Other rhythms, 'slow but perceptible' or even appearing 'almost changeless', had to be set alongside and above Levi-Strauss's 'history of historians', which was preoccupied with individual lives and overvalued elite agency. (Anon, n.d.) These rhythms demanded a new historiography that was not located within 'a supposedly even and objective flow of time'. (Anon, n.d.) Even these abstract conceptions of time, however, betray culturally specific expectations of chronology. For de Certeau the two are not synonymous. 'Recast in the mold of a taxonomic ordering of things,' he wrote, 'chronology becomes the alibi of time, a way of making use of time without reflecting on it.' (Anon, 1989) Agricultural societies perceive time as cyclical, aligned with the rhythm of the seasons. The ritual of holy days modulates the emotional intensity of these rhythms, as Mircea Eliade, for example, observes, although for him 'the one is an evanescent duration, the other a \"succession of eternities\" … the periodical tune of the calendar flows in a closed circle'. (Anon, 1994) Émile Durkheim, however, had already suggested that the interpolation of intervals of sacred time into the continuities of profane event time arose from the need of religions to differentiate the two spheres. (Anon, n.d.) Industrialised societies implemented the differentiation of time in other terms, through the strict division of work and leisure, which formalised time as a social property and one that was unevenly distributed. 'To be master of one's own time, to control the time of others,' Chartier wrote, paraphrasing Pierre Bourdieu, 'to have no control over time and thus leave it to games of chance: all are incorporated modalities of the relation to time that express the power of the dominant and the vulnerability of the dominated. (Anon, n.d.) This industrial conception of time was enculturated through the 'clock time' that began to regulate social practices, while the advent of the railway timetable promoted temporal homogeneity across technological societies by the turn of the twentieth century. Clock time abstracts the human experience of the temporal, rendering it sequential, quantifiable, accountable, endlessly but meaninglessly renewable. (Anon, 1983) It is an understanding of time different in kind and purpose to an earlier 'spatialized' conception of time that is dependent on space and environment, of which Aron Gurevich writes that, 'Ancient man saw past and present stretching round him, in mutual penetration and clarification of each other'. (Anon, 1985) Kevin Lynch writes of how, 'The sense of the past, which has the original function of informing present action by experience, grows up out of the mental retention of very recent past actions, building up then to the recollection of fragmentary sequences tied together by internal associations, as well as to more playful and continuous fables, and finally to a sense of history as causally connected and temporally coordinated.' (Anon, 1972) The methods proposed by Henri Lefebvre in Rhythmanalysis attempted to capture that complex experience at the most intimate level, and to codify it in terms of the interplay of the multiple rhythms of human existence, biological and contextual, in constantly shifting permutations of consonance and dissonance. Only through the analysis of this process, in a state of endless becoming, he argues, can we apprehend the human sense of 'presence' in time. (Anon, 1989) That apprehension is expanded by Edward Soja, who argues for an understanding of 'spatiality as simultaneously … a social product (or outcome) and a shaping force (or medium) in social life'. (Anon, n.d.) It is at least forty years since such ideas began to permeate the social sciences and latterly the humanities. The application of GIS technologies to historical study, Ann Kelly Knowles has demonstrated, contributed to that interest and has accelerated it. (Anon, n.d.) The 'spatial turn' in historical studies saw increased attention paid to the encoding of power relations in landscape and urban space, a new scholarly interest in real and imagined landscapes, and in the relationships between what Jo Guldi has described as 'the microcosms of everyday life and the macrocosms of global flows'. (Guldi, 1983) In his seminal work The Historical Novel, György Lukacs offers a Marxist interpretation of how the realist novel evolved, in the context of a capitalist economy, into a form that, by representing 'the concrete (i.e. historical) significance of time and place, to social conditions, and so on … created this spatio-temporal (i.e. historical) character of people and places'. (Anon, n.d.) Yet Michel Foucault fundamentally reframed even the notion of an'event' as something that occurs in complex, dynamic relationships of space and time. (Anon, 2002) It becomes, 'not a decision, a treaty, a reign, or a battle, but the reversal of a relationship of forces, the usurpation of power, the appropriation of a vocabulary turned against those who had once used it, a feeble domination that poisons itself as it grows lax, the entry of a masked \"other\".' (Anon, 1980) Can Lukacs' notion of historicity still effectively determine the narrative form in which the past is to be represented, then, when the significance of time and place to social and cultural circumstances is so differently understood? Even the superficial survey of selected revisionist theories of time and space offered in the preceding few paragraphs indicates the many mutually illuminating configurations into which these can be arranged, all the more so when treating the two principles of time and space at a wide range of scales. As Ricoeur observed, 'at each scale one sees things that one does not see at another scale and ... each vision has its own legitimate end.' (Ricoeur, 1984) How, though, to reconcile multiple scales in narrative form? How does a historian write of a 'reversal of a relationship of forces' at a political level through an individual's experience of changed contextual rhythms in their urban environment, for example, or else how might they narrate their discovery of the former in an investigation of the latter? Is such an undertaking possible, or does it multiply the complex causation around events beyond the point of viable retrieval or narration, in the way that Furet believed that narrative became an invalid vehicle for an historical account because the temporality it represented was 'made up of a series of discontinuities described in the mode of the continuous'? (Anon, n.d.) One answer may be suggested, at a local level, by the task of the military historian who must avoid the temptation to 'shine too bright a light through the fog of war', as Timothy Synder wrote in a review of Antony Beevor's Ardennes 1944. 45 'Beevor,' he wrote, 'has the art of preserving the individual perspective on the battlefield while placing it among the perspectives of platoon, regiment, division, commanders, politicians and civilians. The pointillist whole that emerges is convincing as a portrait of war and startling in its detail.' Might such impressionistic license be granted to non-military historians, too, who similarly seek to allow readers to 're-experience the social and human motives which led men to think, feel and act just as they did in historical reality,' and evoke 'the poetic awakening of the people who figured in those events,' such as Lukacs argues that the historical novel should? (Anon, n.d.) Ginzburg saw this hope expressed in the 'cognitive wager' that the (predominantly) factual genre of 'Italian microhistory' offered its readers, through its 'accentuation of the constructive moment inherent in the research … combined with an explicit rejection of the skeptical implications (postmodernist, if you will) so largely present in European and American historiography of the 1980s and early 1990s'. Its self-consciousness concerned, 'the identification of the object and its importance; the elaboration of the categories through which it is analyzed; the criteria of proof; the stylistic and narrative forms by which the results are transmitted to the reader'. (Anon, n.d.) For Giovanni Levi, Ginzburg's colleague in the microhistorical project, its primary purpose was ideological: to respond to the crisis of the 'great Marxist and functionalist systems' that shaped much historiography of the time. (Anon, n.d.) Ginzburg, writing in reflective mode, recollects how the alternative, personal inspiration for the endeavour lay in the example of two very different literary innovators, one (the nouveau romancier Raymond Queneau) subverting, the other, Leo Tolstoy, extending the realist model of the novel. 'Tolstoy's grand and intrinsically unrealizable project,' wrote Ginzburg, was 'the reconstruction of the numerous relationships that linked Napoleon's headcold before the battle of Borodino, the disposition of the troops, and the lives of all the participants in the battle, including the most humble soldier. In Tolstoy's novel the private world (peace) and the public (war) first run along parallel lines, now they intersect …' (Anon, n.d.) Ginzburg is aware that the narrative assimilation of disparate, fragmentary data was how Tolstoy 'communicate [s] to the reader the physical, palpable certainty of reality' that can only take place 'in the realm of invention' that is precluded to the historian. Yet in Ginzburg's aspiration to write comprehensive history, he is not deterred by any incompatibility of method. Rather, he seeks a form in which the 'lacunae or misrepresentations' encountered in the research process become integral to the account, accepting 'the limitations while exploring the gnoseological implications and transforming them into a narrative element'. (Anon, n.d.) To address the narrative challenges raised by the incompatibilities of Tolstoyan ambition and historiographical rectitude, Ginzburg suggests that historians seek alternatives to the certainties implicit in omniscient, authorial narration in the work of 'Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Robert Musil'. (Anon, n.d.) However, it was in the historical musings of film theorist Siegfried Kracauer, posthumously published as History: The Last Things before the Last, that Ginzburg discovered 'the best introduction to microhistory,' expressed through the grammar of another medium entirely. For Kracauer, in Ginzburg's paraphrase, the solution was to be found in cinematic grammar: 'a constant back-and-forth between micro-and macrohistory, between close-ups and extreme long shots, so as to continually thrust back into discussion the comprehensive vision of the historical process through apparent exceptions and cases of brief duration.' (Anon, n.d.) In a recent lecture, 'Big Data, Small Data and Meaning', Tim Hitchcock surveyed the current state of activity and discussion around the notion of the Macroscope, currently a design fiction of an ideal instrument of historical investigation. (Anon, n.d.) Such a tool promises, he noted, quoting Katy Börner, 'a visualisation tool that allows a single data point to be both visualised at scale in the context of a billion other data points, and drilled down to its smallest compass' that will 'let us observe what is at once too great, slow, or complex for the human eye and mind to notice and comprehend.' 54 This raises concerns, however, for what might be overlooked: 'the tiny fragments of everyday life -the narratives of everyday experience' that have been used by Bourdieu and de Certeau, among others 'to build a compelling framework illustrating the currents and sub-structures of power'; the 'closely described lives, built from fragments and details, made emotionally compelling by being woven into ever more precise fabrics of explanation.' 55 These are important concerns that recognise how knowledge formation is shaped by models of historiographical process that may be hard-wired into the tools of enquiry. They demand an approach to computational history that addresses the design of the systems through which these models will be deployed, considering user needs across a spectrum of scale and from a multiplicity of perspectives. Absent even from this discussion of historical process, however, is the question of the narrative forms through which historiographical research is likely to be communicated. The language of 'building' historical understanding invokes a constructionist method that is shared with narrative historiography, while an evidential method must remain fundamental to both processes. Just as the design of the Macroscope should encompass the needs of a wide range of researchers, therefore, so too it should be defined with a view to the specifically digital forms that the narrative construction of their research might assume. Ultimately, those forms will incorporate a reproducible performance of the research methods by which the historical knowledge that they represent is constituted, and ideally this form will appeal a wide range of users. As demonstrated by the inspiration that Ginzburg found in Tolstoy, narrative innovation may illuminate new historical practice and new kinds of knowledge formation, while imposing rigorous demands on how the solutions to the challenges it raises are refined. The design of a tool for historiographical work should be a tunnel dug from both ends: investigatory method and narrative construction. The current fascination among historians with networks and their visualisation suggests where such a tool might be beneficial. This interest echoes the contemporary experience of online communication and society, of which Foucault wrote, presciently, 'We are at a moment, I believe, when our experience of the world is less that of a long life developing through time than that of a network that connects points and intersects with its own skein'. (Anon, n.d.) It also reflects the increasing availability of historical data in high volume, onto which network visualisation provides a gratifying window, representing myriad associations that would be infinitely laborious to trace without such tools. Anyone who has been asked to appreciate a sprawling spider diagram will recognise the bewilderment that often ensues, but network analysis using visualisation techniques is becoming ever more sophisticated in identifying significance in the graph. However, such methods remain of limited efficacy in tracing and recording sequences of causation, for example, or as means to expose narrative or emplotment in the information they display. Guidance may be suggested by pioneering literary studies that are beginning to uncover how narratological approaches could illuminate the complex networks of spatial, temporal and other forms that shape societies and their narrative representation. As well as offering a variable scale, the Macroscope must also allow relationships to be traced within and between forms. It must embrace an understanding of 'network society' such as that proposed by Manuel Castells, which sees the 'space of places' transformed into a 'space of flows', and in which space-time relationships turn, in Wolfgang Schmale's words, into 'flowing, unbounded categories'. (Anon, n.d.) In her recent book Forms: Whole, Rhythm, Hierarchy, Network, Caroline Levine theorises how a multiplicity of forms, in different configurations and with varying affordances -interdependent, overlapping and colliding -afford a common basis for new analytical models across social and literary studies. She cites the drama series The Wire as a possible 'new model for literary and cultural studies scholarship' in that it 'conceptualises social life as both structured and rendered radically unpredictable by large numbers of social forms, including bounded wholes, rhythms, hierarchies, and networks. Dependent on a narrative logic that traces the effects of each formal encounter on the next, it refuses to posit a deep, prior, metaphysical model of causality to explain the world. By tracking vast numbers of social patterns as they meet, reroute, and disrupt one another, The Wire examines the world that results from a plurality of forms at work.' (Anon, n.d.) Levine also rehearses a new analysis of Dickens's Bleak House that casts 'narrative persons less as powerful and symbolic agents in their own right than as moments in which complex and invisible social forces cross' while observing that 'in order to represent a world of networks, the text must refuse totality'. (Anon, n.d.) The webs of interconnectedness may be glimpsed and hinted at but cannot ever be more than partial. Intellectual methods and software tools used to discover and articulate the narratives latent in the ever more complex and 'deeply' interwoven networks that shape the present may also illuminate those in historical data. Consequently, the past will become redeemable with ever greater immediacy yet be ever more elusive of certainty. The ground-level subjectivities of historical experience will be tantalising close but out of reach, the sense of historicity more fragile and more intense. The challenges posed to narrative construction by the 'lacunae and misrepresentations' that Ginzburg identified as stemming from his Tolstoyan ambitions for historiography will assume sharper relief as data becomes more abundant. Greater ingenuity will be required to devise responsive forms into which the uncertainty and partiality of historical knowledge can be folded, that both allow for the subjectivities of historical experience and ensure narrative coherence. When the film theorist Kracauer used the language of close-ups and long shots to evoke his ideal of a historical work that bridged the micro and macro scales, the example he had in mind was the Annaliste historian Marc Bloch's great history of Feudal Society, published in 1939. (Anon, n.d.) In aiming to reconstitute what has been described as '\"a total social ambiance\" of complex structures of collective consciousness and action' Bloch had nevertheless eschewed any narrative imperative in favour of the topical arrangement of case studies. In the imagination of a film theorist, cinematic language was deployed conceptually to shape a 'fundamentally discontinuous and heterogeneous' reality into a textual form that could be readily apprehended as narrative. (Anon, n.d.) It is a helpful insight, I think, when considering the poetics of digital historiography, which suggests a need for new grammars and conventions of interactivity. 'After the novel, and subsequently cinema, privileged narrative as the key form of cultural expression of the modern age, the computer age introduces its correlate -the database,' the media theorist Lev Manovich claimed in his 1999 article Database as Symbolic Form. (Anon, n.d.) He boldly asserted that the database was itself a medium immanent with potential, which 'represents the world as a list of items', and is in direct conflict with narrative, which merely produces 'a cause-and-effect trajectory of seemingly unordered items (events)'. It was through the interfaces to a database that the digital text became manifest but, for Manovich, the design conventions of the time were too enslaved to the sequential conventions of cinema, 'the dominant semiological order of the twentieth century'. The result was a linear, linked text, stepping from one screen (or 'scripton') to the next, through links. It was, Manovich argued, referencing semiological theory, a syntagmatic form masquerading as paradigmatic: the explicit narrative statement discovered in the database was prioritised over the implicit, imagined possibility of narrative. (Anon, n.d.) In an act of media archaeology avant la lettre, undertaken at around the same time that I was researching the value of Eisenstein's theory of montage as a principle of 'associative' interaction, Manovich discovered in the early Russian film documentarist Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera his ideal cinematic expression of an approach that reversed the hierarchy of paradigm and syntagm. It 'traverses its database in a particular order to construct an argument. Records drawn from a database and arranged in a particular order become a picture of modern life -but simultaneously an argument about this life, an interpretation of what these images, which we encounter every day, every second, actually mean.' Its 'banal, mechanical catalog of subjects which one can expect to find' in the city of the 1920s were rendered into 'anything but a banal experience' through the 'most amazing catalog of the film techniques contained within it'. That is, the static database becomes 'dynamic and subjective' since the 'process of discovery is the film's main narrative and it is told through a catalog of discoveries being made'. (Anon, n.d.) Might such techniques be applied to historiography, or else what alternative techniques and strategies could achieve similar effects? One of the most striking attempts in recent decades at a new kind of (text-based) historiography founded on principles similar to the paradigmatic database is Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time, published the year before Manovich's essay. Gumbrecht believed that a new 'configuration of time' was replacing the mode of 'historical thinking' that had persisted since the nineteenth century, but that our knowledge of the past remained constrained by the discredited narrative forms of historical writing. The chronotope of 'historical time', in which time was the 'absolute agent of change', was obsolete since 'the presence with its synchronicities grow[s] ever wider'. In response, Gumbrecht set out to restore an appropriate sense of 'presence' to historicity, a quality of being-in-theworld that he considered to have been lost in the humanities' focus on interpretation. (Anon, n.d.) The fascinating result was a work of fifty-one chapters arranged into three sections: 'Arrays' (eg. 'Engineers', 'Gramophones', 'Ocean Liners'), 'Codes' (binaries such as 'Authenticity vs Artificiality') and 'Codes Collapsed' (eg. 'Individual = Collectivity (Leader)'). 'Each entry,' Gumbrecht explained, 'is supposed to reach maximum surfacefocus and concreteness … the style and the structure of the entries … determined by the individual phenomena that each of them thematizes.' (Anon, n.d.) The reader is invited to begin anywhere, follow cross-references, and end anywhere. It is an ingenious work of analogue hypertext and, to my mind, remarkably successful in its aims: its 'scriptons' offer a model of composing multivalent knowledge, their individual meanings variously amplified by whichever the reader arrives at next, the whole producing a sense of historical immersion. 67 However, Gumbrecht admits in the accompanying 'User's Guide' that its synchronic and hypertextual form eschews not only unilinearity but coherence and, with it, closure. In this, arising from its lack of emplotment, 1926 is an historiographical anti-narrative of the sort that White states, with reference to modernist texts, 'would be in Ricoeur's estimation a contradiction in terms'. (Anon, n.d.) My reading of Ricoeur's Time and Narrative had both influenced my aspirations as a writer of historiographical metafiction and my subsequent dissatisfaction with hypertext, and determination to develop other principles of digital narrative. From the perspective of historiographical practice, rather than fictional experimentation, Ricoeur's ideas similarly suggest the need for a poetics of digital history that ensures that certain narrative criteria are met as a fundamental requirement of its validity. Temporality is, for Ricoeur, 'the structure of existence that reaches language in narrativity', while narrativity is 'the language structure that has temporality as its ultimate referent'. (Anon, n.d.) It is, therefore, through narrative and emplotment that historical events find their equivalent structure and can become part of the general discourse. As White explains: 'By emplotment, a sequence of events is \"configured\" (\"grasped together\") in such a way as to represent \"symbolically\" what would otherwise be unutterable in language, namely, the ineluctable \"aporetic\" nature of the human experience of time.' 70 It had been a principle of my earlier work with digital media that computational systems invested with 'authorial expertise' could shape the dynamic construction of narrative traces through data space in a manner that ensured an experience of both coherence and closure: two key elements of a satisfying story. In these terms, the interactive medium therefore holds the potential to both preserve that correspondence between emplotment and the deep structures of temporality, as Riceour understands it, and, simultaneously, expose for negotiation that aporia: the doubt and uncertainty about the status of the correspondence, and whether the preferred narrative is the most truthful historical account. As a rhetorical device, implicit in Ricoeur's use of the term, aporia implies an appeal to an audience for confirmation or reassurance. In the case of an interactive medium, user and system become one another's audience, engaged in a dialogic process whose aim is to constellate the elements of the narrative -including, in Levine's terms, the multiple forms that underlie it -into the preferred narrative arrangement, while simultaneously recognising the possibility of alternatives. The static narrative text becomes one in process. The process is playful and ironic, since it requires the reader or user to hold in mind more than one idea or possible world, which may be contradictory and are certainly ambiguous. In this process, theories of the 'storyworld', the 'chronotope' and of 'possible worlds' on which I drew in my earlier work with fictional narratives in analogue and digital form (see Appendix, pp.64, 65, 66), seem to me highly pertinent. Ludomir Dolozel has addressed the application of possible worlds theory, writing that, 'Historical texts, constrained by the requirement of truth-valuation, construct historical worlds which are models of the actual world's past. One and the same historical event or sequence of events (historical period, life, and so on) can be modelled by various historical worlds. In a critical testing, these worlds are assessed as more or less adequate to the actual past'. (Anon, n.d.) Two 'semantically unhomogeneous' worlds (Dolozel's words) can, Joaquín Lorente explains, 'be postulated to explain the different opinions and reactions of two individuals concerning the same section of the action'. (Anon, n.d.) These 'transuniverse relations', Ryan writes, 'serve as a theoretical backdrop to explain the different ways in which a reader detects and makes sense of narrative unreliability.' (Anon, n.d.) Each of these historical worlds, comprising distinct but overlapping and cognate 'ontological landscapes', has as its ultimate referent the temporality of the 'actual world's past'. (Anon, n.d.) The perceived identity of the two, or the discrepancy between them, allows the reader to assess the reliability of a narrative account. However, as a strategy to establish that identity, the narrated path through the storyworld (as hypothetically complete ontological model) may encompass multiple possible worlds. This equates to the heteroglossic method which Bakhtin defines as 'another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way' and in which, for him, the power of the novel originates and resides. (Anon, n.d.) However, a work of narrative historyunable, for example, to ventriloquise imagined characters -is constrained in the means and material available to express this heteroglossia, and has an obligation to be cautious and transparent in its handling of them. The chronotopic organisation of time and space (and their subsidiary elements and affordances) and the management of transitions between chronotopes in the historical narrative afford, I would argue, the most powerful and versatile mechanism to achieve a multi-perspectival narrative. Karl Schlögel's Moscow 1937, published in German at around the same time as The World That Never Was, is an extraordinary history of an extraordinary moment, one that was variously characterised by contemporaries as 'the whirlpool of history', 'the maelstrom', 'the Witches' Sabbath', 'the machinery of terror'. (Anon, n.d.) It was a year, he writes, in which 'no one can say exactly where reality ceases and the imagination begins'. In the Introduction, Schlögel articulates his aspirations for the book, the tensions between them, and the limitations of what the linear analogue form available to him can contain. 'A history that is tied to a particular time or space implicitly acknowledges the synchronicity of the non-synchronous, the coexistence and co-presence of the disparate. The location guarantees complexity. The stereoscope all-round view is designed to bring events together; it is better suited to the disparate nature of the world than is a strenuous, concentrated tunnel vision. … An all-round view sensitive to time and space sets relationships in motion that are paralysed by a more concentrated method which focuses on particular points.' 77 A comprehensive poetics of digital narrative history would allow, through a dialogic and constructionist process, an order to be imposed on that stereoscopic maelstrom that, at the same, contains its own provisionality, memorialising Ginzburg's conjectural paradigm of historical method by which clues and traces are followed towards a production of knowledge that is 'indirect, presumptive, conjectural'. (Anon, n.d.) It would embrace a performative understanding of history-making, if only performed for an audience of one. This recalls the 'performative turn' for which Paul has argued, that focuses on the process of what historians do as opposed to the finished product. (Anon, n.d.) Its mode and register would be variable. At one extreme it would approximate Chartier's scholarly 'theatre of erudition' which 'does not guarantee the possibility that history can produce adequate knowledge of the past', but in which, accordion to Norman Klein, 'scholarly evidence operates as special effects' and where 'the honest scholar should try to keep those fictional tracks right on the surface'. (Anon, n.d.) At the other, fictional license would allow speculation to bleed out, beyond the lacunae that micro historians would legitimately allow it to fill. Counterfactual interpretations could be rehearsed on a stage on which evidential actors jostled, each item of evidence equipped, like an improvisational actor, with semantic selfawareness, knowledge of its past roles, and a loose scenario for how it might figure in the currently emerging narrative. In the analogue work of narrative history, in which the performance is fixed and scripted, similar strategies may still be useful but they require delicate sequencing and nuanced signalling. Eco likens reading to one's passage through a wooded landscape, in which the 'first-level' Model Reader will attend only to the natural chronology of events, the story or fabula, in a headlong and credulous rush, while the 'second-level' Model Reader will focus on the plot and narrative chronology, 'and enjoy time spent in the textual forest'. (Anon, n.d.) Where questions of reliability and uncertainty, of the contingent and provisional, are allowed to enter the historiographical narrative, the reader must become attuned to this. She must be encouraged to adopt the consciousness of Eco's 'secondlevel' model reader. This tuning of the reader may be achieved by various means, including some borrowed from postmodern fiction. Irony, ambiguity, ostensible tensions between fact and fiction, and narratorial unreliability can all be deployed, with Stephan Jaeger asserting the benefit of the latter in 'exposing the performative process of making history and its infinite and incomplete nature'. Deft management of the chronotopes in the text, too, might serve this additional purpose: the genres that they constitute may be juxtaposed or blurred, encoding a signal of narrative instability for decipherment by the attentive reader. Such an effect is inherent, for example, in the genre of the fantastic, whose author, according to Edmund Little, breaches the contract with the reader by creating what he terms a Tertiary World, whose relationship to the actual world is less certain than that of the Secondary Worlds that all creative writers describe. (Anon, n.d.) The effect produced is, for Amaryll Chanady, one of antinomy, the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes in the text. (Anon, 1985) For Todorov, it is 'hesitation' on the part of the reader, as they waver momentarily between a preternatural or 'marvellous' explanation of narrative events. (Anon, 1973) That hesitation, that instant of scepticism, is fundamental to the responsible practice of narrative historiography, and essential to introduce where the limits of evidential reliability are transgressed, for example when the subjectivities of the past are recounted, and the reader is invited to adopt greater agency in discerning the historical truth. Take this sentence: The axe fell on the block and the king's head tumbled, in the forest at full moon. The time and place, while possible in a non-fictional world, are more appropriate to fairytale than political history. The chronotope and the genre implied immediately puts the reader of an ostensibly historical narrative on their guard. In this concluding section, I shall consider how Pompeii: The Living City and The World That Never Was [TWTNW] manifest certain of the key principles that I have proposed for a possible poetics of digital historiography. These fall into three main categories: chronotopic construction; narrative, analysis and fictionality; signalling unreliability. The specific application of the principles varies between the two books, and the categories are not discrete: an approach adopted in one category can impact another. For example, the management of chronotopic organisation in Pompeii maintains an explicit distinction between fictional narrative and analysis, while in TWTNW I aimed to integrate the two, defining a narrative mode in which analysis was implicit. This distinction, in turn, required different strategies of signalling the status and reliability of the accounts presented. The critical assessment of reader response is apposite in the case of two books that set out to effect slight but significant shifts in the expectations of readers regarding authoritative historical narrative. Based on my quite comprehensive survey of the published reader response to the books, printed and online, the reviews for both books were predominantly approving, approximately a ratio of 7:3, positive to negative. They were, though, also polarised, with many tending towards extremes of opinion. I have interpreted this polarisation of response as reflecting the individual reader's acceptance or rejection of the books' innovations in the three categories I am assessing. The reviews in question usefully elucidate how successfully I managed to signal to the reader that she should adopt particular sceptical and critical reading strategies, even though the reviewers rarely articulate their criticism explicitly in these terms. The textual structure of Pompeii rests on a foundational 'thick' mapping of the town's networks and infrastructural systems, as they can be deciphered from the archaeology of the Pompeiian ruins and the prosopographical evidence they contain. From this I compiled a multi-layered graph that cross-referenced place, time, person, object and event with the networks that organised them within a functioning society. The method approximates that recently described by Todd Presner in Hypercities, addressing 'the multiplicity, heterogeneity, and ambiguity of the cultural record of places' in order to accommodate 'an employment of many narratives and voices at once'. (Anon, n.d.) Presner references anthropologist Clifford Geetz's notion of 'thick description' as connoting 'a kind of cultural analysis trained on the ... stratificatory and contextual realities in which human beings act and create', which combines 'micro and macro analyses'. (Anon, 1979) To make the complexity of this 'mapping' intelligible to the reader, I devised a narrative framework for Pompeii that correlated and harmonised multiple temporalities. Chapters alternated local Pompeiian history and wider imperial Roman history, the former designated by Arabic numerals, the latter by Roman. The 'local' chapters were assigned (along with their Arabic numerals) titles whose opaque allusion to the chapter's theme created a tension that opened space for interpretation. Each of these chapters described a single, dated month set within the sequence of the 'imperial', Romannumbered chapters, with a porosity of event between the two. The overall arrangement of the chapters followed a linear chronology, but within both chapter types the background to the people, events and places to which they referred could be explored. Pompeii was an agrarian, trading society, with religious and ritual practices that integrated widely varied traditions; 'fasti', or days when public activity was sanctioned, were mixed with 'nefasti'. Structuralist analysis tells us that each society produces its own temporality, with cross-rhythms that resist a purely chronological presentation. (Anon, n.d.) To evoke the alien particularity of the storyworld, and render it empathetically knowable, but preserve its historicity, these ritual and cyclical rhythms needed to be integral to the narrative. Each 'local' chapter was, therefore, shaped around recurring events of the given month and its season -farming, trading, civic, ritual, etc -as well as the singular chronicle events with which they coincided. The central theme and the associated events of the particular month in each chapter determined, in turn, the social functions that particular individuals might perform within it: candidature for magisterial election, for example, or celebration of an ancestor feast, or the manufacture of perfume for sale at gladiatorial games. These instantiations of roles were variously fixed in time, set within parameters, or sequentially relational. For example: an imperial visitor in a particular year; an aedile whose age meant that his dates of election to office must fall within certain years; records known from layered, palimpsestic graffiti, that must follow the order in which the graffiti was painted. Pompeii's chapters were intended to individually foreground each calendar month but it became necessary to repeat a month (March): chapters two and four originally comprised a single chapter, with March both the month of elections and the earliest date in the season when a merchant ship could arrive safely from Egypt, but this single chapter was split before the writing process began. Individuals and their patronage networks were tied to a particular election year but a 'trade' chapter was needed earlier to establish Pompeii as a port and mercantile economy. Constructing a text that integrates multiple, integrating strands of narrative across different scales of historical enquiry requires the meticulous planning of when information is seeded and elaborated. The reader must accumulate knowledge in order to understand new ideas when they are introduced, without that process becoming congested. An understanding of the structures of trade between Pompeii, its hinterland, the East and Rome, for example, is gradually developed over multiple chapters. Similarly, the institutions of social control are explained in Chapter 5, allowing the premonitory note at the end of the subsequent 'imperial' Chapter V concerning Neronian decadence, that 'it would not have taken much for the rules that had shaped society for centuries to come tumbling down'. Whereas in Pompeii I had prioritised time and event as the anchors for the chronotopic construction of narrative, in TWTNW the greater richness of the historical record allowed an organisation of the material that placed emphasis on place and character. The narrative that I discerned and chose to represent was biographically focused, but interpreted the individual in relation to their role within the diasporic networks of revolutionary ideology and activism. These networks had a near global reach but became more or less concentrated at particular moments across time. The processes of contraction and dilation were both geographical and intellectual, each mapping variably onto the other, and often expressed through events: revolutions, congresses, imprisonment, terrorist conspiracies. Often they centred on key locations: Paris, St Petersburg, London, Geneva and the Jura, to a lesser extent Chicago, Moscow, Belgium. Individuals were the primary vectors that carried ideas and the capacity for activating local network development, and so catalysed moments of change or reversal. However, their mobilities could be augmented or surrogated through the technologies of transport and communication -railways and telephony -rendering space and time elastic. (Anon, n.d.) Almost inevitably, points of concentration in the activities of the revolutionary world were mirrored by the attention of the secret police of different countries, who surveilled them but also became entangled with them as a result of infiltration and provocation. Certain zones of different networks elided through the agency of 'bridge' figures in ways that were often difficult to discern clearly, and my exploration of these liminal areas of exchange generated another structural layer within the narrative. I had, as Peter Preston remarked in his review, 'to put the terror of decades into a frame of understanding that even those in the thick of it couldn't always discern'. (Anon, n.d.) The lineaments of the 'actual' world were obscured even for participants by the miasma of 'possible worlds' that abounded, whose promulgation as alternative, achievable or threatening realities was an important objective of the diverse protagonists. Sustaining these 'possible worlds' were the twin drivers of revolutionary socialist teleology and its mirror image in conspiracy theories. However, while both imaginaries were directed towards a final moment -of catastrophe and/or utopia -my concern was to understand the role of contingent factors in the lives, relationships and communities that generated them. My authorial intention can be described by reference to Bart Keunen's theory of the 'dialogic chronotope', which describes a narrative that is 'not directed towards a final moment, to a \"telos\", but rather consists of a network of conflicting situations and junctions that communicate with one another'. (Anon, n.d.) He proposes three sub-categories, the tragic, comic and tragicomic, in which, respectively: 'conflict characters' or 'balanced characters' dominate, or where there are no dominating characters. TWTNW seeks to disrupt the readers' sense of both historical and narrative stability through frequent shifts between these and other subsidiary chronotopes, including that of the 'fantastic', within the broader framework of the chapters. Each chapter is roughly sequential but chronologically overlapping, constructed around one or two key characters, whose individual story advances that of the diaspora more widely. It reflects their experience at that moment in the development of ideas and influences: 'waxing, waning, splitting constantly, spread around the globe for decades'. (Anon, n.d.) Through their movement and activities, these characters frequently configure new perspectives on familiar aspects of the storyworld, allowing the narrative to shift scale. The chapters may also serve thematic ends, as for example with the excursions into stories of marginal, self-sustaining experiments in communal living. Lucy Hughes-Hallett understood that, 'In a condition of anarchy there are no leaders. Butterworth, accordingly, has no single hero'. (Anon, n.d.) However, US readers in particular were divided about the effectiveness of the approach: 'Bozo McGinty' was not alone in finding it 'a rambling mess'; on the other hand, 'Clary' was representative too in commending how the book takes an 'immensely complicated subject and traces it across the world and through scores of actors to tell a story that is as entertaining as it is informative'. (Anon, n.d.) However, in seeking to capture the subjectivities and contingencies of what Preston called 'one of history's great cul de sacs', it seemed appropriate to me to use a mode that incorporated diverse elements, including the shaggy dog story and the picaresque. 10 To render the microhistory of Pompeiian society accessible as narrative, the analytical synthesis of evidence was be focalised through human experience. The dramadocumentary The Private Lives of Pompeii had stretched the conventions of the format by including fifteen fictionalised scenes that sketched a drama of interwoven Pompeiian lives. (Anon, n.d.) The book took the approach further, establishing a coherent fictional storyworld over a larger canvas and across two generations. This storyworld was glimpsed through vignettes, three in each chapter, whose fictional status was distinguished by the italicisation of the text. These evoked moments of imagined history grounded in wellresearched evidence, providing the reader with recognisable human points of identification. I used fictional strategies, such as suspense and access to the interior world of the characters, to generate narrative momentum and empathy. This entailed the additional structural consideration of character development, requiring information to be seeded about named individuals. The mechanisms for this spanned the italicised vignettes and the non-italicised analytical sections. The relationship between the imagined focalisation and the factual analysis was complex: the latter pivoted on the vignettes, establishing and critiquing the evidence on which they were based and tacitly prompting the reader to question the relationship of the analysis to the fiction. While Mary Beard mocked the possibility of this kind of concatenated deductive reconstruction ('you don't need to know much about archaeology to realise that a signet ring lost behind a cupboard need not necessarily belong to the house's owner'), other classicists and historians appreciated the method. (Anon, n.d.) Peter Jones noted how 'the authors carve out their path, intercutting historical developments with topics and snapshots to cast light on a vast range of subjects.' Jeremy Paterson appreciated how 'the lives of individual Pompeiians are reconstructed from inscriptions, graffiti, memorials, houses and decoration, and the clutter of everyday living that they left behind them.' (Anon, n.d.) I would frame the relationship between the two distinct textures of each 'local' chapter in chronotopic terms: that notion of time-space relationships that curdle into tangible genres of narrative. (Anon, n.d.) In the overtly fictional vignettes, time and space crystalise briefly, incarnating specific figures that otherwise exist only as speculatively assembled 'point clouds' of fragmentary data. (Anon, n.d.) By contrast, the non-italicised sections hold in suspension the specific configurations of time and space that define event. Intermittently the constituents of this chronotope thicken too with the disputative text to reveal generic events that offer exemplary insights into the world, before rapidly deliquescing. The narrative development through character occurs primarily in the moments of incarnation that take place in the vignettes, but also through the analytical assessment of the data from which these moments are constructed. For example, Aulus Pumpinius Magonianus first appears incidentally in a Chapter 7 vignette, and is then foregrounded in a Chapter 8 vignette. However, he is more fully realised in the non-italicised, discursive sections of that chapter where the reader is: told of his home's proximity to the temple of Aesculapius, the healer deity; shown the medical instruments found there and the plaster casts of the roots of medicinal herbs from his garden; and given a survey of the medical history that relates to them. (Anon, n.d.) Chapter 12, set in 75 CE, is the last to follow the established pattern of vignettes and analysis. Several years after the upheaval of the earthquake and the civil war, the city is seen settling into a new order: the chapter concludes with a vignette in which an official observes the last moments of a gladiatorial combat. In Chapter XII, as the book's conclusion approaches, the conventions break down. The 'imperial' chapter here comprises only two pages of inscriptions and programmata from the walls of Pompeii: the fragmentary voices by which its inhabitants would speak to the future. Chapter 13 dispenses with vignettes. Fact and fiction finally collapse into one another, the reader confronting the pathos and terror of the Vesuvian eruption. Characters who the reader has come to know are presented, in their last non-italicised moments, unencumbered with conditionality about their factual status, before resolving into the skeletal remains on which they have been based. 'It is the great achievement of this book that we feel we know these people, and their tragedy moves us,' wrote Jane Stevenson, while Alan Quinlan felt that the use of the vignettes contributed to a reading experience that was 'visceral … graphic, ambitious and compelling'. (Anon, n.d.) Reviewing TWTNW, John Gray qualified his enthusiasm by noting that, 'Butterworth has opted to present the anarchists in a mode that emphasizes narrative over analysis ... One cannot help wishing there were more extended analysis, however, for when Butterworth does offer broader observations, they are exceptionally astute.' (Anon, n.d.) Other reviews too, though by no means all, regretted a lack of 'analysis' and of 'intellectual context'. (Anon, n.d.) A number of considerations influenced my decision to adopt this approach, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the historical material with which I had chosen to work. I had a strong desire, as an author, to explore the possibilities of writing a narrative history that was novelistic in its capacity to evoke individual experience and contingency, while relating ideas and behaviour across different scales of observed society. This derived, in part, from the interesting possibilities for narrative innovation suggested by my digital work, but also from a sense that Pompeii had been compromised by the self-imposed strictures of a formal distinction between narrative and analysis. I felt that to embrace a more analytical or disputative mode risked either imposing too definitive an authorial interpretation on a subject that was naturally nebulous -the quest for a perfect world, and the fears this provoked -or else amplifying the uncertainties and ambiguities that characterised the historical record to the point where narrative coherence broke down. Preston thought it 'no wonder ... that historians haven't lingered too long over some of the stars of this dotty saga'. (Anon, n.d.) The reductive or indulgent accounts of the subject that have often shaped popular understanding seemed to derive precisely from a complacency in finding forms that could address that paradox. My solution, although imperfect, demonstrated an alternative approach, in which a prismatic, even kaleidoscopic account of the period aimed to produce unexpected consonances, juxtapositions and counterpoints that revealed potential tensions and ironies in a conventional reading of the narratives. The slippage between 'possible worlds' and chronotopes, the subtle sliding of genre, the interplay of forms (in Levine's terms) and shifting of scales would, I hoped, prompt a heightened creative and critical agency on the part of the reader: Ricoeur's 'aporia'. (Anon, n.d.) The response of readers leads me to think that, while this was highly effective for some, for others it was not at all. As with Pompeii, this balance of response was broadly satisfactory, except that I suspect that the book did not change minds, but instead confirmed established inclinations to open or closed patterns of thought. Unfortunately, I received no response from Karl Rove to my email asking for his response to the book, which he had included on his 'summer reading' list in 2010. (Anon, 1994) The one opinion that I found chastening was that offered by Sheila Rowbotham. 'What drove the dreamers to risk their lives for a better world that they no longer would experience?' she asked, identifying shortcomings of which I was half-aware. (Anon, n.d.) While I had been striving to maintain the narrative structure and momentum of 'an exhilarating gallop' (Francis Wheen) across a 'bewildering, almost panoramic canvas where devotees and the damned intermingle' (Preston), the context of suffering and injustice had diminished in view as the book progressed. (Anon, n.d.) This is, in retrospect, a significant weakness in a book that, in other ways, tries to glimpse the mental world of its subjects. agency, other strategies too were used. In TWTNW, where the text appeared unitary and consistent, similar and additional strategies were more fundamental in realising these aims. One of these was the use of analepsis. The manipulation of chronology in narrative is a common feature of modernist fiction and, in postmodernist form, or 'historiographical metafiction', in which, as McHale explains, there is a shift from epistemological questions of 'How am I to understand the world?' to the ontological question of 'Which world is this? What is to be done in it?' (Anon, 1989) However, such manipulation is unusual in factual historical narratives. Although little remarked on by reviewers, both Pompeii and TWTNW manipulate linear chronology in both subtle and overt ways. Take, for example, their analeptic prologues where they predict events that will fall later in the main narrative, or beyond its frame, boldly signalling the need for reading strategies that acknowledge the unconventionality of their narratives. The Pompeii Prologue precedes the Introduction, presenting the reader with an italicised vignette. Written in a self-conscious and unrestrained mode of historical fiction -'he had travelled far', 'the land that thirsts', 'without cease' -it narrates a moment of exotic orientalism. A Roman Prefect sits beneath the mysterious 'singing statue' of Memnon at dawn, recollecting the Pompeii he once visited, as the volcanic dust from the Vesuvian eruption falls in desert. The Prologue ends by leaving a question hanging: 'Could anyone from Pompeii possibly have survived?' (Anon, 1994) Unlike subsequent vignettes, the italicised Prologue is isolated from explanation, analysis or provenance. Only at some future point, after the reader has developed an emotional engagement with the characters, will the Prefect's question finally be answered. The interim, between the book's opening and closing pages, is framed by the literary artifice of a rhetorical manipulation of time: what Bal terms an 'embedded' or 'hypo narrative'. (Anon, n.d.) The intended effect is a fundamental destabilisation of the authority of the narrating voice expected in conventional historical writing. The effect is compounded by the Introduction, which throws the reader forward seventeen centuries to the first excavation of the buried city, before exploring the process by which the city has been recovered, and the challenges presented by the material record, as well as outlining the intention of the book and its method, offering both explicit and implicit caveats. Only on the last page of the Introduction do we return to Egypt, to discover that the Prefect's visit to Memnon shortly after the destruction of Pompeii is not only factually verifiable but, improbably, is literally written in stone: the Prefect had, like many visitors, carved his name in the base of the statue. (Anon, 2011) To reinforce the earlier monitory temporal destabilisation, the first 'local' chapter opens with an ending, a death that marks the chronological start of the narrative; the following 'imperial chapter' offers a further temporal jolt, first rewinding two millennia, then fast-forwarding back to the 'present' of 54 CE, from which point the temporal scheme settles into a more regular modulation. TWTNW also makes use of analepsis. The opening chapter analeptically foregrounds the meeting, in Paris in 1908, at which Evno Azef, the anarchist mastermind, is exposed as a double agent and provocateur. Later in the book, in its correct chronological position, this will be the moment when the many tangled narratives converge. 'When they imagined they were mounting a challenge to state power,' Gray writes in his review, 'the anarchists were wandering in a hall of mirrors.' (Anon, 1983) In fathoming Azef, an undeniable avatar of terroristic violence, the more thoughtful leaders of the movement, who have invested their hope in his promises, are forced to confront their own reflection. The opening chapter concludes with the focus on Kropotkin who, prompted by the disorientating revelations about Azef, recollects his friend Elisée Reclus. Through a double narrative sleight of hand (using the fictional device of free indirect discourse), the reader is taken back half a century to the beginning of the story in 1870, and Reclus' point of view of Paris under siege. (Anon, 1985) 'Had his cerebral, reticent old friend really been one of those fearless men who floated aloft in balloons, braving the Prussian sharpshooters?' Kropotkin muses. 'It mattered so much from where you saw things, and what you wanted to see. For fiction could so easily be confused with truth, and truth relegated to the realm of fiction.' (Anon, 1972) It is an explicit statement of the book's philosophy, articulated as the insight of one its main protagonists, and as such is itself a clue to other strategies that the book will adopt to achieve its objectives. This opening chapter establishes Paris as a space that exists across time, the fulcrum of anarchist ambitions since the Commune of 1871, memories of which lie suppressed beneath the glittering but unstable ground of the Belle Époque. It also identifies a number of key individuals who the reader will next encounter in their earlier youth then follow through life, and maps the relationships that will develop between them. Like Pompeii, though, it leaves hanging at its end a crucial question. In this case: just how did thwarted plans render hope into something so tenuous that it was close to despair? The opening Azef chapter is followed, immediately, by two other chapters located in Paris and set during the siege and Commune: the events that Kropotkin has been pondering. The movement in time and space, the shift in their chronotopic configuration between chapters, is mediated by the implied interiority of an individual historical figure. It is a principle of narrative focalisation through the subjectivities of character that these two chapters will elaborate, most notably with the aim of further highlighting themes of perspective, communication and the imaginary, and the risk of their subversion and manipulation. Considered in the light of Bakhtinian theory, on which I drew more or less consciously throughout the planning and writing of TWTNW, the book's narrative may be thought of as structured around a series of actual, imagined or projected chronotopic crises. Both the siege of Paris in 1870 and the Commune of early 1871 conform to this notion through their spatial inversions: power surrounding, in the form of a besieging army, rather than within; the dispossessed poor of the urban margins reoccupying the elite spaces of the centre in a moment that was both revolutionary and carnivalesque. (Anon, 1989) The Commune is, too, the origin of multiple spatio-temporal crises, at varied scale, individual and collective, that will haunt the following decades. These are experienced most frequently in the lives of people deracinated through exile, flight or imprisonment, obliged to reformulate the chronotopes of their everyday existence, but also in terms of the lost heterotopia of the Commune that they aspire to recover. (Anon, n.d.) The explosive rupture of time and space through the 'propaganda by deed' of terroristic bombs appears to offer the means to achieve the overthrow of institutions to which anarchism aspires. One of the most crucial moments of chronotopic crisis in the book (and the one at the origins of its conception) is the attempted bombing in 1894 of the Greenwich Meridian, the space from where time is controlled, at a moment when the control of working time is a point of intense political contention. (Anon, n.d.) That failed act of violence, examined in the context of others that were near contemporaneous, appears likely to have been a consequence of dissimulation, as was its reception: a misreading of signal and noise, a failure to separate the actual from the fictional. It is a recurrent theme, first established through the metaphorical account of signal stations, balloonists and 'sympathetic snails' by which those besieged in Paris sought to communicate with those outside the city in 1870. Through the use of cinematic effect, of rapid cuts and crash-zooms that Kracauer might have appreciated, my account of those events itself seeks to prime the reader to the book's frequent shifts in perspective and scale, eliding the personal, microcosmic and macrocosmic. (Guldi, 1983) Pompeii too had been structured around a focal moment of chronotopic crisis, one that is more literal than that of envisaged anarchist catastrophe, and whose spatial disruption is more persistent than that wrought by the Commune. The devastating earthquake probably struck in 62 CE (possibly a year later) but its precise moment in ritual time and space is inscribed on an altar frieze that depicts toppling temples and alarmed sacrificial animals: the festival of Augustus on 5 th February. Chapter 7 concentrates the fractured experience of these events in time and space through two vignettes, separated by little more than a page. The earthquake devastated the city. Recent archaeological surveys have revealed the extent of its effects by tracing rebuilding, change of building use and ownership, or abandonment. The years of recovery coincided with wider social turbulence, during the latter years of Nero's reign, when personal cults of the emperor and nepotism disrupted the social order. There was then a year of civil war and the seizure of the imperial throne by the Flavian dynasty. My diachronic modelling of the Pompeiian storyworld, from which the fictionalized narrative was derived, included the hypothesis that the earthquake weakened the traditional power structures in the city and amplified the potential for social fluidity in its aftermath. The functions of civic buildings were radically altered; prestige properties, markers of wealth and influence, changed hands between the magisterial and freedman classes; damaged infrastructure reshaped the urban topography. During this prolonged chronotopic crisis, the established order of space-time relationships became friable, both physically and narratively. The impact of the earthquake was reflected in the responses to it of the characters, the changes in their fortunes and relationships observed in the vignettes. The question of the authenticity or reliability of the text in Pompeii became most contentious as a result of my decision that the relationship between speculation and analysis, encoded in the different textures of the chapters, should itself evolve over the course of the book, with the chronotopic crisis of the earthquake as a point of transformation. Outright speculation in the vignettes had begun to bleed into the discursive sections from early on, establishing useful talking points for analysis, as with the stated assumptions about the modesty of Julius Polybius's house already in Chapter 3: 'Polybius himself was content to project a more steady and civic-minded persona', which occurs in non-italicised text, based on the historical figure's discernible profile. (Anon, n.d.) Within the scheme established within the book, I believe that this was legitimate and effective for some readers in deepening critical imaginative engagement. By the book's mid-point, I was confident that readers would have internalised the book's principle of speculative construction, and they would have been transformed into Eco's ideal 'second level' model reader, critically attuned to the textual forest that they were navigating. (Anon, 2002) Following the earthquake chapter, I therefore allowed the authorial voice to become less tentative, and the distinction drawn between modes of narrative more porous. The syntax of the text consciously shifted too, with less conditionality, more assertion. However, in describing a possible visit to the city by Nero, I failed to find the appropriate strategy for presenting this element of the narrative as intriguing conjecture rather than established fact. (Anon, 1980) Invested as I was in the speculative logic of the storyworld, persuaded by certain recent discoveries of circumstantial evidence, eager for a scenario that would allow the exploration of certain thematic issues, I surmised a high probability that such a visit occurred. I justified this incaution to myself on the basis that the damnatio memoriae pronounced on Nero after his fall, which saw the official erasure of any record of his rule, would have removed the evidence. This decision offered a hostage to fortune. Despite lambasting the book for its credulity of the imperial historical sources, Beard saw further error in this deviation from their record. (Ricoeur, 1984) Her review, the first published, appeared a point of reference for later reviewers, such as Ben Jarman who wrote, 'The problem is, according to some historians, that there is no firm evidence that Nero ever visited Pompeii'. (Anon, n.d.) Others seemed to see the Beard review as requiring redress, with Jones explaining how the postulated visit enabled the book to interrogate the configurations of behaviour that it would have engendered. (Anon, n.d.) Jones wrote of Ray Laurence and my speculation regarding the feast that may have been staged for Nero, had he visited Pompeii: 'They do so on the reasonable assumption that anyone entertaining an emperor would want to know his tastes. So they present the possible evidence for that -violent sex on the one hand, high Greek culture on the otherand prompt us to make our own judgement.' (Anon, n.d.) The last point is key. The mode is generous and non-didactic. However, in this case I had clumsily overstepped the negotiable line between fact and imagination that I had so carefully established. The paratextual or epitextual aspects of the books -titles, covers, illustrations, apparatus -may prime and enable appropriate reader strategies. This is particularly important in the case of books such as these, which pursue innovative or unfamiliar approaches to their subject matter but within forms that appear superficially conventional. The reader's response to the paratextual signals may have a profound influence on their experience of the text and, where this experienced is shared through epitextual mechanisms, can establish expectations more broadly. (Anon, n.d.) The title Pompeii: The Living City clearly signalled the book's focus on a period before the eruption, implying some level of reconstruction. More problematically ambiguous was the cover design commissioned by the publisher for the UK hardback. Its style was unexpected to me, and not entirely welcome, but the image made sense as a creative response to the brief. A central scene of triclinium dining was posed in direct emulation of the Roman wall painting behind it, itself taken from the House of the Chaste Lovers in Pompeii. It encoded both allusion to how the book drew on the material evidence of the ruins to recreate everyday life, and the double coding with which it challenges readers. The requirement to decipher the image, however, may have been misjudged. For some reviewers it simply carried unfortunate genre associations, with Nick West suggesting that something 'less Massimo Manfredi [author of 'swords and sandals' genre fiction] and more Robert Graves would do greater justice to the quality of the work by the authors'. (Anon, n.d.) For Beard, however, it offered 'worrying signs from the outset' in its depiction of 'of an implausibly luxurious Pompeian dinner party that is obviously soon to degenerate into a bone fide orgy.' 49 For a scholar of classical art, familiar with Pompeii, this was a curiously obtuse misreading but provided a convenient foundation for her subsequent attacks on the plausibility of the work as a whole. Choosing to ignore every signal of the distinct mode of historical representation that the book proposed, in the cover and elsewhere, Beard's review rehearsed in full an assessment of it as a straightforward scholarly study and included specific criticisms that were valid in these terms (and a couple more generally). It implicitly invoked academic seniority to debunk well-grounded speculative interpretations, for being speculative. That few others made this error may suggest some effective paratextual priming of those readers with more open minds. In the case of the later book, the main title, The World That Never Was, encapsulated three ideas at the heart of the book, whose interplay the reader was invited to consider. It alluded to the utopian future world to which the anarchist revolutionaries aspired (the earlier planned title was The Map of Utopia), the imagined world of global conspiracies that the political police sought promulgate to alarmist effect, and the vast model of the globe that Reclus planned to build to encourage a sense of international brotherhood in those who visited it. This was intended to answer a constant problem of definition posed by the book, since the obvious hook of 'anarchism' allowed too easy and erroneous a categorisation. (Anon, n.d.) Agents with care, aware that it must clarify the cryptic main title. However, like the Pompeii cover, its intended effect was occasionally, and frustratingly, misunderstood or ignored. (Anon, n.d.) The listing of four categories of protagonist both indicated that it was a biographically-based history, and subverted the notion of a straightforward survey of anarchism. The 'anarchists' in the account would be placed in relationship with other groups characterised by their unreliability or heightened subjectivity. The ironic over- Whilst acknowledging other factors that influenced the more negative reviewsincluding occasional unease about factual accuracy in Pompeii, and writing style in TWTNW -the extremes of opinion seem to me to reflect a more fundamental distinction between readers. Those most sympathetic and responsive to the aims of the books to engage readers in a more dialogic than authoritative mode were written either by general readers, or by writers who had themselves grappled with the challenges of distilling complex ideas into accessible narrative form. In the case of Pompeii, these included educators and novelists; for The World That Never Was, political essayists, journalists and biographers. Examples are: Gray's consideration of TWTNW as 'one of the most absorbing depictions of the dark underside of radical politics in many years' that succeeds in being 'exceptionally astute' while offering a 'riveting account'; Hughes-Hallett's insightful observations that the 'ingenious narrative is not a line but a net ... there are myriad intersections, cords going off across continents or into the past', Miller's that 'as the author of political history, Butterworth strikes a rare balance; he doesn't flinch from moral judgement, but he's not about to succumb to the propagandizing instinct himself', or Preston's who saw that it 'set the reader free to think for himself'. (Anon, n.d.) Jones, Jane Gardam, Hughes, Paterson, and Stevenson, among others, similarly appreciated Pompeii, each informatively but with different emphases. (Anon, n.d.) The more negative reviews often entailed mistaken assumptions about the fixed persona of the author-narrator. Whereas Miller had recognised that the author of TWTNW 'wasn't an idealist himself and has a taste for gossipy details', Leo McKinstry was not alone in perceiving an authorial ideologue whose book had a great 'failing: the moral viewpoint'; the International Socialist Review too read ventriloquism as endorsement, the book itself being 'overtly hostile to Marxism and Leninism ... rehashing the trite misrepresentation of their debates'. (Anon, n.d.) By contrast, in noting that the author 'reckons' that 'Dostoevsky's alarmist representation of The Possessed ... provided insidious encouragement to Tsarist repression', I would like to think that Hughes-Hallett suspected that such a reductive reading of a masterpiece of literary polyphony was, in the context of the book's own approach, an ironic impersonation of partisanship. (Anon, n.d.) Many of these assumptions suggest that, for some readers, expectations of literalism, authority and stability within a text of historical narrative -of the 'magisterial authority' that publishers often demand that 'trade' historians impersonate -had been insufficiently disrupted. Hostility to TWTNW was greatest from those with a confirmed ideological stance of their own, whether from left or right (in the US, anarchist and libertarian views were sometimes hard to differentiate). The greatest criticisms of Pompeii came from classical historians and archaeologists with an academic background, although these were balanced by the enthusiasm of others with a similar position. In the two most notable cases of hostility, Beard and Ling, the reviewers had either recently published or were preparing books on the same subject, had expert knowledge but may have felt some emotional and intellectual ownership. Their rejection of my strategies in Pompeii nevertheless illuminated our divergent approaches to the challenges presented. Wiseman, in his review, accepted that 'we need the novelist's imagination, but also the scholarly caution that recognises how fragile our inferences are. New evidence usually brings new puzzles, to remind us that we always know less than we think'. (Anon, n.d.) This paraphrased my statement of caution in the book's 'Introduction', yet he concluded that, as authors, Ray Lawrence and I 'did not aspire to the sophisticated irony with which Keith Hopkins conveyed how provisional all knowledge about the distant past must be' in his A World Full of Gods. (Anon, n.d.) Hopkins had used the device of two time-travelling students to the ancient city who were confronted with the unknowable nature of its ancient culture, with the author scolded for the foolishness of his fanciful experimentation in a letter from 'Mary Beard', an imagined version of a Cambridge colleague. (Anon, n.d.) Hopkins' work explored the conventions within which some academic historians require historical authority to be performed, in written form, and their reluctance to entertain the validity of a more open and speculative mode of enquiry, with selectivity inevitably causing distortion. I had intended that Pompeii and TWTNW should successfully advance a more sophisticated way of addressing provisional and partial knowledge, eschewing the obvious irony of an overtly postmodern form such as that used by Hopkins in favour of other, more nuanced strategies. Rather than tell readers that the historical record was unreliable, and rendered more so through the fact of its written presentation, the books would rehearse that inevitable unreliability for them, through examples of possible narrative construction. They would present 'open texts' where the critical imagination of the reader met that of the author, and where it was trusted and enabled, not to passively assimilate knowledge or reach any 'correct' conclusion but to exercise itself on uncertainty. The published response of readers leads me to conclude that, in this, the books were partially successful for a significant proportion of readers, but that others require at least a backstop of certainty. It is tempting to imagine that a presentation of the content of either book in a dynamic digital form would obviate their concerns. The books self-consciously inhabit a space full of possible narratives, but can only lead the reader on a single trace through that reconfigurable matrix. 'Caveat Lector' was how Beard concluded her review: 'reader beware'. (Anon, n.d.) In doing so she inadvertently articulated the warning implicit throughout both texts: beware that there are other ways that this account might be presented, whether as a more compelling story that took far greater license, or through a more exclusive focus on cautiously balanced analysis. A digital rendering might provide the means to verify facts, retrace the author's steps, cross-reference, test 'rash conjectures', and explore alternatives. (Anon, n.d.) Degrees of reliability and conditional qualifiers can be assigned to contemporary accounts, the many possible interpretations of an artefact or inscription could be constellated in relation to contextual data. In this ideal medium and form, compelling immersion in historical narrative would inculcate scholarly scepticism. It would also allow mnemonic aids for readers who struggled with the proliferation of names, with an illustrated and summarized Dramatis Personae and multi-dimensional timelines constantly accessible. (Anon, n.d.) The most satisfying, and reassuring, response to Pompeii that I have encountered among readers has been from doctoral and postdoctoral classicists and archaeologists, for two of whom it was their first book-length encounter with the ancient world. Each of them, interestingly, is now specialising in digital methods of spatial and temporal investigation. Perhaps one day soon, if I do not, one of them will create a system that will allow users to explore alternative explanations for how the signet ring fell behind the cupboard, and conjure the other narratives that the answers might suggest. discovery are disquieting. In the near future, procedurally generated, responsive narratives will raise even more urgent questions about the information and ideas they serve us or deny us. The question of whose agenda is served by the mediated storyworlds in which we are immersed will become a pressing concern. Our sense of algorithmically augmented agency -of owning the elaborate narratives that we inhabit -will carry a persuasive charge, but will it lead to an experience of the world that is sceptical and selfreflexive, or credulous and delusional? The writing of history, including those narratives woven out of the Big Now enabled by the instantaneity of access to vastly broad and deep data, may become a key area of contention. By embracing the challenges of narrative, Digital History, with its deep lineage in radical and communitarian social engagement, may find a relevance that extends far beyond the academy. playful intertextuality to hint at or expose additional dimensions to their narrative. The novels of Italo Calvino, John Fowles, Carlos Fuentes, Thomas Pynchon, and Jeanette Winterson, Dennis Potter's television plays, and Peter Greenaway's films, for example, all appealed to me, at the time, for their exploration of temporal instability and affinities across time, and for how they engaged the reader in a more active kind of narrative decryption. My novel Merciless assembled a prismatic narrative, constructed around an Edwardian archaeologist's erroneous idealisation of the lost Minoan civilization, and the devastating impact on contemporary and future lives that resulted. It interwove six time frames, across three thousand years, and explored echoes of Edwardian geopolitics in the late twentieth century, specifically around internecine war in the Balkans, tracing parallels that resonated through a complex system of motifs. However, in my naive ambition to test and stretch the possibilities that historiographical metafiction afforded, I soon ran up against what seemed to me the limits of the sub-genre, at least in analogue form. This prompted me to begin my exploration of interactive narrative. A couple of years earlier, I had first encountered the possibilities of hypertext fiction through Detlev Fischer, the author of Schwamm ('Sponge'), a prototype graphic novel written in Hypercard to be viewed on the screen of an old Macintosh II. (Anon, n.d.) Navigating from card to card, each filled with collages of text and Ascii illustrations, I had found the experience opaque but mesmerising. At around the same time, the author Robert Coover had alerted readers of the New York Times Book Review to the transformative potential of hypertext. 'Fluidity, contingency, indeterminacy, plurality, discontinuity are the hypertext buzzwords of the day,' he wrote, 'and they seem to be fast becoming principles, in the same way that relativity not so long ago displaced the falling apple.' (Anon, n.d.) The principles of hypertext have since become familiar through the hot linking between pages across the world wide web that subvert boundaries and hierarchies, and have indeed transformed reading culture. However, Coover's epiphanic excitement concerned the potential of hypertext to empower individual creators of narrative rather than as a medium of collective expression. For Coover, hypertext promised 'a new kind of fiction, and a new kind of reading', while literary and art critic George Landow saw in it 'an almost embarrassingly literal reification or actualisation' of contemporary literary theory. (Anon, n.d.) A medium that could liberate narrative possibilities that analogue media had stunted or contorted was an intoxicating prospect. 'The form of the text is rhythmic,' Coover enthused, 'looping on itself in patterns and layers that gradually accrete meaning, just as the passage of time does in one's lifetime.' While working on Merciless, I had diagrammed the complex structure of the novel across multiple wall charts. The conception of narrative that this revealed -as a matrix of stories, themes and tropes, all in relationships of consonance with or counterpoint to one another -surely demanded a hypertext form. I drew encouragement for my move towards digital forms from Landow's claim that, 'Most poststructuralists write from within the twilight of the wished-for coming day; most writers of hypertext write of many of the same things from within the dawn'. (Anon, n.d.) I was particularly influenced in my early exploration of interactive forms of narrative by two works by Umberto Eco: The Open Work, from which I drew a foundational understanding of the hermeneutic relationship, and The Limits of Interpretation, which led me towards more intricate theories of narratology, in both cases for how they might be applied to digital forms. 8 I saw Eco's work as advancing Barthes' reconceptualisation of the relative importance of author and reader in 'making a text happen', by recognising that, 'a text is a lazy machinery which forces its possible readers to do a part of its textual work, but the modalities of the interpretive operations -albeit multiple, and possibly infinite -are by no means indefinite and must be recognised as imposed by the semiotic strategies displayed by the text'. (Anon, n.d.) In other ways, he explicitly posed 'the more formidable question of the recognition of the reader's response as a possibility built into the textual strategy'. However, the text Eco envisioned was that of the book (or possibly a film), whose structural complexity, since pre-determined, is 'necessarily finite', while the principle of infinite interpretative variation is a function of 'the artifice of its composition'. (Anon, n.d.) As I began to work with hypertext, I quickly realised that insofar as it reified the hermeneutic process, rather than merely structurally mirroring its theorisation, it did so crudely. A user or reader who expresses an interpretive strategy by means of navigating through a network of pages and links, or nodes and edges, may experience a sense of agency. Yet however complex the underlying narrative network, it remains static, uninflected by their response to the text. The reader's experience is that of the flâneur, at best, though more often of the idle browser who is, necessarily, at least half-blind to the consequences of the choices they make when selecting their route. For where a reader is allowed to preview steps along a possible path, this unavoidably subverts the narrative effects that derive from anticipation and the testing of hypothecations of the consequent narrative logic. The loss of authorial artifice in what has become known as 'ergodic literature' invites certain obvious solutions but these are often inherently problematic. Espen Aarseth defined 'ergodic' in 1997 according to the criterion that 'nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text', (according to this principle, reading Finnegan's Wake is trivial, while link-clicking on web clickbait is not). (Anon, n.d.) A more productive understanding of the nature of the interpretative choices that the reader of such work expresses through their navigation of the text is to be found in Marie-Laure Ryan's claim in 2006 that 'external/exploratory interactivity … promotes a metafictional stance, at the expense of immersion in the virtual world' of the electronic text. (Anon, n.d.) This points towards a particular kind of experience in which the 'reader' may take a more active, constructive role that is critical, detached and strategic but also consequential. However, by assuming 'an external perspective on the worlds of the textual universe' the reader not only loses the experience of immersion, but finds themselves in a paradoxical relationship with narratorial authority. (Anon, n.d.) As Ruth Aylett and Sandy Louchart explain, 'On the one hand the author seeks control over the direction of a narrative in order to give it a satisfactory structure. On the other hand a participating user demands the autonomy to act and react without explicit authorial constraint.' (Anon, n.d.) Closely related to the challenge of maintaining the immersion of the strategically reflective user in the narrative that they are constructing is the inherent resistance of hypertextual narrative to closure, which Coover had predicted would 'be a major theme for narrative artists of the future'. (Anon, n.d.) Far from limiting a reader's interpretive agency, narrative closure is, in fact, a necessary element of any strategy that ensures the openness of the text. Both as a kairotic moment in which the ideal reader's construction of the text is realised and meaning is integrated, and as the point to which her imaginative efforts are directed, it is the keystone of that 'artifice of its composition' which the author has architected. and complex is the initial understanding needed. In a series of pioneering projects in the years either side of the millenium, I experimented with how authorial expertise might be invested in software systems to generate and manage emergent narrative experiences within digitally mediated environments. These began with Meantime, my MA graduation project, a screen-based interactive chamber drama, and included Ages of Avatar, for which I explored the dramaturgical use of improvisational scenarios in virtual worlds. (Anon, n.d.) The culmination of this phase of my work was the Gnosis story engine that I designed for the German company eMedia, as the foundation for a series of planned console games, of which the first, Extinct, involved a narrative set in early thirteenth-century Magdeburg. No commercial project using Gnosis was completed or released, and my investigation of the subject was poorly documented, in part because of contractual restraints. However, my work predicted much theoretical discussion of interactive narrative that has been published by others in the decade and a half since (to which, where relevant, I defer). The narrative experience generated by Gnosis does not rest on an underlying text that could be defined in advance in static form, but rather emerges from the interplay of the user's actions and a conceptual model of a world of 'narrativity' in which all elements have an independent, dynamic existence. My design of Gnosis was grounded in the concept of the 'storyworld', which Paul Herman has since summarised as 'the overall fictional ontology described within a narrative text'. (Anon, n.d.) Herman further explains that, 'Interpreters of narrative do not merely reconstruct a series of events and a set of existents but imaginatively (emotionally, viscerally) inhabit a world.' (Anon, 1994) The creator of narratives for such emergent interactive forms can be thought of as designing the terms on which the user encounters the storyworld, and the way in which it responds to that encounter. Within the Gnosis engine, the constituent elements of this 'storyworld' were described as entities within a complex, relational data structure, which I termed the 'storyworld ontology'. With rules set to govern how these entities interacted with one another, according to their individual affordances, an ecological system of autonomous agents was established. The complex behaviour of these agents then generated events that provided material for selection and presentation as a narrative, which could be manifest in a range of styles (textual, graphical, isometric, 2D, etc). The participant's role within the storyworld was equivalent to that of another agent, but one with enhanced capabilities and understanding who could intentionally alter the state of the agent-ecology by influencing elements within it. The participant's primary objective, therefore, was to observe and understand the rules and attributes of the storyworld in order to effect the consequences as they wished, and so shape the narrative that emerged. Within this 'playable story' they needed to learn to 'play the system'. In practice, the emergence demonstrated by a complex system tends to resolve to equilibrium over time. To ensure narrative coherence, sustained activity and meaningful closure it was therefore necessary to impose constraints on the ecology. This was achieved by interposing moments where the state of the ecology could be reviewed, and limits set on which aspects were available for the user to further explore. These points of review and reconfiguration marked, in effect, breaks between episodes or chapters, in which the potential content of the next episode or chapter was determined. For a narrative represented in a three-dimensional virtual environment, such as the console games that the Gnosis engine was designed to control, these episodes or 'levels' would take the form of specific, procedurally generated configurations of space-time within the larger world of the story. In conceiving of this approach, I was influenced by Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of the 'chronotope', a highly flexible conceptual tool devised to describe 'the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature'. In this fusion, 'time, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history.' (Anon, n.d.) For Bakhtin, the chronotope is tantamount to the spatio-temporal construction that underlies every narrative text, 'the place where the knots of narrative are tied and untied' and events become concrete. The particular chronotopic configuration of narrative space-time defines a work's literary genre, and a text is read in relation to the chronotopic expectations it creates. Bakhtin's theory has been very variously interpreted, applied and refined, with many types of chronotope proposed for different purposes. Most relevant to my application of the concept here is what Bart Keunen has recently termed the 'dialogical chronotope': that of a narrative that 'is not directed towards a final moment, to a \"telos\", but rather consists of a network of conflicting situations and junctions that communicate with each other.' (Anon, n.d.) The chronotopic configuration of time, space and associated actors generated by Gnosis for each 'level' might be imagined as a series of rooms at a certain date and time, according to which the space would be populated by characters and objects with particular needs and propensities, and organised to have certain doors locked and certain others open. As in a Commedia dell'arte scenario, improvisatory actors, both animate and inanimate (a door, here, is an 'actor'), would be equipped with a loosely defined scenario, behavioural tendencies and stock information according to which they would interact with the participant. (Anon, n.d.) The narrative would 'thicken', in Bakhtin's terms, around the participant's interaction with the space of the storyworld 'level' and its contents, through the sequential events enacted until a satisfactory point of provisional closure was reached. The immediate objective for the player was to learn about, understand and influence the storyworld towards effecting the final condition of its microcosmic society. Through observation of the characters and objects in a 'level', the participant might gain information about the storyworld, while judicial interaction with them might achieve small consequences which would ramify through the storyworld, prior to the next point of review and reconfiguration. Insights into the social structure of the storyworld, its hierarchies of power, networks of trade and patronage, domestic and conspiratorial relationships might all be examples of useful knowledge to acquire. However, just as the participant would formulate their understanding of the storyworld and establish objectives within it, so other Non Player Characters (NPCs) would hold their own 'mental' model of the storyworld, and plans that they would attempt to fulfill (but about which they might dissimulate). In order to decide how to influence the NPCs effectively, the player needed to understand their individual subjectivities. In designing a system to manage this, I drew on the theory of Possible Worlds then being developed by Marie-Laure Ryan, Ludomir Dolozel and Thomas Pavel from its origins in formal logic, to provide what Herman has called a 'conceptual framework for considering the relationship between fictionality and the semantics of narrative'. In Dolozel's terms, the semantics of narrative concern the ENDNOTES Introduction (Anon, n.d.)

    "title": "Towards a Theory of Roman Urbanism: Beyond Economics and Ideal-Types",
    "abstract": "",
    "full_text": "In a recent article C. R. Whittaker asked the question, ' Do theories ofthe ancient city matter? (Anon, n.d.). The question is certainly reasonable and was prompted by the confusion that currently pervades the study of ancient urbanism as to which of the myri ad of theories produced to explain it is the best. As is now well known, the current turmoil stems from (Finley, 1977) assertion that ancient and modern forms of urbanism were qualitatively different. To highlight the distinction between them, Finley adopted the Weberian opposition between the 'producer' and the 'consumer ' city. The producer city derives its living through econom ic production and enterprise and is deemed to be characteristic of European urbani sm from the Medieval period onwards, However, in the ancient world, the city was instead a 'consumer' of rural surpluses, which it extracted directly from the countryside through having a legal claim to them, Finley arg ued that Weber 's 'consumer city' ideal -type better explained the economic function of the ancient city than the 'modernising' perspective advocated by scholars such as Rostovtzeff. Even so, the 'consumer city' model is not without its difficulties. The most notable of these is the view that commodity production was largel y irrelevant to ancient urbanism, In opposing this premise a number of sc holars have pointed to the archaeological eviden ce, especially that found in Roman c ities, for ancient urban production, For instance, (Pucci et al., 1983) and (Morel, 1981) have show n that, beginning in the second century Be, an increase in the production of fine Italian pottery for export coincided with a major phase of urban development. Similarly, others have discussed the social and political importance of ' urban industries ' and urban-based commercial activities (e,g. (Andreae, 1974)(Anon, 1976); although now see (Jongman, 1988)(Anon, 1974), In light of this research, it is more difficult to argue that production and commerce were not significant to the ancient urban economy, As a consequence of this, a debate has ensued as to whether the consumer city model is perhaps not too pessimistic about the level of economic activity in ancient cities. As part of thi s debate a number of alternatives have been proposed that are supposed to agree more readily with the evidence, Amongst these are (Anon, 1990) 'service city' model, Hopkins (Anon, n.d.) view of the city as a 'processor' of rural surpluses and the concept advocated by Leveau, Goudineau and Wacher of the city as 'organi ser' of the country side (Leveau & Goudineau, 1983)(Anon, 1974)). These theories have been recently debated at some length (Anon, n.d.)(Whittaker, 1990)(Anon, 1995)) and wi II not be pursued further here. The important point is that there are specific problems with each of them and hence the confusion noted at the outset. Nevertheless, Whittaker still maintains that the ' consumer city' model is preferable to any of the alternatives, whatever difficulties there mi ght be with it. This though is hardly satisfactory and has even prompted some to consider whether it is in fact better to disregard urban theory altogether (e.g. Rihill & Wilson) 991). However, this position can hardly be construed as adequate either. So, how should we proceed? We can begin by noting that a peculiarity of the contemporary debate is that categories such as 'consumer city' and ' producer city' were developed by nineteenth and early twentieth century sociology to explain the economic function of the city rather than to produce a general theory of the c ity itself. The concern of sociologists was to account for the rise of capitalism and Whittaker reminds us that Weber's distinction between the 'consumer' and 'producer' cities needs to be understood as relating to this issue (Anon, n.d.). If so, what has transpired is that a theory that seeks to understand the economic function of a city, has been habitually taken for a theory of the city itself. It follows that we can therefore criticise 'economic' theories of the ancient city because they do not offer us a theory of the city itself, they only provide a way of understanding its economic function. But, why should this be a problem ? Surely the city's function defines its nature? However, we run into difficulty with this kind of reasoning if we ask how the economic function of the ancient city was related to its existence as a physical entity composed of streets, buildings and houses. Itis actually extremely difficult to beg in with any economic theory of the ancient city and then use it to explain its physical structure. In the case of Roman urbanism, it is difficult to understand from the variou s models why it took the form it did. For instance, using the 'consumer city' model , how do we explain the grid pattern of streets characteristic of most Roman cities? Was it really necessary for the streets to be laid out in this way for the city to extract rural surpluses? These questions cannot be answered by reference to the ideal-type, because such models divorce function from form, with the result that 'the city' is nothing more than an abstract concept without any reference to physical reality. An objection to this criticism might be that the physical structure of the city is primarily a 'cultural' and not an 'economic' phenomenon. Hence the failure of economic models to explain the physical form of the ancient city is not problematic because physical form is not related to economic function . If such a line of reasoning were to be pursued, it would soon run into a logical difficulty. This is that economic theories of ancient urbanism conceptualise the urban form as the location for economic activity rather than as the au/come of that activity. Studies of economic activity in Roman cities have habitually focused on the manufacture and exchange of 'commodities' such as pottery, metalwork and textiles . Yet objects usually seen to be 'cultural': wall-paintings, mosaics, sculpture, engraved gems , jewellery, bronze and silverware tableware are also the end products of productive processes. Why then are these not also seen as 'evidence' for economic activity? Furthermore, following this line of reasoning, the very fabric of the city itself: its streets and buildings must also have been the outcome of economic activity. From this point of view, the test of any economic theory must be whether it can account for these physical features, and so the above criticism still holds. If the entire city was the product of economic activity, it follows that it mu st have been the coll ective outcome of the actions of a large number of individuals and this raises another problem with economic models of ancient urbanism, namely, that they deny human agency. The concept of human agency is central to the social theory advocated by Anthony (Anon, 1979)(Anon, 1981)(Anon, 1984) and so it is worth pausing to consider what the term ' agency' actually means . According to Giddens, one of the central problems with social theory as it was developed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was that human beings were often viewed as 'cultural dopes', simply acting out 'roles ' prescribed for them by society. Instead , Giddens has argued that human beings are knowledgeable about the conditions in which they live and are able to act creatively, in relation to their own in-terests, to transform those conditions if necessary. Human beings are therefore 'agents' because they are capable of 'producing effects' even if those effects are not wholly intended. Ideal-types are too mechanistic to permit agency since they assume that all individuals behaved in such a way so as to produce the effects predicted by the model. They do not allow for the fact that there may have been those who did not behave according to the underlying economic rationale of the model. In addition, economic models do not explain what motivated individuals to behave in the way described by them, nor do they explain how individuals came to learn the appropriate behaviours in the first place. Instead, the creative actions of individuals are simply subsumed into the prescriptions of the model with the effect that we lose sight of them. Indeed, according to the economic models it is 'the city' that 'consumed,' 'provided services,' 'processed' or 'organised' and not the individuals who lived within it. However, urbanism is obviously a human creation. It can only exist, in and through, the actions of individuals. To deny human agency is clearly unsatisfactory and not just for the reasons discussed. There is an even more fundamental problem with ideal-types in that they do not address the question of why it is that human beings created urban environments in the first place. We know that societies can function without it and economic theories neither account for why ancient society needed cities, nor what effect cities had on society. Yet, there must have been a relationship between the urban form and society, and this is obviously what we need to understand. These criticisms of the use of ideal-types account for the difficulty in employing them effectively to explain the ancient city. However, to react against theory altogether is simply not plausible either. The argument here is that the problem is not in the use of theory, but rather thekindof theory that has been employed . This paper seeks to address the problems with theories of ancient urbanism by exploring an alternative theory of the city which draws on contemporary sociology, rather than economics . The focus here will be on understanding Roman urbanism specifically, although the general theory outlined below should be applicable to urbanism everywhere. Part of the problem of understanding ancient urbanism is that the wrong question has been asked at the outset. The question of how the ancient city functioned in the economy notably neglects , but also depends on, the more fundamental question of: 'What is urbanism?'. Indeed, as Laurence has recently pointed out, the debate around the Weberian model of the 'consumer city' has been based on agreement or disagreement with the propositions of the argument; no theoretical debate about the nature of urbanism has been forthcoming (Anon, n.d.). In fact, scholars have consistently ignored the writings of urban sociologists with the effect that criticisms levelled at Weber's work by them have gone largely unnoticed (e.g. (Anon, n.d.). This might be due to the misguided belief that because the ancient city is not I ike the modern city, the thoughts of urban sociology are largely in•elevant to understanding it. This argument is, of course, circular because it depends on accepting at the outset that the two are qualitatively different. However, what is it that makes both ancient and modern urbanism 'urban' in the first place? We can begin with the fact that the city is a physical entity irrespective of whether it is ancient or modern. It is one aspect of the created environment both past and present. This observation raises the questions of, ' created by whom?' and 'for what purpose?'. The urban theorists David (Anon, 1973)(Anon, n.d.) have answered these questions by arguing that the city is produced by, and for, the society that inhabits it. This idea has its origins in Henri Lefebvre's (1991) seminal work The Production of Space in which abstract, social space and concrete material space were connected for the first time. For Lefebvre urbanism was a process whereby spatial forms were produced and transformed by society. A town or city is inhabited by a socially differentiated population with conflicting attitudes and interests. Social discord can neither be avoided, nor resolved by mobility, since everyone inhabits the 'same space'. The only solution is to manipulate the physical fabric of the urban form in order to try to resolve tensions . Consequently, the urban form reflects and embodies the conflicts inherent in society. What characterises urbanism, then, is the continual restructuring of space. This means that the urban form is not static, but instead exists in a dynamic relationship with the society that creates it. It follows, then, that to understand what a city is, we have to grasp the historically specific social processes through which spatial forms are created and transformed. This position obviously overcomes the above criticism of economic models of ancient urbanism in that the physical form of the city can be explained as a direct outcome of social and cultural processes. While it is certainly logical to suggest that the physical fabric of the city is the outcome of social and cultural processes, such a position is not entirely satisfactory. The difficulty with this approach is that the arrow of causality clearly points in one direction only : it is society that determines the use and thereby the form of space. This makes society a metaphysical, a priori, necessity that somehow 'creates' the city in its own image. If we were to leave matters here, we would be little better off than we were with economic theories of urbanism . While the city may very well be the 'product' of society, it is also the very place in which society comes into being and is transformed . An alternative tradition in urban sociology stresses this aspect of urbanism and sees it as more than just the coagulation of people and buildings. It has been argued that urbanism is also a 'way of life'. Louis Wirth (J 938) explores urbanism from this perspective and points out that urbanism is more than just a concentration of people, it creates a particular type of society. Individuals are brought into close proximity without necessarily being overly familiar with one another. Because most contacts between those who live in cities are generally fleeting, bonds between individuals tend to be much weaker than in smaller settlements. In addition, urban inhabitants tend to be more mobile: people are involved in a greater range of different activities and situations. The 'pace of life' is consequently' faster'. Wirth concluded that this made city life highly impersonal. However, Claude Fischer (1982) has reacted against this pessimisti c view of city life. In contrast to the habitual lament, which sees modern urbanism as having destroyed traditional communities, Fischer's research shows that large concentrations of people permit the formation of extensive social networks and institutions that simply could not have existed without the conditions created by urbanism. Urbanism, then, enables and supports a qualitatively different range of social relations to non-urban society. From this point of view, society is as much a product of urbanism as urbanism is the product of society. It seems therefore that urbanism is both a social process and a way of life at one and the same time. Do we have any grounds for uniting these two contrasting traditions in urban sociology? The answer is that we do in the shape of theories of practice, of which Giddens' (J 979, 1981, (984) social theory, mentioned earlier, is an example. The thrust of Giddens' theory is that although social institutions are the product of human action they are also simultaneously the medium for that action. Ifwe accept this, then it seems reasonable to argue that we can see urbanism as being both the location for, and the outcome of, human action. However, one problem with Giddens' theory is that it pays scant regard to the material conditions of existence and their importance in the construction and reproduction of social institutions (Barrett 1988:9). Indeed they appear to be created and sustained in an isotropic landscape, rather than in the material world. Nevertheless, Bourdieu's theory of practice does deal precisely with how the material world can be seen both as the objectification of social practices as well as the very medium within which they take place. Interestingly, from our point of view here, the house assumes a particular prominence in Bourdieu's writings. The physical structure of the house is seen by Bourdieu as the outcome of the application of classi ficatory schemes that dictate how space within the house is to be arranged. However, at the same time, through the physical separation of objects, persons and practices contained within it, the house continuously reinstalls those same schemes back into indi viduals (1977:89). Bourdieu's discussion of the house can be taken as a paradigm for the relationship between human action and architecture more generally. I have argued elsewhere in some detail (Anon, 1995) : I I -48) that the erection of an architectural boundary does more than just delimit an arena for activity, it effects 'who' is available to participate in that activity. It enables some individuals to be excluded while simultaneously including others. It is through differential patterns of inclusion and exclusion that social differences, and thereby inequalities (since difference necessarily implies inequality) are set up and sustained. Complex patterns of architectural boundaries produce spaces that are more readily accessible than others, creating greater or lesser opportunities to include and exclude. It is difficult to exclude from highly accessible spaces and to include in less accessible ones. This can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending upon whether one is seeking or trying to avoid social interaction. Nevertheless, individuals do have a certain degree of freedom to engage with, or avoid, social interaction by entering, or avoiding those spaces within which others are more likely to be found. It is this choice of association that underlies the features of urban life identified by Wirth and Fischer. On the other hand, the very rigidity and durability of architectural boundaries continually restrict the movement of individuals. Architecture also channels and directs movement, making individuals visible when they may not wish to be and invisible when perhaps they want contact with others. Architectural boundaries can thus be deployed as effective instruments of control. Indeed, this aspect of architecture is central to Foucault's thesis on the evolution of 'disciplinary' institutions (e.g. 1979). A city is consequently both a means to freedom as well as being an instrument of control at one and the same time. Indeed, this dualism has been seen as fundamental to understanding the built environment (Anon, 1993). A more intense pattern of architectural divisions allows individuals more freedom to negotiate their social identities and positions, but at the same time also controls their actions with greater efficacy. If spatial forms and human social action are so intimately intertwined, then it, follows that any transformation of those spatial forms, through the erection or demolition of boundaries, will necessarily effect how social interaction takes place. This may permit the formation of new social networks, while simultaneously curtailing others. Social networks are never equal, some individuals gain more out of them than others. Those who benefit from them therefore have a vested interest in maintaining and extending them. At this point the concept of agency becomes important. It is because humans are knowledgeable about the conditions of their existence that they will have an understanding -even if it is only at the intuitive, non-discursive, level-of how architectural boundaries help set up and maintain social inequalities. The manipulation of architectural boundaries is consequently a way of achieving social domination. Of course, spatial transformation can also be an instrument with which to resist domination. For instance, (Anon, 1977) has suggested that the formation of 'ghettos' in cities may not be an entirely negative phenomenon when considered as the act.ive use of space by individuals, who identify with one another, to assert. a collective identity. Since the city is simultaneously an instrument of domination and a mechanism for resistance, its physical fabric must be seen as the outcome of an on-going social discourse resulting in a continual 'pressure' to restructure space and this, as we saw above, is essential to the definition of urbanism . However, those wishing to restructure urban space do not always begin with a vacant site, but with pre-existing spatial forms that constrain what can be done, not just physically, but also socially as well. Because a physical transformation necessarily implies a social transformation, it cannot be enacted except through existing social networks. In other words, there may be considerable social resistance to any change and this may mean that the restructuring of space may be more limited than, or qualitatively different to, that desired. Furthermore, the restructuring of urban space can be seen to entail a certain 'risk', since it may have unforeseen and unintended outcomes that may result in a significant social restructuring, which, in turn, may generate pressure for a further restructuring of space. The thesis here is that urban form and urban society are locked together in a continuous, dynamic relationship . The urban form generates and supports a particular kind of society, while at the same time, this society continually struggles to realise itself in space by grinding against the physical constraints offered by the relative permanence of architectural boundaries. Urbanism, then, is not a universal 'object' about which we may have a 'theory', rather it is the dynamic relationship that individuals have with certain material conditions of existence. Urbanism is therefore defined as a particular form of social and physical existence. This is an important point, because it means that urbanism can be legitimately distinguished from other settlement types. One of the important features of urbanism is that it enables social relationships to be constructed which transcend traditional forms of association like kinship. However, architecture does reinforce kinship bonds, as ethnographic studies of traditional houses and villages have often demonstrated (e.g. (Donley-Reid, 1990)(Anon, 1972)(Kus & Raharijaona, 1990)(Anon, 1963)(Tambiah, 1969)), so it is not, therefore, a generic property of architectural boundaries that they will inevitably facilitate the fragmentation ofkin-based social structures. Furthermore, 'traditional' house and settlement forms may be interpreted as culturally specific ways of classifying and ordering the world (Parker Pearson & Richards 1994). The underlying desire for order tends to make their spatial forms fairly static. However, urbanism, as we have seen, has dynamic spatial forms that are subject to continual restructuring. Consequently, villages, hamlets, palaces, kraals and villas are not urban for these reasons. However, it is not clear where urbanism 'begins'; it 'fades in' over time and space and it will be a matter of grasping the historically particular relationship between people and their material conditions as to whether we wish to label a given settlement type 'urban'. So much for a discussion of urbanism generally, but what was Roman urbanism specifically? Itshould be apparent that what made Roman urbanism 'Roman' was the particular way in which inhabitants of the Roman city created and transformed their urban space and how, in turn, those spatial forms helped constitute and sustain society. It is this relationship that will define the nature of Roman urbanism. Clearly we cannot grasp the content of this relationship without examining a particular instance of Roman urbanism. Here, I would like to briefly consider one such instance, namely the city of Pompeii (figure 1) in order to show the relevance of the ideas outlined above. The purpose is not to try and provide an exhaustive account of Pompeian space. Indeed, we might wonder just how reliable conclusions drawn from one example will be? Certainly, a more in-depth understanding of Roman urbanism will require a more detailed study of numerous cases. However, the high level of preservation at Pompeii does provide us with an unparalleled opportunity with which to begin to explore the reflexive relationship between the physicality of the Roman urban form and the society that produced and dwelt within it. Firstly, there is plenty of evidence from Pompeii to suggest that space was continually restructured as a resu It of the action of different social and cultural pressures. But, what were these 'pressures'? (Zanker, 1988) has made a particularly valuable contribution in this respect precisely because he has related the physical shape of the city to social and cultural changes throughout its history. The thrust of Zanker's thesis is that the 'townscape' (Stadtbild) of Pompeii reflects changes in the attitudes and interests of the city's population through time. Zanker argues that in the Samnite city of the second century BC there was little concern for civic pride, with only piecemeal construction of some Greek-style buildings for leisure and entertainment around the old forum. Instead, the city's leading families consumed their wealth in the form of expensive town-houses that were strongly influenced by Hellenistic prototypes. Along with the founding of the Roman colony in 80 BC, came the Roman 'civic ideology' . This inevitably brought about a change of emphasis that resulted in the construction of new public buildings and further development of the forum area. The concern for civic pride intensified further from the Augustan period onwards as the leading families of Pompeii vied with one another to show their allegiance to the emperor and the imperial order. This manifested itself in the construction of buildings in the forum that specifically honoured the emperor and the imperial family. Maiuri (1942) has similarly explained alterations to Pompei an houses in terms of changing social pressures. He has identified a process whereby large properties were split into smaller ones, with 'flats' installed in upper stories and 'shops' in front rooms. For Maiuri this signified the 'invasion ' of a class of 'new men ' , whose wealth was based on commerce and who drove the traditional patrician families out of their houses. However, (Anon, n.d.) has argued strongly against this view. Instead , he argues that the locating of shops in a 'patrician' dwelling reflects a Roman cultural ambivalence towards the world of production and commerce. Elite social sensibilities meant that production and commerce could not be embraced, but yet, on the other hand, they were a ready source of profit. If Zanker is right and public space increasingly became the focus for elite social competition, then the pressure to accumulate wealth, in order to compete more successfully, is perfectly understandable. The above research clearly shows how social processes were responsible for the creation and transformation of spatial forms in Pompeii and, as we have seen, understanding these is crucial to comprehending what made Roman urbanism, 'Roman'. However, we also know that such processes have no reality outside the daily routines of social life. The way in which social life proceeded would have, in turn, been conditioned and supported by the very physical fabric of the city itself. What effect, then, did urban space have on the 'way of life' in Pompeii? (Anon, 1994)(Anon, n.d.), for instance, has shown how the number of doorways in a street affected the level of activity within it. By establishing a ratio between the length of a street and the number of doorways, he has been able to demonstrate that there was more activity in some parts of the city than in others. Most notably the streets with the highest levels of activity were those which provided routes through Pompeii or into the forum . This, Laurence suggests, indicates that the street system conditioned interaction between the inhabitants of Pompeii and visitors to the city by keeping visitors away from those areas where the inhabitants resided . From this, we can conclude that the street system helped create and sustain a categorical distinction between those normally resident in the city and those who visited it. This, in turn, suggests the formation of a cjvic identity that bonded the inhabitants of Pompeii together as a single community and so helped sustain the civic pride identified by Zanker. On the other hand, this community was internally differentiated; something which is revealed through the complex pattern of architectural boundaries found in Pompeii (figure 2). These architectural boundaries functioned to differentiate households from one another and to separate householders from one another within each household. This degree of separation would have generally created weaker bonds between individuals and so lower levels of familiarity. At the same time, such an intensive segmentation of space would have provided a range of settings that would have enabled individuals to have been routinely involved in many different activities and situations . This, as we have seen, is symptomatic of urbanism as a way of life. The particular form of social existence supported by Pompei an spatial segmentation may be understood from research done on the social function of Roman houses (Clarke 1991; Dwyer 1991 ; Grahame 1995; Wallace-Hadrill 1988, 1994). What is signific ant is that Pompeian houses vary considerably in size, shape and spatial layout. Indeed, the orthodox view that there was a 'typical' Roman house needs to be treated with some scepticism. Houses of varying sizes suggests social inequality and this is in agreement with our understanding of Roman urban life as centred on social competition. Roman houses functioned to support this competitive process through their role in sustaining relations of patronage and clientage. Wallace-Hadri II (Anon, n.d.), in particular, has shown how the architecture and decoration of the house was used to help regulate how deeply individuals of different social rank could penetrate its fabric. This enabled the male head of the Roman household to vary how accessible he was to others, being more intimate with his social equals and more distant with those considered socially inferior. The house, in this way, helped generate and reinforce social distinctions. In more general terms, I have argued that space was differentiated in Pompeian houses so as to induce patterns of social interaction that enabled social hierarchies to be constructed and maintained within each household (Anon, n.d.). Larger houses (i .e. those wi th more spaces) were therefore ' instruments' that enabled a more extensive range of social positions to be created and so generated more power for the individual at the head of the network. This power came through having direct control over a large number of individuals who were not only a source of wealth and labour, but also a visual symbol of social standing (Anon, n.d.). Being powerful and being seen to be powerful made an individual 'worth knowing' and so generated a range of social connections that went beyond the household . Nevertheless, power was clearly anchored in the house and household. The more substantial this base, the more effectively an individual could have competed in the public arena. Consequently, rather than replacing private luxury, we might suspect that the emergence of a civic identity in Pompeii actually stimulated it, since large and expensive houses were a direct source and expression of social power. The accumulation of wealth and power they permitted, allowed for increasingly more extravagant public benefactions, which , in turn, reinforced the ideology of civic pride. Success in the public sphere further reinforced the building and decoration of private houses, as individuals vied for the social power that made them more effective in public life. Private luxury and public munificence were consequently locked in an ongoing cycle of mutual reinforcement. If Pompeii is representative, social competition in the Roman city, at least in Italy, was consequently played out in two separate, but related arenas : the private space of the house and the public spaces of the city. The two were linked, as (Anon, n.d.)) has usefully pointed out, through a daily cycle of activities which switched the main centres of social competition from private to public and back again . The presence of two arenas for social competition blurred the distinction between public and private space and public and private life. This is one ofthe most important features that made Roman urbanism peculiarly 'Roman'. The 'blurring' of public and private, however, arose because of the way the physical fabric of the city helped engender certain patterns of social interaction. The contrast with Greek urbanism, for instance, is instructive. Although possessing civic institutions and public buildings similar to those found in the Roman city, the houses of Greek cities (e.g. Olynthos) were, by contrast, relatively small units of a standard size (Jameson, 1990)). This indicates that the distinction between public and private was more sharply drawn in the Greek city. Houses were places of retreat and seclusion, not loci of extensive social networks. Furthermore, the Greek city supported a society with a less unequal distribution of wealth and power. Both Greek and Roman cities were certainly urban, but they were the locus for, and engendered, different forms of social existence. The comparisons could be multiplied if we were to contrast Roman urbanism with Medieval, Early Modern or Modern urbanism , but there is not the space here to do so. However, it should be apparent how we can employ the general approach to urbanism developed in this paper to arrive at a more specific understanding of Roman urbanism. This paper began by asking if theories of Roman urbanism matter. The answer is clearly that they do, but what should be apparent is that all theories are not equally appropriate. Theories are structured sets of generalised assumptions about reality and there is a need to be critical of them in order to establish their validity. The economic models of ancient urbanism discussed at the outset assume a number of things and these, when considered critically, cannot be sustained . In attempting to arrive at a theory of Roman urbanism the methodological procedure for those who advocate the use of economic models has been to utilise the available material to attempt to validate One model or another. Because the surviving evidence is obviously capable of sustaining more than one model, the result is uncertainty. Methodologically, this type of analytical procedure is unidirectional in that an abstract theory is ' applied' to the evidence. Instead, I have advocated a critically reflexive approach to urbanism that attempts to conceptualise the relationship between human society and architectural boundaries. Rather than simply using the physical remains of the city to 'prove', 'disprove' , or even ' modity' this theory, the theory itself provides a framework of understanding that permits us to interpret the physical structure of the city. By examining the layout of Pompeii it was possible to begin to grasp the nature of the relationship between space and society in the Roman city. This exercise did not provide an empirical validation of the framework and indeed it could not. Similarly, if we were to examine a series of Roman cities and were to find that they each supported qualitatively different social networks, this would not invalidate the framework either. On the contrary, the framework would provide the theoretical basis for assimilating a whole series of different results. In contrast, economic models cannot cope with difference, since they are supposed to be ideal-types: close approximations to ' reality' and empirical analysis is supposed to improve and not decrease their descriptive power. It should be clear from this paper that, if we wish to make sense of Roman urbanism, we need a radical change of direction . Economic theories of ancient urbanism do not provide us with a useful way of conceptualising and interpreting the phenomenon that was Roman urbanism. I would consequently argue that we need to dispense with such theories. No amount of empirical work will ever demonstrate which model is the most appropriate and certainly no amount of revision could ever address the criticisms levelled at them earlier in this paper. I have outlined an alternative approach that tries to relate urban space and society reflexively by drawing on social theory. The framework so generated enables us to create an understanding of Roman urbanism by engaging directly with, and interpreting, the surviving evidence for it. In this sense, the 'theory' of urbanism offered here is not a theory a/urbanism itself; rather it is a theory of how to arrive at an understanding of it.",

    "full_text": "Botanical and zoological data from two excavations within Pompeii, the HOllse of the Wedding of Hercules (VII. (Anon, n.d.)) and the House of the Vestals (VI. (Anon, n.d.), are used here to go beyond a city frozen by the eruption, to understand the dynamics of the vibrant pre-AD 79 community. The diachronic nature of the deposits are examined in order to study the exploitation of the natural resources as the city develops, while the analysis of two spatially disparate dwellings allows a house in the heart of the 'old city' to be compared to a house close to the city walls . The disposal of domestic waste is also studied and finally the use of food in the ritual lives of the inhabitants of these houses is analysed. The House of the Vestals (VI. (Anon, n.d.)) is situated close to the city walls, near to the Herculaneum gate (figure I). The Anglo-American Project in Pompeii has been recording the standing remains and undertaking stratigraphic excavation here since 1995. Secondly, the House of the Wedding of Hercules (VII. (Anon, n.d.)) is close to the central forum area and is being excavated by the University of Rome. Both of these houses had developed into large and elaborate properties by the time of the AD 79 eruption and both were clearly the homes of wealthy Pompeian families (e.g. D. Robinson forthcoming; (Jones & Robinson, 1998). Environmental data from two distinct phases in the lives of the two properties were analysed (phases 2 and 3) (Carafa, 1997)). In the House of the Wedding of Hercules, phase 2 (from the 4th to the first half of the 2 nd century BC) relates to the early Hellenistic house, while phase 3 (from the second half of the 2 nd century BC) sees the development of the typical atrium house. The environmental data from the House of the Vestals mainly relate to this later phase, with the exception of an earlier (phase 2) ritual deposit. The retrieval of environmental remains from the House of the Vestals has been 'near-total' with the screening of all stratified deposits through 5-mm sieves. From here the majority of the faunal remains was retrieved. In addition, a sample of every uncontaminated context was screened using a modified Ankara-style flotation tank. This systematic flotation process was responsible for the recovery of the majority of fish bones and the carbonised and mineralized plant remains. Conversely the strategy of retrieval at the House of the Wedding of Hercules was somewhat less intensive. No systematic on-site screening was undertaken, but large-scale flotation was possible. The difference in retrieval strategies has affected the faunal assemblages in particular and the implications of this are considered in the following interpretations. Dietary evidence from the plant remains has been found in two kinds of deposits: cesspits/drains and rubbish pits. At the House of the Wedding of Hercules a cesspit dates to phase 2 and 3, while at the House of the Vestals several drains have been assigned to phase 3. The plant remains recovered from both types of context are preserved as mineralized remains and this suggests that varying states of preservation should not be a factor. In addition, as both types of deposit resulted from the same depositional processes (essentially cess), it is hoped that the plant assemblages from both households are a true reflection of the food consumed by the occupants. A direct comparison of the species present in phase 2 and 3 deposits from the House of the Wedding of Hercules, with those from phase 3 deposits from the House of the Vestals, should stress changes in the use of plants over time, as well as variations between the two households. An attempt has been made to compare the edible plant species from the two sites by assigning the plant species to one of three broad categories: fruits, cereals and spices (figure 2). Quantitative data have not been considered as the relative importance of the various species between samples is strongly affected by preservation factors (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Instead the presence/absence of species allows an immediate comparison to be made. Clearly the assemblage from the House of the Vestals presents a greater range of spices and fruits than was recovered from the deposits at the House of the Wedding of Hercules. This indicates a wider availability of food resources at the House of the Vestals and may reflect the wealth of the occupants of this house (for archaeological evidence see (Jones & Robinson, 1998) or more generally an increase in the range of produce avai lable in the city by phase 3. A predominance of millet (Panicum miliaceum) in the cereals present in a phase 2 cesspit from the House of the Wedding of Hercules was particularly noteworthy. This is in contrast to the almost complete absence of millet from phase 3 deposits from the House of the Vestals. The dearth of millet from the House of the Vestals may indicate a significant difference between the two assemblages, especially as in later periods millet was considered to be a food of the poor (Pliny NH xviii.!I7). The change in the frequency of millet between the two phases and the two houses, however, can be interpreted in various ways . It could either represent a shift in the economic significance of this species (with a decline in the importance of this crop), or alternatively a difference in the wealth of the occupants of the two households at two different stages in their history. Rubbish deposits found at the House of the Wedding of Hercules (phase 2) also indicate the presence of millet. This millet is always associated with barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (both free-threshing (Triticum sp.) and emmer (Triticum dicoccum) and another species of millet, Italian millet (Setaria italica). The plant assemblage recovered from these rubbish pits also reveals a common association between cereal grains and chaff, in particular emmer glume bases. In contrast, chaff is absent from later contexts and this is true for both houses. The presence of chaff generally indicates that part of the crop processing of cereals was occurring close by. Its subsequent absence from later deposits in Pompeii represents a shift in the location of crop processing away from these houses, probably to the many villae rusticae where cereals were produced or to the numerous bakeries of Pompeii. A similar interpretation has also been made for the plant assemblages recovered from the excavations of 1.9.11-12 (M, 1999). In order to compare the faunal data from both houses, it was necessary to exclude the fish remains. As retrieval at the House of the Vestals was 'near-total', fish bones and scales dominated this assemblage and indicated that this marine resource was commonly consumed (Anon, n.d.). Conversely the recovery of fish remains from the House of the Wedding of Hercules was so poor that direct comparisons were extremely difficult. Instead the faunal analysis concentrates on the consumption of the four main domesticates, cattle, sheep(/goat), pig and chicken. The few dog and horse bones that were retrieved probably represent the remains of working animals and certainly no butchery marks were seen. The wall paintings and mosaics of Pompeii suggest that dogs were kept for hunting and guarding, while horses (mules and donkeys) were used for riding and to pull carts and turn mills (Anon, n.d.). Animal remains from the House of the Wedding of Hercules have been found in both phase 2 and 3 deposits. These indicate a change in diet over time with a relative increase in the percentage of pig and a decline in cattle and chicken (figure 3). interestingly, the faunal data from phase 3 deposits from the House of the Vestals are very similar to phase 3 at the House of the Wedding of Hercules (cf. figure 3 and 4). The only difference is a higher proportion of chicken bones at the House of the Vestals and this probably reflects the more comprehensive retrieval strategy at this site. Perhaps by phase 3 there was no difference in ability of these two households to procure a wide range of plant and animal foodstuffs. Using the proportions of domestic animals to determine dietary status is extremely difficult, if not impossible. An indication of high status consumption, however, may be identified by the slaughter patterns calculated from epiphyseal fusion and dental eruption and wear data. The slaughter patterns identified for pigs and sheep are similar from both properties. Over 80% of the pigs from both households were slaughtered as juveniles or young adults. The age data for sheep also indicate a widespread slaughter of juveniles, with significant numbers killed in their first year and the majority of animals dead by the end of their second year. These juvenile pigs and sheep indicate that prime pork and lamb were the preferred meats and, in part, corroborate the literary references to suckling pig as a Roman delicacy (cf. Columella VII.9.4). They suggest that the inhabitants of both the House of the Vestals and the House of the Wedding of Hercules had no need to consume poor quality meat from old animals and instead enjoyed diets of some status. From the House of the Wedding of Hercules where more cattle bones were retrieved, a different strategy of procurement seems to have occurred. Although fusion and dental data were limited, there was an apparent lack of juvenile and sub-adult cattle available for slaughter. It is likely that cattle were more valued for their milk or as traction animals to facilitate crop husbandry in the fertile Campanian plain. Perhaps the value of cattle, in terms of their secondary products, meant that young animals rarely made it onto the tables of Pompeii, even the tables of the elite. In general terms, the quantity of animal bones recovered from the House of the Vestals and the House of the Wedding of Hercules is very small. Even though thousands of fragments have bt:en recorded, very few contexts have produced the intensity of domestic refuse normally associated with urban contexts. Certainly from the House of the Vestals, the quality of the retrieval procedures and the survival of fine fish, bird and rodent bones proves that material has not been lost through poor excavation or taphonomic decay. Despite the assertion that retrieval has been ' near-total', however, a bias still exists in the faunal assemblages. Atypically this is not the small bones and small species usually lost to decay or missed during excavation. Instead the most cumbersome bones of the largest species, . in this case cattle, are absent. Although the paucity of cattle bones may reflect food preferences, the systematic collection and removal of these large bones may also have occurred. The few cattle bones that have been retrieved tend to be the smaller bones from the lower legs and feet. This is not a product of the ease of identification, however, as very few 'cattle-sized' long bone fragments have been recorded . As this phenomenon cannot be explained by taphonomic bias, human activity is indicated. Although the possibility of leather-working cannot be discounted entirely (the lower leg bones may have entered the house attached to hides), an efficient means of rubbish disposal within the city would explain this retrieval pattern . Certainly any type of debris, including food waste, was rarely buried in the ground. The position of the House of the Vestals on the city wall would have allowed this household to dispose of its waste over the wall. This clearly happened elsewhere as excavations by a Japanese team at the site of the supposed Capua gateway have revealed large deposits of animal bone (for excavation details see (Anon, 1995)). These presumably represent the disposal of the city's waste. The faunal data, however, indicate that the inhabitants of the centralised house of the Wedding of Hercules also disposed of their domestic debris. Perhaps a more formalised system of rubbish removal was in operation, at least collecting waste from the elite houses of Pompeii. Literary references certainly indicate that a rubbish collection and street cleaning service was in operation in Rome, with carts being used to take away all kinds of refuse (Tacitus, Annates 11.32; Valerius Maximus 1.7). Whether rubbish disposal in Pompeii was the responsibility of an individual household or provided as a community service, the implications for the faunal assemblages are significant. Together, the small quantity of domestic debris and the dearth of the larger bones of the larger species indicate that the faunal data from both excavations represent only a fraction (and a biased fraction) of the meat diet consumed by these households. Some animal and plant remains, however, were quite deliberately deposited within Pompeii, both in houses and temples. As early as 1899 Pompeian archaeology recognised that food was used in ritual activities. Ritual pits containing burnt figs, pine kernels and cones, nuts and dates (Anon, 1982) were found during excavations of the Temple of Isis. The excavations at the House of the Vestals have also provided insight into the use of food in rituals. Here foundation rituals associated with the initial laying out and building of the first part of the House of the Vestals have been identified. In the early house a pit lay entirely inside the boundary of the tabl inurn (Anon, n.d.)(Jones & Robinson, 1998). Although the pit was of substantial size, its fill contained no evidence of domestic debris. The only finds were a collection of small incense cups, neonatal pig bones and various plant and other food remains The plant and animal assemblages excavated from the House of the Vestals and the House of the Wedding of Hercules have provided valuable insights into the diets, rubbish disposal practices and the ritual lives of these two households. The faunal and floral remains recovered from the two houses span at least a 300-year period of Pompeii's development. During this period the entire character of the urban area changed from a sparsely populated hill top enclosure to a thriving densely occupied city (e.g. (Carafa, 1997)). The environmental remains offer the potential to investigate how the food supply to the city changed during this crucial period and opens up the possibility of interpreting the diachronic nature of food consumption. The plant remains suggest that the range of foodstuffs was less extensive in the earlier phase of the city (phase 2). In addition, millet, a 'poverty' crop was utilised and chaff remains indicate that crop processing occurred within individual households . Lamb and chicken dominated the meat diet, although pork and beef were also available. In contrast, phase 3 deposits contained no chaff and this may indicate that by the second half of the second century BC either the bakeries of Pompeii had taken over the role of crop processing or that this activity took place outside the town. By this time the range of plant species had increased to include new species of fruits and spices (e.g. peppercorn, sesame and melon) and pork consumption had apparently increased at the expense of beef and chicken. The two houses were also unusually clean and the dearth of environmental remains suggests a systematic policy of ru bbish disposal. This may be a reflection of the wealth of the owners of the two properties. The scale and the grandiose nature of the domestic architecture suggests that the House of the Vestals and the House of the Wedding of Hercules would have needed a large household staff who may have been responsible for taking waste to the city dump. Alternatively there may have been a municipal collection policy as happened in Rome. This observation, however, has serious implications for accurate dietary reconstruction as the larger bones and the bones of the larger species were apparently discarded with more thoroughness than those of the smaller species. Finally, the environmental remains recovered from the House of the Vestals and the House of the Wedding of Hercules have provided insights into the ritual practices of these households. The excavations beneath the tablinum of the House of the Vestals suggest that the foundation of a house was a highly sacred act wrapped up in ritual activities, accompanied by the sacrifice of piglets and the deposition of breads and fruits. Such a deposit was apparently an exceptional occurrence and this should be set alongside the everyday food rituals that gave a portion of every meal to the household lares . In Pompeii, food was an integral part of both everyday and exceptional ritual activity. This paper represents a new scientific approach to Pompeian archaeology. The ongoing excavations in the House of the Vestals and the House of the Wedding of Hercules are revealing the stratigraphic record of the pre-AD 79 ground surfaces and the environmental remains, along with the artefact groups, are being rigorously collected. To date, however, it has only been possible to study two large and imposing properties. Consequently, the hypotheses of an increasingly varied diet and an efficient rubbish disposal system may be biased by the activities that occurred in the houses at the upper end of the property spectrum. It is hoped that as excavations extend to include a more representative sample of Pompeian houses, a city-wide analysis of diet, rubbish disposal and ritual practices will be possible.

    "title": "Unequal housing in Pompeii: using house size to measure inequality",
    "abstract": "House size is often used as a tool to calculate wealth in ancient societies, and thus it is also a potential source for the study of inequality. The site of Pompeii, on the Bay of Naples in southern Italy, was first inhabited about 800 years before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius buried it 79 CE. The city provides one of the largest data sets of private architecture in the Roman world, and it has been utilized to calculate the level of inequality in a Roman urban setting. Nonetheless, to understand the inequality of the entire society of the city, these calculations need to be developed. This article uses quantitative and statistical methods, such as Gini coefficients, Lorenz Curves, and also simpler graphs and their interpretation to advance establish methods for exploring inequality through house and building size. A method is proposed for identifying the top economic elite in this urban setting, and the article develops the calculation of inequality further, to encompass even individuals who did not own buildings. As a result, excavated Pompeii's top economic elite is estimated to have comprised 50 to 100 households, with a high level of inequality evident in this ancient city during its final phase, the year 79 CE.",
    "full_text": "The size of privately owned land plots is a frequently applied indicator of wealth in archaeological scholarship. Although identifying the limits of plots from the archaeological record can often be tricky, there is one source that is relatively straightforward to analyze: private houses. Consequently, house size is often used as a wealth indicator in archaeology. This article examines how the urban housing data on ancient Roman Pompeii, datable just before the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE, can function as a source for the study of inequality. The primary source material for this article is the recovered remains of Pompeian private architecture, and the focus here is on two methodological aspects: how house size can be used to recognize the economic elite of an urban environment, and how well housing reflects the general inequality of the entire population of a city. Methodologically, the study utilizes different types of quantitative and statistical analysis, such as Gini coefficients and Lorenz Curves, but also simpler graphs. The Gini coefficient is a measurement of the statistical scattering within a group -often used for income or wealth inequality -and the Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of the scattering, where from the Gini coefficient can be calculated. In a Lorenz curve graph, the Gini coefficient is the ratio of the area (a in Figure 12) between the line of equality (the straight line at 45 degrees from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of the graph) and the Lorenz curve over the entire area under the line of equality (a + b in Figure 12). The formula is: Gini = a/(a + b). The values range between one and zero. A value of one indicates maximum inequality; for example, one person owning everything and the others none. Zero means total equality, where everybody has an equal amount. In this case, the Lorenz curve follows the line of equality. Using house sizes as the basis of the Gini calculation is already a frequent practice in archaeology; in particular, scholars of the pre-Columbian Americas and the classical archaeology have adopted similar methods (e.g. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The amount of scholarship on Pompeian houses is overwhelming, but the study of Pompeian inequality has received surprisingly little attention (Anon, n.d.). There are numerous studies on the different strata of Pompeian society, yet observations on the connections between them and their interrelationships, particularly tensions -such as inequality -are often absent. One obvious reason for this is that connecting the houses to individual social groups has been difficult (Anon, n.d.). While there are some rough estimations of Pompeian inequality, such as Geoffrey (Kron, 2014), they are based on small samples, and the full potential of Pompeii's vast archaeological record has not been utilized from such a broader perspective until quite recently. Miko Flohr's chapter in the book The Economy of (Anon, n.d.) represents the first major attempt to use a large amount of Pompeian archaeological evidence to explore levels of inequity in the city. Pompeii as an archaeological site is quite exceptional and provides material that is rarely available from other sites of the same era (around the 1 st century CE). Additionally, the city is famous for its well-preserved private dwellings, which provide an excellent and well-studied foundation for research. Perhaps even more importantly, the excavated area of Pompeii is comparatively largeabout three-quarters of the area inside the city walls -thus offering a body of source material that likely represents the entire city reasonably well (Anon, n.d.). I will limit exploration to areas inside the city walls and to the parts that are already excavated (Figure 1). Thanks to Flohr's work this material is accessible in quantitative format, and this current article relies on his calculations and materials (Flohr, 2017)(Flohr, 2018). There are several problems with using house size as a measurement of wealth and inequality: some already acknowledged by Flohr and several are mentioned by Westgate (2021, see also (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Notably, the dwelling does not always correlate with the owner's wealth and the location of the house might be more important than its size. Building a house corresponding to the owner's wealth might be impossible in an urban environment, or might be discouraged by general attitudes. Archaeology, of course, is also partial and we may lack information about upper floors and movable items, clear house boundaries and other information lost prior to excavations that might have reflected additional value. Finally, it will always be an important question and a focus on how house data exclude those in society who did not own property, such as the enslaved and the poor. Such issues might influence the results and potential problems need to be acknowledged but some at least are not major inhibitors when studying Pompeii. Building of large houses was very realizable: many had a ground plan of several hundred square meters (e.g. Figure 2) and even some numbering in the thousands. The enlargement of existing houses might have occasionally been impossible, and then wealth could be used for other means of display, such as house decoration (Anon, n.d.). Concerns about the ostentatious display of private luxury in the Roman world do not seem to have filtered into Pompeian architecture, which competed with that of Hellenistic palaces (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The location of the house does not seem to have been of significance in the city and all types of houses are found around the city. There is, however, one area that attracted the upper echelon more than others did, the west and southwest edge of the city, which had a sea view (Figure 3). Houses in this area were perhaps valued more than those in the other parts and they tended to be sizable houses thus ranking high in that regard too. The size of private architecture as a proxy for wealth excludes not only movable artifacts, but also many other types of wealth and assets, such as properties outside the city, currency, loans, debts, and investments. These are often impossible to recognize from an archaeological or material dataset. Pompeii is considered a remarkably full archaeological record but partial preservation and survival means that the movables from houses cannot be reliably compared with each other. Excavations and looting before the beginning of the official excavations disturbed the archaeological record and documentation varies considerably across 200 years (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Despite the challenges, house size can be accepted as a sound indicator of wealth in the archaeological context (Anon, n.d.). At Pompeii where, as (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) has shown, it correlates well with other indicators of wealth, such as several architectural and decorative elements. The atria (a large open hall near the entrance), gardens, peristyles (a colonnade surrounding a garden), and porticoes are all features assumed to reflect high economic status and these are barely present in the first five decimals (50%) of the houses reviewed by Flohr and instead concentrate in the last two decimals when the houses are divided from smallest to largest according to their size score 1 (Table 1). Additionally, the presence of workshops -which were a relatively large investment for a household -also tips a property towards the large end. The workshops are considered to have produced goods for commercial purposes, although in some cases this has been questioned and it has been suggested that they were only for domestic needs, but the size of the workshops probably indicates a primarily commercial function (see (Anon, n.d.). Consequently, workshops were more equally distributed throughout the different sized houses than the high end architectural features mentioned above because they provided tangible economic benefits. Use of workshops and architectural features can lead, however, to quite circular arguments as they tend to be the largest rooms/spaces in Pompeian houses, and thus it is not surprising that they feature in the largest houses. Flohr reduced bias by including the number of rooms as well as house size and Flohr's datasets offer the possibility of comparing the presence of some decorative features with the size of the domestic units, namely evidence for framed pictures, statuary, and vermiculata floors. 2 The last-mentioned appear only almost wholly in the highest decimal of houses. Statuary is concentrated in the last two decimals. Framed pictures are additionally most common in the last two decimals, but they appear relatively more often in the sixth, seventh, and eighth decimals than statuary and vermiculata (Table 2). House size correlates well with these other signs of wealth. In terms of upper floors, (Anon, n.d.), who has researched Herculaneum where upper floors were better preserved in destruction layers, estimates that about 23% of the total surface of Pompeian houses was in the upper floors; however, at Pompeii, a wide range of post-eruption disturbances have destroyed most of the remains of the upper levels. In response, I focus here on ground floors as wealth indicators. The question of upper floors also brings us to the problem of ownership. According to Roman law, the upper floors belonged to the building underneath them, and thus to its owner (Anon, n.d.). They are often considered to have been rented, and without a doubt other parts of the houses in Pompeii were also rented out. (Anon, n.d.) has identified about 450 possible rental units in Pompeii, although he notes that not all of them were necessarily rented. These 450 rental units are small, generally one or two room sections of a building complex, or upper floors, but some scholars suggest that even large houses could have been rented (see e.g. (Pirson, 1997)(Anon, n.d.). It is impossible, however, to determine exactly which units were rented, as the Pompeian archaeological record does not provide clear evidence to separate them from those used by the owner but it is possible to make different estimates of how property was divided, as demonstrated later in this paper, and to create different scenarios to accommodate variations on the number of possible rented units. The small amount of the cases, where the property owner can be identified, suggests that the houses were mainly owned by a single owner (Anon, n.d.), and consequently most of the housing units in Pompeii were likely owned by a single person, a pater familias -which as a legal term means a property owner and is not gender-specific. The pater familias controlled the entire familia, the unit including the other family members, other persons living in the house, and the property itself (on the term pater familias and the inhabitants of the Roman house see, (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). However, co-ownership was also possible according to Roman law (e.g. (Anon, n.d.), and even likely in some cases of inheritance and commercial ownership. The spatial compositions of some Pompeian houses can be interpreted to suggest these types of divisions but firm conclusions are difficult to achieve. House boundaries and walls are relatively easy to define but they might easily contain shared houses and multiple households as argued for Casa di Sirico (Figure 4, see (Anon, n.d.), or had shared gardens and architectural features as is perhaps the case of insula I,15 (Figure 5). All of its units -except the small property composed of the three rooms opening at entrance I,15,5 -are connected with each other through doors. This might be one large complex, or three isolated buildings, or perhaps the large garden belongs to one of the housing units at the north end -but which one -or was it co-owned? Flohr supplements the number of rooms in his calculation of the house size (Flohr, 2017)(Anon, n.d.). By combining the area and the number of rooms, Flohr's database (2018) offers a relative value for the house size, which he calls the score. I will refer to it as the F-score. It is calculated with the formula: 100 x [(room number/maximum number of rooms) + (plot size/maximum plot size)] (Anon, n.d.). The F-score eliminates the problem that every space is treated equally if the rooms are merely counted. In dealing with house boundaries and units of ownership, Flohr (2018) presents two different sets, one for independent domestic units and one for independent buildings. The domestic unit set has 1017 independent housing units. It is the most numerous house dataset used in this investigation, meaning that its results are the most equal of the used datasets, because it has the most independently owned units. The independent building dataset has 564 units and is the smallest of the house datasets used here. It combines the spatially close architectural units of the domestic unit dataset, for instance the tabernae to house VII,1,25 (Figure 4), creating large combinations called independent buildings. In my work, I have integrated a third data set based on Schoonhoven's measurements of house areas in (Anon, n.d.), see also (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). I call this group the private complexes and it comprises 917 privately owned units. This is larger than Flohr's second dataset but in my study, it is the dataset that produces the maximum evidence of inequality. This is because Schoonhoven combined all of the units that are connected by a door, so for example, in this dataset Casa di Sirico would comprise both units, VII,1,25 and VII,1,47, as one structure (Figure 4). This results in many large and conversely many very small units. Schoonhoven's data also excludes some areas of the excavated area of Pompeii (Regiones III, IV, insulae V,5 VI,17, VII,16, VIII,2, see Figure 1 for their locations) and it does not integrate architectural features like the F-score. Finally, there is the issue of factoring in non-house owners. However, even if we think that the pater familias was the sole house owner, the property can also reflect the wealth of the other family members on some level and perhaps some other types of inhabitant as legal rights to property can be held through inheritance, or through divorce, when a dowry was returned to the wife or her family. I deal with the invisibility of non-house owners by creating two datasets to calculate the Gini coefficient, one comparing individuals and one households. The Gini coefficient of individuals estimates the inequality between everyone, including women, children, enslaved persons, people renting, and so on. The household Gini coefficient instead divides the population into households. In this case, it is the household that can be considered to have some legal property-owning rights pertaining to the house. It thus separates the enslaved from the household, as the possible property controlled by them was legally under the control of the person who owned the enslaved person (Anon, n.d.). The Gini calculations of the households made in this article also include an estimate of households that did not own a house, which are not usually included in calculations that use house size as the proxy for inequality. The households that did not own a house receive a value of zero. In sum, by using several datasets that reflect different scenarios of ownership, it is possible to produce several reasonable estimates of inequality based on the house size data. These estimates then create a range of values that define the scope of inequality in ancient Pompeii. In The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity (Anon, n.d.) introduce a thought experiment suggesting that for an outside observer both a society where everybody is similar and a society where everybody is totally different would appear equally 'egalitarian'. This is a hypothetical case, as no such examples can be found, yet it offers a good starting point to examine how the size of lodgings might be a proxy for recognizing the equality or inequality of a society. Pompeii would fit into the second category, as every house is more-or-less of different size (see e.g. Figure 2), and thus for the outside observer the city and its housing might appear to signal an equal society, where every individual expresses themselves differently. However, even excluding all of the other evidence on Pompeian and Roman society that presents a picture of inequality (e.g. literary and material sources about enslavement, and the hierarchical structure of society, where family background and wealth played an important defining role in status), and only focusing on relative house size, evidence suggests an unequal community. Any comprehensive listing of private building sizes in Pompeii that includes both the largest houses and the smaller dwellings aptly demonstrates that there is a huge gap between the two extremes. This is easily visible on the graphs that rank the houses according their size (e.g. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The basic trend is always of exponential growth towards the larger house sizes. Figure 6 illustrates the Pompeian domestic units from smallest to largest according to their F-score. The curve indicates steep inequality. The houses on the right end of the graph are tens or even a hundred times larger than the dwellings on the left side of the graph. The right side also features multiple rooms compared to the left: 263 houses on the left side had only one or two rooms, whereas in the hundred last houses on the right the number of rooms ranges from 23 to 78. Consequently, the curve can be additionally utilized as a rough indicator to determine the ratio of Pompeian elite houses amongst the total number of domestic units. This obviously does not offer a clear line of demarcation, and one might expect that in many societies the border is blurry and flexible. The exponential curve begins somewhere after 85% of all domestic units (the brown line, unit I,13,2). Yet, identifying the exact break point is always very subjective, and we can only estimate it roughly. In this case, it is approximately between the 85% line and the 95% line (the brown line, unit VII,2,1-2). Consequently, a reasonable assumption would be to estimate that about 10% (the red line, unit VII,16,1) of Pompeian domestic units were clearly larger than rest, if they are arranged by the F-score. In Figure 7 the domestic units are arranged according to their plot size (excluding the number of rooms), and here the exponential curve starts a bit later, between 90% and 95% of the houses (brown lines). Although the plot division of Schoonhoven is different from Flohr's, the pattern of the graph based on her data is similar, and there the curving can also be estimated to start between 90% and 95% (Figure 8). Therefore, the definition of the economic elite according to the plot size is somewhat stricter than when the number of rooms is included in the calculation. (Flohr, 2017) has already noted the general flexibility of using the number of rooms as a system to measure house size. It is very likely, however, that the same person owned several of these domestic units, and therefore the number of economic elites portrayed here is probably slightly high. If we change our perspective from domestic units to independent buildings (Flohr's database 2018, excluding the public buildings), where several spatially related units are counted as one building, the graph (Figure 9) still looks essentially same with an exponential curve at the end. The beginning of the curve is again somewhere between 90% and 95% (brown lines), or perhaps even between 90% and 92.5% (red line). Even if the percentage (90) is roughly same, the number is much smaller than for domestic units, where it is slightly over 100, while here it is a little under 60. Consequently, approximating by house size, the number of Pompeian economic elite households in the excavated area is somewhere between 60 and 100. As it is likely that some of the buildings were owned by the same person, perhaps the estimate should be 50-100. This range still offers plenty of flexibility to assess the scale of the economic elite, which are unlikely to have been a clearly defined group. Examining the remaining lowest 85% of Pompeian domestic units (Figure 10), the data does not provide the same sharp curve evident in the entire set. Instead, there are three more-or-less linear growth lines, marked with red (solid, dashed, and doted). This does not imply a state of equality as, for example, the difference between the two ends of the dashed line, units VI,3,24 and 1,4,9, are: Fscore 9.45; number of rooms 11; area 139 m 2 . Even so, these numbers are small compared to the extremes of the top 15%, units I,13,2 and I,4,5-6/25/28, where the difference between the F-score is 63.12, the number of rooms is 46, and the area is 1956 m 2 . One can only imagine what level of wealth was invested in the top house, I,4,5-6/25/28, as it was likely several hundred times more than house I,13,2. In the lower 85%, several owners likely invested much more in their houses compared to others, but the difference is low compared the top end. Figure 10 shows three different groups where the house size is relatively equally divided inside the groups, as all of them have the same average and median F-score. For the dotted line both are 16, the dashed line 8, and the solid line 2. If we exclude the solid line, which mostly consist of (Anon, n.d.), see also (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). tabernae, a type of residence that is often considered to have been rented, and calculate the dotted and dashed line together, the average and median are still the same for the group: 10. For the top 15%, the average is 32 and median 27. The lower 85% of Pompeian house owners were by no means equal, but the division of property in the lower groups seems to be a bit more even than in the top 15%. If there were upper floors, the distribution among the smaller houses would likely have been even more equal, as (Anon, n.d.) study indicates that the smallest units in Herculaneum had more upper floors than the second smallest. Although any comparison between the Roman Empire -let alone only Pompeii -and the modern world is hazardous and full of pitfalls, the pattern of Figures 6789is reminiscent of a graph made by Branko Milanovic that represents the percentage of absolute gain in real per capita income received by global income level . In Milanovic's graph the top 15% also dominates the chart, collecting the major share of the gains, and the difference between the distribution is much smaller in the lower 85% compared to the top 15%. Milanovic sees that the economic summit can be controlled only by the existence of a strong middle class, and that the upper class achieves more power by controlling access to top education and intermarrying amongst other persons of the upper class. On the other hand, there is always a possibility to rise to the upper class, although this opportunity is often exaggerated by the lower classes. In politics, according to Milanovic the direction is towards populism and plutocracy, where the rich control the political process by suppressing the vote of the poor and creating a false consciousness for low economic groups moving attention away from economic and social problems to matters of religion, abortion, and migration (Anon, 2016)(Anon, n.d.). Many of the characteristics listed above were similar throughout the Roman World. The middle class was weak or perhaps non-existent: the population between the rich and poor did not seem to form a single consistent group in Pompeii (Anon, n.d.). As there was no public education -although education could occur in public places (García y García 2004, 57-85), it was not public in the modern sense -schooling was controlled by those who could afford it. The sociopolitical elite of Pompeii seems to have been well connected with each other by marriage and other social ties although new members could rise into this group (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The politics of small Roman cities such as Pompeii was regulated by the rules that guaranteed the success of the upper class: candidacy to political offices and positions were open only to citizens -also excluding those who were freed from enslavement. Some professions might also be excluded from candidacy, and there was a minimum wealth requirement -perhaps 100000 sesterces. Furthermore, the costs of the maintaining the offices, including sponsoring public buildings and organized games, were paid -at least partly -by the magistrates themselves (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). While the media opportunities to promote false consciousness in lower economic groups were far more limited, we might imagine public games and events in Pompeii were a useful diversion away from the reality of inequity and economic problems. (Kron, 2014), (Anon, n.d.) and (Kohler et al., 2017)(Kohler et al., 2018) have all used building size to calculate Gini coefficients for Pompeii. Kohler's group did not limit their study to Pompeii, but also examined several other settlements around the globe. They proposed that the level of inequality -as calculated on the basis of dwelling size -increased over the time period of 9000 BC to 100 CE, at least in the Afro-Eurasia. Their study even suggested that wealth in Pompeii was more equally distributed than in the modern United States of America or China. Kohler's study used a sample of 78 dwellings from Pompeii (Kohler et al., 2017), Suppl. Table S2), but no data was provided on which houses were selected for the sample, making it difficult to estimate its comprehensiveness. However, the sample size matches (Anon, n.d.) sample of Regio I (for location of Regio I, Figure 1), so it may be the same; this unfortunately makes it slightly unreliable, as different areas in Pompeii have dissimilarly sized house compared to the range of the entire city (Anon, n.d.). The representativeness of the sample is a minor problem compared to the matter that the Gini coefficient is based only on the dwellings of Pompeii, and therefore it only measures the inequality/equality of property owners. As outlined above, this excludes a large number of non-owners and thus the result is only an estimate of the inequality in the property owning classes in Pompeii. If we take a low estimate of how many people lived in the excavated area of Pompeii (calculation based on (Anon, n.d.) and compare it to the amount of domestic units, the vast majority of people will have zero as their property size value. Figure 11 demonstrates that property owning was distributed very unequally, even if the population is estimated at the lower end of the scale. Naturally, the level of inequality increases as population increases but the number of houses remains the same. The non-owning group is almost invisible in the Pompeian archaeological record, and it is not possible to evaluate their number with the same precision as the building owners. Thus, for an estimate of the number of non-owning people, we must rely on academic approximations of Pompeii's population. I propose four different estimates to minimal and maximal Gini values using (Flohr, 2017) estimations of population (low 7500 and high 13,500) 3 and Massimo Osanna's (2018) approximation of 30,000, based on a newly found inscription 4 and on the basis of the same inscription, I also propose a lower population estimate of 16,500. 5 Despite the multiple studies of Roman demography, it is not easy to find estimates of what percent of the population was free, and what the proportion of adults and children may have been (for problems with the estimates, e.g. (Anon, n.d.)). Yet, both are needed, if we assume that the inscription refers to the number of free adults in Pompeii. There are mean calculations of fertility in the Roman world, which usually estimate around six children per one woman (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). However, if we consider age structure, this does not mean that families had six children all the time. Surviving Egyptian census records from the Roman period (12-259 CE) provide information from which some very rough estimates can be made -although the data is problematic. The proportion of children under age 15 varies somewhere between 25% and 35% (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). The data from Egypt -because of the spatial and temporal differences -cannot be as straightforwardly compared with that of Pompeii, but (Anon, n.d.) estimate of the number of people under 18 of Italians with sui iuris status is also in this range. In my new population estimate, I calculate the number of children is 1.5 for each free women. Earlier scholarship has also proposed several estimates of the number of enslaved people when counting the entire population of Roman Italy. From (Anon, n.d.) estimates, I have approximated that it could be 0.4 times the citizen/free families population. This might be perhaps a little high (see e.g. (Anon, n.d.), but it includes other non-buildingowning people. As the task at hand is to evaluate private architecture as an indicator of inequality, I am limiting examination to the excavated parts of Pompeii; this naturally would have a lower population than the entire city. As (Osanna, 2018) data does not include an estimate of households, I have calculated it, from the assumption that there were 6840 free male citizens. I have estimated, that the (free) adult female population is equal to the male population and used the 1.5 number of children per woman. These factors allow us to calculate the proportion of the rest of the population and the number of households according to that estimate. In all calculations, the number of nonowning families/households is quite complex to estimate, as it is likely that many of this group were living alone, but there were also likely some families, and therefore I have just divided their number by two. I have further decided to also divide the rest of the households by two, as it is likely that several generations lived in the same household. Together with Flohr's and Schoonhoven's data on dwellings, it is now possible to calculate Gini coefficients that also include the people/households that did not own private buildings in Pompeii. Table 3 presents different Gini coefficients for Pompeii, calculated according to owning private architecture. The range is from 0.72 to 0.98. The closest to equal is counted according to Flohr's minimum estimation of population, where the population is divided into households and where the architecture is divided into domestic units (Figure 12). The most unequal is Osanna's estimate, where all persons are counted (Figure 13); the result is the same whatever method of distribution of private architecture one uses. Although one can note some variation, the new more moderate population estimate does not produce values that are very far from Osanna's (Figure 14). This means that if the population is estimated to be on the higher end of the spectrum, as the newly found inscription indicates, the amount of private property is low compared to the population and thus results in high Gini values. Additionally, a comparison of Flohr's private buildings with Schoonhoven's plot sizes is remarkably similar -many of the values are equal -even though the sets were produced by very different means. This shows that, if the property division favors large units, including the room number does not actually greatly influence the results. Household values demonstrate more variation than those counting all individuals (Figures 12-15, Table 3). The household results made based on domestic units are different than those produced on the basis of private buildings and complexes. The domestic unit scenario is one where a relatively low number of people are renting or living in houses owned by other families. The private buildings scenario is one where plenty of property is rented, when the private complexes demonstrate divisions into many units, but there is plenty of variation between their sizes (2-5730 m 2 ). This would thus suggest a lower number of independent units for rental than the private buildings dataset, but more people cohabitating -some likely in rentals -in the same complex, which was owned by one person. Nonetheless, looking at the Gini values that include all individuals, the differences between all three groups are relatively small, and all suggest high inequality. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Cumulative share of size score Cumulative share of households Figure 13. Lorenz curve of Osanna's population estimate, according to private persons and the distribution of private complexes. The very high inequality values for Pompeii might seem exaggerated, but it is not an unlikely scenario. The inscription cited in this article paints a picture of a person with enormous wealthoffering feasts and gladiatorial shows and that they provided charity for the poor and those suffering from famine. Comparison of house sizes suggests significant wealth disparity in excavated Pompeii. The economic elite are argued to have consisted of about 50 to 100 households, who owned at least an equal amount of the largest houses. The elite had at least 40-50% share of all 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Cumulative share of size score Cumulative share of households Figure 14.

Lorenz curve of Flohr's maximum population estimate, according to households and the distribution of private buildings. private architecture. If estimates of the population that did not own private buildings is added, the distribution of wealth becomes even more polarized: the Gini coefficient of the households is between 0.72 and 0.92. This is higher than previous calculations (0.54-0.62) that did not factor in non-owners (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). When changing the perspective from households to individuals, inequality is even more drastically evident; the Gini values are over 0.90 for all calculations. However, these calculations are based only on house size, and calculating the values according to other wealth or income factors might provide different results. All of the Gini coefficients in this article are far from the calculations based on income in the Roman world (0.42-0.44), and also many based on the landowners in Roman Egypt (0.43-0.52) during the early 3 rd and 4 th century CE, however, some landowning estimates of the early 4 th century and early 6 th century come closer (0.62-0.64), and in the mid-4 th century are with the range reported here (0.82-0.86) (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.). Although, these are from within the Roman Empire, they are from a different location and time, and they are not calculated from the house architecture. Together, however, they complement the results here which reveal an extreme picture of polarized wealth and privilege as seen through the lens of urban dwellings, architecture and space. 1. The size score is a combination of the house area and room number, which is explained in detail later in this section as a name F-score. 2. Here mosaic tesserae are small and laid in asymmetric patterns that highlight the subject of the mosaics. 3. (Anon, n.d.) estimates of the population are based on the buildings that he has classified in his database. Every building that he has identified as a taberna is estimated to have had a maximum of four inhabitants and a minimum of three, and furthermore a quarter of the tabernae are considered to not have been inhabited at all in the calculation of the minimum amount of inhabitants, while every unit classified as an apartment has a maximum of five and minimum of two inhabitants, houses twelve and eight, and the group called 'other' eight and four. 4. The inscription is from a monumental tomb outside the Stabian Gate (Figure 1) dated to just before the eruption. The tomb lacks a name, however, the person was wealthy and influential, organizing banquets and games and making philanthropic donations (Anon, n.d.). The inscription mentions a toga virilis celebration offered to Pompeians. The toga virilis rite focused on the masculine realm and the male members of the household were in the central role. There were 456 triclinium-groups (∏-shaped dining couch groups), and each of them had places for 15 people providing 6840 positions for this occasion. Osanna argues this is the number of adult males in Pompeii. 5. Osanna's estimate is high compared to previous ones (Cfr. (Anon, n.d.), and the inscription can possibly be read differently depending on the interpretation of the word homines. The Italian translation in Osanna's article has uomini but English persons. The first suggests males, when the second would also include other genders; homines can be translated in both ways. Yet, if the inscriber -or whoever ordered the inscription -wanted to clearly refer to only males, there were other options, such as viros. Although the toga virilis rite centers around the male members of family, it was also an important occasion for the entire household to participate in (Anon, n.d.)(Dolansky, 2008)) and we know of several powerful women from ancient Pompeii (Anon, n.d.) and several paintings with women shown banqueting with men (Anon, n.d.). Consequently, we cannot assume the number of inhabitants calculated on the basis of the triclinia refers only to the male population.",

    "full_text": "Ivo van der Graaff, Ph.D. The University of Texas at Austin, 2013 Supervisors: John R. Clarke and Penelope J.E. Davies Fortifications often represent the largest and most extensive remains present on archaeological sites. Their massive scale is the primary reason for their survival and reflects the considerable resources that communities invested in their construction. Yet, until recently, they have largely remained underrepresented as monuments in studies on the ancient city. Beyond their defensive function city walls constituted an essential psychological boundary protecting communities from unpredictable elements including war, brigandage, and more elusive natural forces. These factors have led scholars to identify fortifications as playing a distinct role in the definition of a civic identity. Nevertheless, beyond the recognition of some general trends, a definitive diachronic study of their performance within a single urban matrix is still lacking. This dissertation examines the city walls of Pompeii as an active monument rather than a static defensive enclosure. The city preserves one of the most intact set of defenses surviving since antiquity which, in various shapes and forms, served as one its defining elements for over 600 years. Pompeii's fortifications, through construction techniques, materials, and embellishments, engaged in an explicit architectural dialogue with the city, its urban development, and material culture. Their basic framework changed in response to military developments, but their appearance is also the result of specific political and viii ideological choices. As a result, the city walls carried aesthetic and ideological associations reflecting the social and political organization of the community. This study is the first of its kind. It provides a diachronic examination of the Pompeian fortifications by assessing their role in the social and architectural definition of the city. The walls were subject to appropriation and change in unison with the ambitions of the citizens of Pompeii. From their original construction through subsequent modifications, the fortifications expressed multivalent political, religious, and social meanings, particular to specific time periods in Pompeii. This analysis reveals a monument in continuous flux that changed its ideological meaning and relationship to civic identity, in response to the major historical and social developments affecting the city. If our conclusions are just, not only should cities have walls, but care should be taken to make them ornamental, as well as useful for warlike purposes, and adapted to resist modern inventions. For as the assailants of a city do all they can to gain an advantage, so the defenders should make use of any means of defense which have been already discovered, and should devise and invent others, for when men are well prepared no enemy even thinks of attacking them. The aim of this dissertation is to assess the role of fortifications in the establishment of a civic identity for ancient Pompeii. Although fortifications often constitute the most tangible archaeological remains of settlements, scholars have paid little attention to their intrinsic monumental character. In fact, city walls remain largely neglected as monuments despite their standing as one of the major communal investments in urban frameworks. Their sheer scale translated to copious expenditures of resources even on small refurbishments or the erection of single towers and gates. On an architectural level their imposing height, thickness, and elegant masonry carried an unmistakable aesthetic element representing the city and its social hierarchy. Architecture, almost by definition, imposes an experience by announcing defined spaces and directing a viewer through them. Fortifications did this on a grand scale enclosing entire cities for centuries after their construction. Defenses often dictated the future urban layout of cities leading to their role in influencing issues of design and development. These factors ensured that city walls not only responded to military considerations, but also embodied the identity of the city and its inhabitants. Many scholars agree that city walls formed part of the image of an ideal city, yet a diachronic examination of their performance within a single urban matrix is still lacking. Questions remain: What were the dynamics shaping this identity? What roles did fortifications play in the ever changing social realities of a city? This study focuses on a single site and will concentrate on the social, urban, and cultural context of the city walls at Pompeii, treating them as an active monumental boundary marker rather than a static defensive element. The circumstances at Pompeii provide a unique platform for such an analysis: an exceptionally well preserved fortification system, and a wealth of information concerning the social structure and genesis of the city. In addition, preserved graffiti, inscriptions, frescoes, and reliefs provide primary sources on how individuals perceived the structure. The origins of Pompeii as a settlement remain shrouded in mystery; archaeological investigations have only recently started uncovering evidence for the earliest a settlement. Traces of a Bronze Age Palma Campania settlement have surfaced in the highest portions of the plateau near the current Porta Vesuvio, but this phase seems brief, giving way to a considerable hiatus in the archaeological evidence. (Anon, n.d.) Scholars often trace the first signs of an organized settlement to the construction of the Temple of Apollo, the Doric Temple in the Triangular Forum, and the first line of fortifications in the sixth century BCE. Yet a few scant remains suggest that the areas the two temples 1 M.

(Anon, n.d.) Given the italicizing elements of the early Temple of Apollo and the Hellenizing aspects of the Doric Temple, scholars have traced both Etruscan and Greek influences for the foundation of the city. A possibility exists that early Pompeii was first founded as a sanctuary, that later attracted a settlement around it as was sometimes the case in Etruria. (Anon, 1890) In this role the site perhaps functioned as a sacred emporium for the Sarno Valley in a similar fashion to the emporia of Pyrgi and Gravisca for the Etruscan cities of Cerveteri and Tarquinia. (Anon, 1896) Excavations have found evidence for a possible sacred grove associated with the surviving votive column in the House of the Etruscan Column (VI.5.17). Its presence further supports the hypothesis that early Pompeii was a sanctuary, but a clear picture for this earliest phase can only come with further investigations. (Anon, n.d.) Given the paucity of evidence, this analysis will begin with the first tangible signs of an organized settlement coinciding with the construction of the first walled circuit. The current city walls of Pompeii form an elliptical circuit some 3.2 km long (fig. 1). Seven gates, the Porta Stabia, Nocera, Sarno, Nola, Vesuvio, Ercolano, and Marina pierce the line; whereas twelve towers, sequentially numbered in a counterclockwise direction, further fortify it. The principal gates open along the main arteries of the city, and the towers invariably line up at the end of smaller roads. This setup essentially anchors the urban layout of Pompeii.

The third limestone circuit subsequently witnessed at least four further upgrades and modifications spanning the remainder of Pompeian history. Amedeo Maiuri first formulated the current wall sequence using a combination of excavations and previous scholarship. Although scholars have frequently revised the construction dates, they have largely maintained his periodization. (Anon, n.d.) The long and complex debate concerning the dating and phasing of the walls is a matter that will receive further attention in the following chapter. Nevertheless, we should remember that dating walls is a problematic affair due primarily to extended site occupations, and the long chronological use ranges of construction techniques and diagnostic artifacts such as pottery. (Anon, n.d.) Similarly, the specifics of the appearance of the walls and the extent of their survival will concern us later, but a brief description of the individual phases, outlined along the most common scholarly consensus, provides a background for our discussion. (Anon, n.d.) Pompeii flourished in the Archaic and Early Classical (sixth and early fifth centuries BCE) periods before contracting considerably during the fifth century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) In this phase two successive fortified enclosures protected the city. The first fortification, the socalled pappamonte wall, dates to the sixth century BCE. The wall takes its name after the friable tufa, known locally as pappamonte, used to build it. Only one or two foundation (Anon, n.d.) See A. Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei.\" Monumenti Antichi 33 (1929): 113-290. See also, C. Chiaramonte Treré, \"The Walls and Gates.\" In The World of Pompeii, edited by J.J.

This sequence follows Chiaramonte Treré, \"The Walls and Gates,\" 140-150. (Anon, n.d.) See the extensive discussion on the urbanization of this early period in chapter two courses of the otherwise completely buried remains are visible near Tower III where erosion has exposed them to view (fig. 2). They probably were part of a terracing wall holding an earth embankment known as an agger. (Anon, n.d.) The next wall, built in the early fifth century BCE, ran roughly along the same course. Scholars refer to it as the orthostate wall because of the relatively thin, vertically set, slabs of Sarno limestone used to build it (fig. 3). It featured two facing wall façades set some four meters apart. Engineers filled the intervening space with earth according to the typically Greek construction technique known as emplecton. It protected the city for the next few hundred years until the turn of the third century BCE when construction of the third circuit led to its demolition. The knowledge these two early enceintes is primarily the result of excavations and their original appearance, as we shall see, is somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, they shaped the future city designating the locations of gates and anchoring the urban layout of Pompeii for centuries to come. The next wall dates to the turn of the third century BCE. Scholars also refer to it as the Limestone enceinte, or the first Samnite wall. It formed the basis for the currently visible fortified system, which essentially is the result of a series of subsequent upgrades. Mostly built in ashlar masonry, known as opus quadratum, this third enceinte featured an outer wall built using rectangular limestone blocks laid out in a relatively regular header and stretcher system. It acted as an enormous terracing wall supporting a large agger, or earthen embankment, behind it. The gates currently visible in the circuit largely follow the same layout designed for this enceinte. Scholars assign them to the forecourt type 10 F.

Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae (Rome, 2006), 29. featuring a deep passageway through the agger reinforced with two forward bastions and a two-leafed gate closing the rear (fig. 4). (Anon, n.d.) The following intervention on the defenses dates to the time of the Second Punic War. It featured the addition of an internal retaining wall, and the raising of the agger and the outer façade in tufa. The reinforcement resulted in a double parapet creating a deep defensive line and a wider wall-walk (fig. 5). The next reinforcement occurred at the turn of the first century BCE. Engineers primarily used opus incertum, a crude cement faced with small stones, to build vaults in the gates and the towers dotting the circuit. After the installation of the Roman colony in 80 BCE the walls first received a broad refurbishment the extent of which is still debated. They subsequently weakened gradually in the Imperial period. The following earthquake that devastated Pompeii in 62 CE also damaged the walls. The city directed some resources to rebuild the gates, but the curtain wall became a large open air quarry used in the reconstruction effort. The interventions on the fortifications are often pivotal events and the deliberate chronological organization of this dissertation reflects those trends. Each chapter considers the appearance of the city walls in their main phases of development, and contextualizes them in the known social and political make-up of the city. The nature of the evidence at Pompeii, a city excavated almost exclusively to its 79 CE level, means that our knowledge of its development in earlier periods decreases dramatically. As a result, the first chapters analyzing earliest Pompeii focus primarily on known archaeological and architectural remains. The results will provide a basic framework for the subsequent chapters where new forms of evidence, including social expressions 11 G. Brands, Republikanische Stadttore in Italien (Oxford, 1988), 8-29. Generally speaking, as described in the following chapters, individual construction techniques highlight the various architectural elements and building sequence of the gates. Engineers first employed Limestone in the bastions and court, followed by a tufa substitution of the court masonry, and completed by an opus incertum vault on the inside of the city. directly related to the fortifications, allow for wider avenues of research. This study shows that the Pompeian fortifications were an integral part of the city's development and its identity. They incorporated aesthetic and religious elements that inevitably linked to distinct political messages of power that changed and were manipulated over time. The results presented here should add to our view on Pompeian fortifications and antiquity in general, thereby creating new avenues of inquiry on the dynamics of settlement, identity, and conquest. The motivation to carry out this investigation comes from the relative neglect of the city walls in the scholarly discourse concerning the image of the city. In fact, major syntheses of their appearance, role in the community, and even the history of their excavation are still lacking. Similarly, despite their massive scale, no accurate plan or published survey of the current remains exists. The towers in particular are a singular example of this state of affairs. Although scholars often describe them according to the best preserved layouts of Towers X-XII, a basic visual survey, discussed further in chapter four, highlights the existence of at least four distinct types of structures. This situation is symptomatic of Pompeii as an archaeological site, where hundreds of years of excavation have produced a massive published scholarly corpus that sometimes lacks basic architectural plans. This situation is due, in large part, to differing recording standards as archaeology developed as a discipline. This study is therefore also important because it synthesizes large amounts of scattered information concerning the fortifications of Pompeii. As a result, this dissertation focuses heavily on the Pompeian remains and limits its assessment of external comparisons and influences on their design. These factors will necessarily have to be examined in a more expansive approach that builds on the results of this study. A useful introduction to the importance of fortifications in the development of a communal identity is to trace their role in the urbanization process. The construction of fortifications in antiquity entailed diverse anthropological concerns pertaining to the genesis of a communal identity. These included the protection of the territorial, economic, religious, and political interests of a community and went hand in hand with the development of city states. (Anon, n.d.) Defense is a main factor behind the origins of urbanization and fortifications gradually evolved in step with urban development and the formation of institutions. (Anon, n.d.) Strongholds in particular allowed small communities to retain their cultural autonomy and, as a last line of defense, they placed their most prized assets, including gods, wealth, and magistrates, within their confines to keep them safe. (Anon, n.d.) Relatively small bands of soldiers could easily use the enclosure to hold out against a numerically superior enemy and the population felt safer inside the stronghold rather than facing invading forces out in the open. (Anon, n.d.) The refuge also functioned actively as a staging point to protect the territory. Defenders could exploit their intimate knowledge of the terrain to set devastating ambushes and launch effective counterattacks to defend critical unmovable elements such as fields, pastures, water sources, hunting areas, sources of raw materials, and trade routes. (Anon, n.d.) Therefore, the construction of defenses signaled a community's territorial assertions toward outsiders and reflected the symbolic boundary 12 M.J.

(Anon, n.d.) Rowlands, \"Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements,\" 448. between the collective dwelling and the outside world. (Hansen, 2000) Such territorial claims also expressed the emotional and historical ties binding a community to a specific region and increased the feeling of security against outsiders. Warfare constituted a main factor in the drive toward urbanized society. For example, during the Roman Republic ten percent of freeborn men annually joined the army and modern estimates of state expenditure on military budgets suggest an amount as much as seventy to eighty percent. (Cornell, 1995) These numbers highlight the social importance warfare and fortifications played in the development of cultural identities. M.H. Hansen broadly defined the concept of a city-state, or polis, as an institutionalized and centralized micro-state consisting of a defended town, its immediate hinterland, and a stratified society inhabiting it. (Hansen, 2000) Its origins lie in the need of small communities to unite as an answer to the mutual necessity of defense. Simple raids into enemy territory were a main characteristic of early warfare and these tactics resulted in the establishment of small enclosures where people and their movable possessions found temporary refuge. These safe havens may not have featured fortifications, relying instead on the natural strength of a position to discourage direct assaults and the grouping of people to neutralize the potential of surprise attacks and enhance overall security. (Anon, n.d.) Dominant patterns of warfare-whether seasonal or year-round affairs, whether conducted by raiding parties or complex armies-influenced settlement location. In turn, the development of the settlement was contingent on its location for the survival capabilities it offered and the contacts it could uphold with the outside world. (Anon, n.d.) The danger outside aggression posed was a principal reason that led communities to build defenses, but banditry and wild animals also posed threats that led to the construction of defenses. (Anon, n.d.) In this context fortifications also formed an essential psychological barrier protecting the community. The presence of dangerous wild-animal species within the perimeter of the city was also particularly inauspicious. For example, the spotting of a wild wolf within the walled circuit was one of the worst omens that could befall Rome or a Roman city. Wolves symbolized savage uncontrolled spaces and related to death and war. Their entry into the civilized space of the city also was an affront to its protective gods and symbolized the invasion of uncontrolled forces into the world controlled by men. (Anon, n.d.) Similarly, fortifications also kept out unwanted elements such as bandits, robbers, and thieves, or the outside 'other', that did not belong to the community. As outcasts they often lived in the countryside outside of the confines of the city. As a result, city walls also defined control exercised within their confines and the territory associated with the city, as opposed to the outside chaos that threatened the community. In short, they marked the symbolic boundary of the civilized versus the uncivilized. (Anon, n.d.) Beyond looming external threats, internal social, economic, and political factors influenced the construction of fortifications. Communities decided to build fortifications either in response to a direct threat, or if they gained enough wealth to construct them in (Anon, n.d.) Rowlands, \"Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements,\" 454. (Anon, n.d.) Rowlands, \"Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements,\" 453. (Anon, n.d.) On the matter see J. Trinquier, \"Les loups sont entrés dans la ville: De la peur du loup a la hantise de la cité ensauvagée.\" In Les espaces du sauvage dans le monde antique: Approches et définitions (Franche-Comté, 2004), (Anon, n.d.) E. Salomon, Roman Colonization under the Republic (New York, 1970), 17. anticipation of any future trouble. (Anon, n.d.) Strongholds and refuges sometimes evolved into cities and towns. Whether or not they became urbanized, the presence of strongholds also entailed a degree of social control. Troop concentrations within their confines could contain revolts from fortified positions or move quickly into the surrounding territory. When applied to foreign politics this tactic featured the deliberate implantation of colonies inside enemy territory in order to force acceptance of a dominating culture. Because internal politics in particular played a role in the design of fortifications, several different types of government may be evident in a specific region. Recently, scholars who have built upon Aristotelian ideas have characterized fortification types and defensive tactics according to social structures. (Anon, n.d.) For example, small fortified enclosures scattered throughout a territory may signal an effort to defend the property of an elite landowning class, whereas defenses sheltering a community, as opposed to a settlement surrounding a fortified center, may reflect a preoccupation with defending the population, suggesting a somewhat more egalitarian society. (Anon, n.d.) It seems evident, therefore, that fortifications afforded a measure of social and even economic control. In fact, one of their most important aspects is their role as formalized filtering points between the city, its countryside, and any imported or exported goods. Gates in particular also functioned as toll points where authorities could tax those entering and exiting the city. They were, in a sense, checkpoints controlling movement of 25 G.

As the empire grew and commerce became more important, the design of gates also changed with distinct pedestrian and cart entrances designed to ease some of the congestion. These circumstances led to city gates becoming formal policing elements reflecting the authority of the state regulating the entrance into the city. (Palmer et al., 1980) Roman law highlights the importance of this function for the city gates. It defined the fortifications as res sanctae or holy things protected by the gods. Those who crossed or scaled the walls illegally committed a sacrilege against the gods punishable by death. (Anon, 1966) To a certain extent this law prevented illegal smuggling activities, but it also connected to a very real religious association with fortifications. The religious factor on the Italian peninsula is one which stems from Etruscan urban foundation rituals, later adopted by the Romans, which defined the sacred boundary, or pomerium, of the city. As we shall see, its character, extent, and even existence for Pompeii is still unclear, due primarily to the relatively unknown character of the early city. Although these elements influenced the development of fortifications, warfare and siege techniques remained the primary factors dictating their design. A number of ancient authors are the primary sources for the fundamentals of offensive and defensive siege tactics, and fortification design. Philon of Byzantium, Vitruvius, and Apollodorus Mechanicus are the chief sources concerning the architectural design of fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) Starting with Philon their collective writings span from the Hellenistic Age to the height of the Roman Empire with scholars equating Apollodorus Mechanicus to the illustrious architect Apollodorus of Damascus working under Trajan. Philon and Apollodorus in particular include extensive discussions on weaponry and siege tactics; whereas Vitruvius engages primarily in describing the construction of proper defenses. Aineias the Tactician, also known as Aineias Tacticus, is a more mysterious figure who remains unidentified beyond his name. His treatise on how to survive a siege relates to the practicalities and tactics that small cities needed to adopt to prepare for and endure through a long siege. (Anon, n.d.) Ancient accounts concerning the attack and defense of cities are also useful resources but are too numerous to mention here. They could be the object of their own separate book. Nevertheless, the contributions by Lawrence, and more recently Camporeale, offer significant starting points on the matter. (Anon, n.d.) The recognition that warfare and defense were crucial factors in the development of the community is a relatively recent approach; regional studies of defensive systems and fortifications remain underrepresented. This is particularly the case for the area of ancient Samnium, home of the Samnites, who are crucial to the development of Pompeii. In fact, with the exception of S.P. Oakley's survey of hill-forts, few publications treat Samnite fortifications extensively. (Anon, n.d.) This focus on hill-forts is useful, and the result of the scattered nature of the Samnite occupation of the Apennine Mountains. However, it does not capture the intricacies associated with siege warfare and the design of Hellenistic Apollodorus.

As a result, this study relies heavily on the better-published Roman, Etruscan, and Greek fortifications as a point of departure since the region of Campania was also a cross-road for all these cultures. Since there are few studies of the subject of fortifications on the Italian peninsula, the surveys on Greek fortifications published by F.E Winter and A.W. Lawrence are fundamental. (Anon, n.d.) Marion Blake and Giuseppe Lugli, writing in the 1940s and 1950s, were pioneers on the subject in Italy; their studies only included fortifications in wider surveys of Roman construction techniques. (Anon, n.d.) They primarily considered Roman fortifications and mentioned earlier Etruscan walls only when they formed a direct predecessor to later techniques. In the late 1980s Gunnar Brands conducted extensive research into the existing remains of Republican fortifications in Italy, completing a catalogue that still forms a useful departure point for further investigations. (Anon, n.d.) In 1995 Martin Miller revised Lugli's preliminary typological assessment for central Italian fortifications and included a large section on Etruscan defenses in his work. (Anon, n.d.) Since then scholarship has started to pay more attention to the role of fortifications in Italy with a recent volume of conference proceedings dedicated to the Etruscan fortified city. (Anon, n.d.) The research on walls as representational elements focuses primarily on the late Republic and the Augustan urban renewal programs sweeping the Italian peninsula. Much of it stems from the initial research conducted in the first decades of the 1900s on the grand remains of Augustan-age gates still to be seen in many Italian cities including (Anon, n.d.)

Torino, Spello, Fano, and Rimini to name a few. (Anon, n.d.) This initial work inspired generations of future scholars on the subject, including illustrious names such as Pierre Gros and Fernando Rebecchi. The focus the Augustan Age has led to the publication of the proceedings of a period specific conference dedicated to the fortifications of Italy and the Roman west. (Colin, 1987) Guido Rosada subsequently considered the subject for northern Italy with two articles published in 1990. (Rosada, 1990) Most recently, Isobel Pinder has tackled the task of synthesizing the most important aspects of scholarship regarding Roman city walls, producing what already is a seminal article on the subject of Roman fortifications. (Pinder, 2011) For the Republican period much of the research flows from Emanuele Gabba's seminal article on municipal construction written in the early 1970s and Helene Jouffroy's subsequent extensive catalogue of public buildings. (Gabba, 1972) Their work emphasized the value of fortifications as part of the essential architectural elements defining a city. In the late Republic magistrates across the Italian peninsula embarked on programs to construct or refurbish defenses to such an extent that the construction of walls was second only to the building of temples. Two factors prompted this development: the general insecurity of the Republic, and an explicit process of acculturation between local and Roman elements. At the turn of the first century BCE Rome struggled against the Cimbri and Teutones in northern Italy. As Adrian Goldsworthy points out, this was a costly war. The conflict wiped out at least five consular armies, and induced the Romans to carry out the last known human sacrifice in their history, burying alive a Greek and a Gallic couple in the Forum Boarium. (Anon, n.d.) At the time the Romans perceived the threat that these tribes posed to be almost as serious as Hannibal's invasion of Italy. (Anon, 2003) After the war the unrest continued almost unabated into the conflicts of the Social War and the dying Republic. This period of continued crisis likely stimulated the construction of fortifications in Italy. Nevertheless, city walls were also elements of a distinct urbanization process and were part of the collection of public buildings that allowed a community to call itself a city. Most recently, Jeffery Becker expanded this concept in a dissertation that defines the role of fortifications as part of essential civic architecture during Rome's expansion into central Italy. (Anon, 2007) Perhaps Paul Zanker best described the role of city walls as part of the imposition of Roman elements. Like villas, centuriation, road construction, sanctuaries, and tombs, city walls were essential components defining order and urbanism. (Zanker, 1998) Within this process of acculturation city walls completed the urban image-almost as a crown. (Anon, n.d.) Plutarch Roman Questions 83 The fortifications of Pompeii have played an important part in the modern scholarship on the urban definition of the city. Before diving into the complexities of how these fortifications functioned in antiquity we need to first define the major theories concerning their genesis and influence on the city's layout. Until recently, the excavations of Pompeii have focused on recovering the city as it was, frozen in 79 CE. The city walls, however, due to their size, relative lack of ornament, and their instrumental role anchoring the street layout were one of the few monuments upon which excavations could shed light on the genesis of the city without disrupting the exposed ruins. Furthermore, the walls, and in particular gates such as the Porta Ercolano, have remained exposed ever since their first discovery in the late 1700's, influencing the views of countless visitors and scholars of antiquity. As a result, scholars have long contemplated the fortifications and they have produced many divergent theories concerning the development of Pompeii. Yet, despite the importance of Pompeii's fortifications, no general summary of their recovery exists and we know relatively little about their state of preservation after their first excavation. This chapter provides a background tracing the main excavations and problems concerning the walls; it also highlights the principal theories connecting the fortifications with the history of the city. We will keep these theories in mind in subsequent chapters, but we should remember that without further evidence and excavations many of the hypotheses remain open to further debates. Before examining the history of the excavations we need to define some of the most prominent hypotheses advanced over the decades concerning the development of Pompeii. The complexity of this debate is primarily the result of our lack of fundamental knowledge of the early city. In fact, with only two percent of Pompeii excavated below the level of 79 CE, the various theories remain highly speculative and susceptible to future changes. (Anon, n.d.) Many hypotheses rest on the dates and sequencing of the fortifications because it was the walls that anchored the major arteries of the city; they represent the first tangible signs of an organized community preoccupied with defense. The debate concerning the urban development essentially divides into two main camps; those favoring a grand central design of the city, and those who see it growing from an old core also known as the Altstadt. The original nineteenth century hypothesis envisioned the city enclosed by the limestone fortification and founded in a single coherent urban design in the sixth century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) Also known as the grand Pompeii theory, the dynamics of such a massive single foundation were daunting and a few scholars hypothesized a slightly more nuanced development. Giuseppe Fiorelli and Antonio Sogliano speculated on the presence of a previous circuit suggesting that a fossa-agger system first defended the city. They envisioned a simple wooden palisade standing on an earthen embankment protected by a forward ditch which fully enclosed the plateau. Sogliano in particular also suggested that an early version of the Porta Ercolano opened on the western end of the via di Nola, basing his hypothesis on the logical observation that it lay directly opposite the Porta Nola in an orthogonal plan. (Sogliano, 1918) Maiuri discredited his theory, but Hans Eschebach recently claimed to have identified its remains beneath the House of Fabius Rufus (VII.16.22). (Anon, n.d.) This scholarly debate, spanning many decades, exemplifies the complexity of the theories concerning the city walls and the urban development of the city. In fact, in light of the discovery of the pappamonte wall many decades later, Sogliano's conclusions were not that far from the mark. In 1913 Haverfield proposed a new model suggesting that Pompeii first developed around a smaller core centered on the Forum and preserved in the irregular layout of the streets in the southwestern corner of the city. (Anon, 1913) A few decades later, Armin von Gerkan elaborated the theory further. He identified the vicolo dei Soprastanti, the via degli Augustali, the vicolo del Lupanare, and the via dei Teatri as the limits of the Altstadt (fig. 6). (Anon, 1940) The circuit suggested by the streets, he argued, followed the path of a fortified agger. It included gates opening on important roads that became the major arteries of the city when it expanded into the confines of the orthostate wall. Eschebach later refined the theory by identifying two phases of development for the Altstadt. The first settlement developed as an urbs-quadrata, or squared city, centered on the later Forum, with four neighborhoods radiating out on each side. In a second phase this core gradually expanded into the limits Haverfield and Von Gerkan identified. Eschebach based his theory on Maiuri's discovery of a hypogeum beneath the Terme Stabiane. He argued that it was an Etruscan tomb which, given the traditions forbidding burials within the city limits, suggested that it was once outside the city walls. He also projected an earlier fortification defending the urbs-quadrata after excavations identified the remains of a robbed out wall in the vicolo del Lupanare. Eschebach argued for a third phase in which a planned vigorous expansion of urban development in the fifth century BCE led to the current layout of the city. (Anon, 1970) Soon afterward British architectural historian John Ward-Perkins criticized the model, dismissing the urbs-quadrata and projecting a well ordered gradual expansion of Pompeii from the Altstadt nucleus. (Ward-Perkins et al., 1978) The Altstadt theory, in its various nuances, dominated the hypotheses concerning the development of early Pompeii until Stefano De Caro dated the pappamonte wall to the sixth century BCE. He essentially returned to the idea of a grand foundation. (Caro, 1985) However, the new theory did not dispense with the Altstadt altogether. De Caro envisioned the fortification protecting a swath of wide open terrain surrounding a main habitation core. He admitted the uncertainty of assigning a separate chronology to the structures, and suggested the absence of an Altstadt fortification. Instead he envisioned a palisade, road, or drainage ditch to explain the preservation of the street layout. (Anon, n.d.) Since then, recent archaeological excavations in Regio VI have refined the Altstadt theory suggesting that it actually represents a retreat of the urban expanse into smaller, more defensible, confines in the fifth century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) The city gradually expanded back out protected by a new wall after Campania entered the Roman sphere of influence in the late fourth century BCE. The long debate surrounding the construction of the fortifications is primarily the result of their importance in the urban development of Pompeii. The history of their excavation is equally complex and accompanies the various theories visited above. Unfortunately the first discovery of the walls is mired in the murky history of the early digs when recording techniques and requirements were far less accurate than standard modern ones. As a result, much of the earliest archaeological evidence is lost. Some of it survives in fragments throughout the published excavation journals known collectively as the Pompeianorum Antiquitatem Historia, or PAH, written between 1748 and 1861. (Anon, n.d.) Although somewhat incomplete, this document provides precious insight into the excavation of the city walls. Nevertheless, the light it sheds on the current state of the fortifications is somewhat dim. Since a synthesis of the progress of the excavations is lacking, the following section offers a first review of the evidence. It is important since we can catch a glimpse of the state of the fortifications at the moment of their recovery, and highlight the important decisions that led the remains we see today. What emerges is a continuous presence of the city walls throughout the history of Pompeian excavations that inevitably helped shape modern perceptions of the city and its limits. (Anon, n.d.) G. Fiorelli, Pompeianarum Antiquitatum Historia, (Naples 1862). The organization of the Pompeianorum Antiquarium Historia is somewhat cumbersome. Volume one and two each divide into three parts (1-3 and 4-6) with separate page numbers. Volume 3 is a single volume. Hence forth the notes will contain the volume, part, page and date. See also A. Laidlaw, \"Mining the Early Published Sources: Problems and Pitfalls.\" In The World of Pompeii, edited by J.J. Dobbins and P. Foss (Hoboken, 2007), 620-621. The excavations first touched the walls uncovering the Porta Ercolano on the northwestern tip of the city. The PAH entry of September 17, 1763 mentions excavation work occurring near the \"...puerta de la cuidad\" suggesting that workers had already noted its presence. (Anon, n.d.) By September 15, 1764, excavators had tunneled their way to the exterior of the gate and starting on October 14 they proceeded to uncover its full structure. They employed a systematic top-down approach in one of the first recorded instances of the application of the method widely used today. (Anon, n.d.) Unfortunately, as is the case for much of the journals, the entries concentrate on the finds recovered during the excavations rather than describing any architectural remains or embellishments on the walls. A series of entries dating to 1769 mention the recovery of statue parts in the vicinity of the gate including pairs of heads, arms, and hands with missing fingers. They are the only hints of any sort of statuary that may have adorned the Porta Ercolano. With the pieces and context now lost the fragments may have belonged to any number of nearby tombs or buildings. (Anon, n.d.) The records remain equally patchy for the next decades of excavation. Entries in 1766 and 1768 briefly report the discovery of the city walls near the soldier quarters, now known as the quadriporticus, in an effort to chart their course. (Anon, n.d.) Subsequent years saw 60 PAH 1 pars prima, 153. See also G. Fiorelli, Descrizione di Pompeii (Naples, 1875), 75. He gives the following dates for the full excavation of the gate: Sept. 14-Oct. 12, 1763, April 1-July 12, 1764, and June 29-Nov. 11, 1769. The actual entries in the PAH are somewhat different and less precise in locating the excavation often describing the works occurring in and around the gate. For example the entry for the start of the final excavation of the gate is actually July 22, 1769, PAH 1 Pars Prima, 234. 61 PAH 1 Addenda B, 114, #15 September 14, 1764, describes the adoption of a top down approach. To my knowledge this is the first systematic employment of this method. (Anon, n.d.). Both Adams and Clark describe the recovery of fragments of bronze drapery nearby. They believed it belonged to a tutelary deity of the city set on a pedestal next to the gate. Unfortunately no further information exists. The pedestal, however, is likely the unfinished tomb on the north side in front of the gate. See W. Adams, The Buried Cities of Campania (London, 1873), 50; W. Clark, Pompei (Knight, 1831), (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) the gradual exposure of the fortifications on the north side of city as the excavations progressed in Regio VI. The precise connotation of the works remains vague and the fortifications are only mentioned in passing as part of the uncovering of larger sections of the city. (Anon, n.d.) In 1782 explorations started on the southern end of Pompeii, but the location remains rather vague with the reports signaling excavators working to find the fortifications near the Temple of Isis. (Anon, n.d.) The city walls are actually quite far from the temple and the area uncovered was probably near the quadriporticus. Andrea De Jorio, author of one of the earliest guidebooks on Pompeii, more specifically mentions excavations occurring in the area that year. 66 He describes the recovered remains as razed by earthquakes and re-used for their material, suggesting that he may be referring to the large demolished section of wall curtain west of the Porta Stabia. Entries between March 15 and May 3, 1787 describe the continued excavation of a trench around the city. They probably refer to the area east of the Porta Ercolano where diggers began their efforts. (Anon, n.d.) After this episode the sources fall silent, but excavations seem to continue under General Championnet during the short-lived Parthenopean Republic of 1799. For reasons that remain unclear the general was particularly interested in finding the gates of the city. By the end of the year excavators had found the top of the Porta Nola, and identified the remains of the Porta Sarno and Nocera. (Anon, n.d.) Up to this point the exposure of the walls was largely piecemeal. The policy changed radically when Queen Caroline Bonaparte (Murat) (Anon, n.d.) PAH 1 Pars Secunda, 14, Jan.2 -Jan. 9, 1783 describes work continuing on the city walls. PAH 1 Pars Secunda, 34 Nov. 16-30, 1786 work on the house of the vestals slows down to uncover the city walls. (Anon, n.d.) PAH 1 Pars Secunda, 13-14, Sept. 12 -Dec. 26 briefly mentions the walls south of the portico associated with the great theatre as excavated in 1782. 66 A. De Jorio, Plan de Pompei (Naples, 1828), 155. 67 PAH 1 Pars Secunda, 34, May 3, 1787. (Anon, n.d.) For the Porta Nola see L. García y García, Danni di guerra a Pompei (Rome, 2006), 166. For the Porta Sarno see PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 147, March 31, 1814. For the Porta Nocera see De Jorio, Plan de Pompei, 157. set out to find the entire circuit during the French occupation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies between 1808 and 1815. Her strategy was simple; chart the walls and gates so authorities could expropriate terrains within the perimeter and diggers could follow the ancient roads to better understand the urban layout. (E et al., 1812) Under the plan the fortifications would function again as a security perimeter to keep out thieves and looters from the site. (Anon, n.d.) Given the infancy of archaeology at the time the policy was quite innovative, but it also inadvertently set the stage for the modern perception that the enceinte marked a clear edge to the city, a notion that has changed only in recent decades. Authorities assigned groups of soldiers and some private contractors, including a certain Pirozzi, to the operation starting in 1810. (Anon, n.d.) The queen herself took an active interest in the excavations, often visiting the site to supervise progress and personally pay for the works. (Anon, n.d.) Understanding the development of these excavations is difficult; the entries in the journals remain vague and the topography of Pompeii was still very unclear. Between August 1811 and May 1812 excavations concentrated on the stretch between the Porta Nola and Ercolano where they uncovered the unspecified remains of four towers and one destroyed gate. The four towers mentioned could be any of five, numbers VII-XII, now known in this area, and the gate in question most likely is the Porta Vesuvio. (Anon, n.d.) Between September 6, 1811 and September 12, 1812 work continued on the excavation of the houses in Regio VI and included digging a narrow trench to reach the level of 79 CE on the field-side of the walls. (Anon, n.d.) On October 5, 1812 groups of soldiers started uncovering the walls on the east side of the city in three different unspecified locations. (Anon, n.d.) De Jorio reports on a concentrated effort near the amphitheater between May 1812 and June 1813. It exposed three towers and a gate, presumably the Porta Sarno and Towers V, VI, and VII. (Anon, n.d.) The PAH offers a slightly different version of the events and describes the diggers reaching the Porta Sarno on March 31, 1814 and exposing it by 5 May. (Anon, n.d.) Curiously, these entries omit the towers, detailing instead the discovery of posterns perhaps as a reference to their doors. To the north, the PAH first mentions the Porta Nola as new gate on May 8, 1813 despite the earlier identification of the gate under General Championnet. (Anon, n.d.) Work progressed rapidly and 5 June marks the recovery of the inscription and keystone of the arch. (Anon, n.d.) By 9 September, with much of the gate uncovered, the digging changed focus to follow the via di Nola into the city. (Anon, n.d.) Work near the amphitheater turned west after reaching Tower V and fully uncovered the Porta Nocera by February 1815. The events are again murky. De Jorio reports the discovery of four towers and a gate in the area spanning the amphitheater and the quadriporticus between April 1813 and September 1814. (Anon, n.d.) The number of towers is 74 PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 69, Oct. 26, 1811. Also PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 85, June 13, 1812. 75 PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 96, Oct. 15, 1812. 76 De Jorio, Plan de Pompei, 155. 77 PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 149, May 5, 1814 149. De Jorio, Plan de Pompei 155, diverges a little reporting the time span between May 1812 and June 1813. 78 PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 110, May 8, 1813. The full identification is a fact by May 29, 1813. See PAH 1 Addenda e Schedis Petri La Vega et Michele Arditi, 269. De Jorio, Plan de Pompei, 155 mentions May 1812. 79 PAH 1 Pars Tertia,113, June 5, 1813. 80 PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 127, Sept. 9, 1813. 81 De Jorio, Plan de Pompei, 155. slightly odd considering we now know of Towers IV, III and II, in this section, but he may have included Tower V in his count. He describes the Porta Nocera, a structure Championnet had already identified in 1799, as largely excavated by the end of 1814. (Anon, n.d.) The PAH, however, mentions the first indications of the gate on January 12, 1815 after excavators uncovered the road leading up to it. Reports dating to roughly a month later confirm the full exposure of the Porta Nocera, noting that much of it lay ruined. (Anon, n.d.) Efforts subsequently moved back to the northern section of the fortifications to find the Porta Vesuvio. The degree of this campaign's success remains unclear, but excavations stopped on March 12, 1815 when worker gangs moved to uncover the amphitheater. (Anon, n.d.) Only the entries of January 16 and 23, 1819 mention a renewed effort to unite two wall sections uncovered in the northern section, but the precise location is unclear. (Anon, n.d.) By the time the digging officially ceased on April 30, 1815, the operation had uncovered two-thirds of the circuit, 86 including at least five city gates and an unspecified number of towers. Beyond the individual exposure of the larger structures, however, the work was largely superficial, only occasionally reaching the level of 79 CE. (Anon, n.d.) With much of the circuit's course known, further operations languished. A slow inexorable process began where many sections were abandoned and backfilled with the massive piles of dirt, known as the cumuli borbonici, coming from excavations elsewhere in the city. (Anon, n.d.) A significant gap exists between what the excavations actually uncovered and what we see today. None of the reports mention any sort of embellishments on the walls, 82 De Jorio, Plan de Pompei, 157. 83 PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 169, Feb. 2-9, 1815. 84 PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 170-172, Feb. 12, 16, March 8, 1815. 85 PAH 2, Pars Quarta, 1, January 16-23 1819. 86 PAH 1 Addenda e Schedis Petri La Vega et Michele Arditi, 275. 87 PAH 1 Pars Tertia, 148, April 17 th 1814. 88 See A. Maiuri, \"Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano.\" Notizie degli scavi di antichità 22 (1943): 275. although the current remains still display patchy stucco revetment on the towers and gates. Sadly, much of it is gone after succumbing to its initial exposure to the elements in the 1800s. We can only speculate on the amount preserved at the time of discovery. (Anon, n.d.) Despite the extensive recovery of the walls, two of the seven gates remained unknown. Excavations began at the Porta Stabia on April 22, 1851, and the entry of 10 June first describes its discovery. Roughly nine months later the work ended with a large part of the structure exposed to its current level. (Anon, n.d.) It subsequently gained most of its scholarly notoriety because of the debate on the translation of an Oscan inscription found in the gate court. The discussion need not concern us much. It centered mainly on reading the actual lettering present on the stone and its accurate translation (fig. 7). (Anon, n.d.) The exterior edge of the gate remained unexcavated until 1853 when Giulio Minervini, seeking to publish a full plan, dug a tunnel to find the exterior corner of the eastern bastion. (Anon, n.d.) Only in the last decades of the 1800s did excavations resume to further expose the area in front of the gate. Across the city, the Porta Marina was the last unknown gate and Giuseppe Fiorelli began targeting the area on March 5, 1861. A previous campaign had detected it in 1844 as part of a project to provide a new entrance to the ruins, but had otherwise left (Anon, n.d.) There are many descriptions of rain water and particularly ice causing large sections of frescos and stucco to detach from buildings. For an example see Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi partie 1 (Paris, 1824), 44. (Anon, n.d.) it buried. (Maiuri, 1960) A month after the operation began workers had fully defined the gate. The reports mostly describe the recovery of an outer niche holding the fragments of a statue of Minerva. No further information exists on the excavation work. (Anon, n.d.) Starting in February 1898 Antonio Sogliano resumed the excavations of the northern fortifications in an effort to fully expose Tower X. His aim was to better understand the construction sequence of the walls and tie it into the development of the city. Amongst his most important discoveries was a graffito mentioning Sulla scratched on the stucco of the first window on the right of the tower (fig. 8). Sogliano identified a victorious soldier as its maker who carved it, he believed, in honor of the Roman dictator. Certainly no direct proof for this association exists, but Scholars have since used it to date the construction of the tower to before Sulla's siege and conquest of the city. (5385 & Sogliano, 1898) The operation also cleared the curtain wall between Towers X and XI, and had finished exposing Tower XII by late August 1901. (Sogliano, 1901) In 1906 Sogliano returned to investigate the agger south and west of Tower XI, but he abandoned the excavations soon thereafter and never published the results of his work. (Sogliano, 1929) In 1902 efforts also shifted to the nearby Porta Vesuvio since its full extent and plan remained unknown. Predictably, the recovery of the water castellum next to the gate generated the most interest. (Also & Paribeni, 1902) Sogliano published a brief report on the gate in 1906 that included the only description of since disintegrated frescoes associated with two altars recovered on the forward bastion. (Sogliano, 1906) Excavations continued intermittently in front of the gate until 1910 when Spano published and described the tombs currently visible in the area. (Spano, 1910) Following these sporadic and isolated campaigns, Amedeo Maiuri conducted the most systematic excavations to date between May 1926 and October 1927. He understood the unique importance of the fortifications and their capacity to shed light on the early history of Pompeii. The extensive publication of 1929 still remains a fundamental starting point for any serious investigations into the walls of Pompeii. (Maiuri, 1929) The campaign included trenches at the Porta Stabia, Nola, Vesuvio, Ercolano, and the systematic exploration of Tower XI. Maiuri's excavations revealed the orthostate wall and furnished detailed evidence on the walls and gates that allowed him to formulate the construction sequence largely still accepted today. (Anon, n.d.) He subsequently made the recovery of the abandoned and reburied fortifications his personal quest. He extended his excavations of the Palestra in the 1930s to include the adjacent fortifications between Tower III and the amphitheater. Amongst the most important finds, although he never elaborated on the discovery, was the identification of the pappamonte fortification and the recognition that it predated the orthostate wall. (Anon, 1939) He next focused on re-excavating the walls between the Porta Vesuvio and Ercolano, publishing the results in 1943. Much of the original trench dug to find the walls had collapsed and, along with the debris from the excavations of the city, had re-buried most of the walls. (Anon, n.d.) These circumstances were true for much of the circuit. They explain the reliance of late-nineteenth-century Pompeianists, such as Johannes Overbeck and August Mau, on the drawings and reconstructions of the French architect François Mazois published several decades earlier. (Anon, n.d.) As detailed further in chapter four, this forced blind reliance led to a series of common misconceptions especially regarding the layout of towers and their decorations. Maiuri's investigations corrected these views and reached two important conclusions; a new, more elaborate reconstruction of the towers and the identification of two fills in front of the walls. They indicate interventions on the fortifications that occurred in the early Imperial and post-earthquake periods. (Anon, n.d.) By the 1950s Maiuri devised a systematic plan to free the city from the masses of excavation backfill by selling it for the construction of the new Napoli-Salerno highway and the leveling out of many nearby agricultural fields. The operation included uncovering most of the southern fortifications spanning the insula occidentalis and the Porta Sarno. This was no small feat, resulting in the removal of millions of tons earth. From it emerged a better view of the Porta Marina and the southwestern quarter of the city; it also proved the existence of the Porta Nocera, which many scholars doubted (fig. 9). (Anon, n.d.) The scale of this operation hints at just how much the fortifications had disappeared since their initial excavation and with them the certainty of the existence of entire gates such as the Porta Nocera. Much of the walls exposed today are a result of this (Anon, n.d.) The extent of this reburial is evident in a quick comparison between illustrations in the publications of the early 1800s and photographs published at the turn of the century. In this period the section went from largely exposed to almost completely re-buried. In particular compare W. Gell and J. P. Gandy, Pompeiana: The Topography, Edifices, and Ornaments of (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) J. Overbeck and A. Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken (Leipzig, 1884), 52. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano,\" 275-294. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Sterro dei cumuli e isolamento della cinta murale\" 166-179. effort, but some areas, including the stretch between the Porta Stabia and Tower II, and the environs of Tower IX, remain buried under the debris. (Anon, n.d.) Unfortunately, the monumental task produced only a small publication and much of the state of the walls at the time of their recovery remains little understood. (Anon, n.d.) In the 1980s the excavations resumed, targeting two separate sections of the walls. agger to the late fourth/early third century BCE, the date most scholars currently accept. These results also pushed the construction of the orthostate wall to before the fifth century BCE because, she argued, this was the most plausible length of time for its existence between the construction of the pappamonte and the limestone fortifications. The full excavation of Tower VIII was another major contribution of this campaign, producing rare decorative elements similar to those of Tower X and fragments of an inscription. (Anon, n.d.) Between 1993 and 2002 the Japanese Institute of Paleological Studies conducted a study to establish the existence of the Porta Capua on the northeast side of town. The excavations of the 1800s had detected a structure, but, just as had been the case with the Porta Nocera, scholars remained divided on its nature and even its very existence. The importance of assessing the presence of the gate correlated to the orthogonal layout of the city and its urban development. For example Fiorelli, a firm believer in the existence of a Porta Capua, defined it as a counterpart to the Porta Nocera and projected a street axis between the two. Although subsequent excavations proved a different layout, the theory led Fiorelli to divide the city into the administrative regions, or regiones, still used today. (Anon, n.d.) The Japanese team conclusively uncovered the remains of Tower IX rather than a gate and gathered further important results (fig. 10). (Anon, n.d.) Chief amongst these was the conclusion that the building and the adjacent curtain were reconstructed in the early colony, thereby disputing the generally accepted notion that all the opus incertum sections dated to the pre-colonial period. (Anon, n.d.) Other results pointed to the unique nature of the area. The agger was prominently absent, making this the only tower with a back door opening directly onto the street. The team also recovered evidence of a possible culvert beneath the foundations and traces of a defensive ditch that once extended in front of the building. Further results both confirmed and refuted parts of Maiuri's sequence. Deep excavations revealed traces of the pappamonte and orthostate walls, whereas the recovered materials confirmed an early third century BCE date for the limestone fortification. The absence of the agger, however, suggests that engineers re-used the inner face of orthostate wall as a terracing structure rather than replacing it with the elaborate internal wall built as part of the much later tufa reinforcement of the fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) These results significantly complicate Maiuri's strict phase separation according to construction techniques, and the notion of a uniform defensive line around the city. As we shall see, these issues have dominated and are still part of the scholarly debate, but only future systematic excavations can resolve them. Another important conclusion similarly confounds our understanding of the condition of the walls at the time of the eruption. The careful investigations of the Japanese Institute of Paleological Studies recovered a medieval occupation layer inside the tower that indicated a contemporary spoliation of the adjacent masonry for building material. Crow-bar marks identified at the Porta Sarno signal that a similar process occurred elsewhere along the circuit, but its extent and date remains unquantifiable. 116 114 H. Etani, Pompeii: report of the excavation at Porta Capua, 1993-2005, 208. The excavation team is still unsure what kind of structure it actually is but describes it as a culvert. It does however, predate the first tower. 115 S. Sakai, \"La storia sotto il suolo del 79 d.C. considerazioni sui dati provenienti dalle attività archeologiche svolte sulle fortificazioni di Pompei.\" Opuscula Pompeiana 10 (2000): (Anon, n.d.)(5385 & Sogliano, 1898)(Sogliano, 1901)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) Similar acts of spoliation may have occurred after the nineteenth century excavations and we once again find a problem in the general lack of documentation concerning the discovery and subsequent maintenance of the enceinte. The current remains include large sections of modern masonry built during twentieth century restoration campaigns, but records of these interventions are practically nonexistent. In some instances, such as the three towers on the north side of the city, a line of red bricks marks the distinction between modern and ancient masonry. In other occasions the masonry contains a plaque highlighting a restored section. One example in particular, still encased in the masonry, announces a repair to the curtain wall west of Tower X after a bomb demolished it during the allied air raid of 1943. No plaque, however, commemorates the reconstruction of the outer façade of Porta Marina obliterated during the same bombing. Here the restoration deliberately attempted to conceal any evidence of the event (fig. 11). (Anon, n.d.) We can only assume that the masonry is reconstructed accurately. Without markers it is generally up to the viewer to distinguish between modern and ancient masonry whether by visual analysis, the image archives, or both. Returning to the excavation campaigns, a series of more targeted interventions have explored the fortifications in recent years. The PARPS project, run by The University of Cincinnati, has excavated at the Porta Stabia as part of a wider investigation into the nearby urban layout. Important conclusions include the identification of four distinct phases and the discovery of a buried altar beneath two superimposed niches cut into the eastern gate court wall. The altar and lower niche belong to the first two phases of the structure but their dates are inconclusive. Two later phases included the (Anon, n.d.) See García y García, Danni di guerra a Pompei, 167-171. construction of the opus incertum vault in the early colony and a final raising of the sidewalk. (Devore & Ellis, 2008) The late date of the vault in particular is important as it again counters the generally accepted view that these structures all represent pre-colonial construction events. Two more targeted excavations investigated the Porta Vesuvio on the opposite end of the via Stabiana and the Temple of Venus near the Porta Marina. Results at the Porta Vesuvio confirmed Maiuri's sequence, including the succession of the limestone and tufa phases, dating them each to the early third and mid-second century BCE. (Seiler et al., 2005) The investigations also put to rest a longstanding debate conclusively proving that the inner opus incertum vault never existed for this gate. Unlike the other gates the Porta Vesuvio featured a vault on the exterior field side. Many scholars still date its construction to after the 62 CE earthquake, but the new results suggest its possible contemporaneity with the towers. (Maiuri, 1932) The most recent investigation of the fortified perimeter occurred in the precinct of the Temple of Venus in the southwest corner of the city. Pappamonte blocks recovered in the area probably doubled as fortification and terracing structures that preceded similar structures in tufa. (Curti, 2006) Although large parts of the fortifications were excavated and re-buried in sometimes unclear cycles, some of the gates have remained open to view ever since their first discovery. As a result they have played important roles in the accessibility to the site and modern perceptions of the ruins. The Porta Ercolano in particular formed the main access to the ruins for much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, greeting the distinguished members of the European elite and artists engaged in the grand tour. The importance of the gate in the vision of Pompeii and antiquity is considerable. Francesco Piranesi produced the first engravings of the area and the copies quickly spread throughout Europe, appearing in many descriptions and prints of the period. (Anon, n.d.) Early guide books and scholarly accounts almost invariably contain descriptions and illustrations of the fortifications. They often form the only evidence on the actual state of the walls, providing precious insight into any embellishments that have disappeared and the slow deterioration of the fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) The majority of these descriptions focus on the Porta Ercolano and the northern tract of the fortifications, whereas the Porta Nola, located further off the beaten track, received somewhat less attention. Other gates have played similar roles. As the excavations progressed, the fortifications slowly became psychological and physical barriers defining the city limit just as Caroline Bonaparte had intended. Today the walls continue to form a backdrop for visitors and, perhaps most importantly, they still help shape the concept of the limit of Pompeii as defined by the line of its defenses. \"…Fortifications represent by far the greatest physical expression of public, communal participation, whether we think in terms of money, labour, or organization… …Here, then, is the basic picture of a Classical polis, a critical mass of population and a fortified site. All the rest is window-dressing.\" As mentioned above, scholars tend to distinguish an early Pompeii spanning the Archaic and Early Classical periods. This period of urban genesis was critical to the creation of a strong local communal identity that translated into the stability of a longterm settlement capable of surviving up to the eruption of 79 CE. Since much of this early city is unknown, the nature of the evidence forces a primarily archaeological approach to define how the fortifications interacted with the settlement to create a unified appearance. This approach forms an undercurrent in later chapters where other types of evidence, such as social structure and artistic production, will help reframe our discussion on the role of the fortifications. Throughout the various periods, however, it is important to remember that all these factors continuously played important roles in the definition of the city and its identity. Recent archaeological discoveries have shed more light on the oldest and most enigmatic period of Pompeian history. Sporadic finds confirm a Neolithic presence on the plateau and a late Bronze/early Iron Age Palma Campania settlement in the area of the future Regio V and the Porta Nocera. (Anon, n.d.) Although future discoveries may change this picture, the choice of location is hardly coincidental. The area associated with Regio V is also the highest part of the Pompeian plateau and is particularly strategic. From here the settlement commanded the long natural valley forming an early coastal communication route through the region. It later accommodated the main decumanus of the city, known today as the via Stabiana. (Anon, n.d.) This phase seems to flicker out fairly quickly and a habitation hiatus follows lasting to the final decades of the seventh century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) The area of the Sarno Valley then experiences a shift in the occupation pattern where a number of smaller hamlets unite into larger settlements in a synoecistic movement creating new urban conglomerates. This development coincides with expanding trade routes to the east and the influence of the Etruscans spreading into Campania from the north. (Anon, n.d.) Evidence suggests that the settlers chose the area of the Altstadt, roughly coinciding with a small lava spur, for its naturally fortified southern, eastern, and western approaches. Excavations conducted in the area of the Triangular Forum uncovered evidence for buildings already occupying the area in the mid-seventh century BCE. Many remains are mostly simple postholes probably related to huts, whereas other more substantial foundations feature regularly spaced pappamonte blocks.foot_12 The success of the city depended primarily on its conformance to the rules governing the choice of its location. Ideal sites required a healthy environment to sustain the population and ample arable land to retain a degree of self-sufficiency. (Anon, n.d.) A site also needed to lend itself to easy defense and provide refuge for the population in times of danger, whether natural or man-made. Ideally, approaches to the settlement should pass over somewhat difficult terrain to create strategic bottlenecks where small defensive units could fend off larger attacking forces. As a prerequisite to basic survival, the site needed a reliable source of water, preferably in form of natural springs, nearby rivers, or manmade collection cisterns and wells reaching aquifers deep in the ground. It also needed to be centrally located in relation to its territory. This way it could function as a strategic base to exercise rapid intervention over subjects and intruders, and provide a convenient commercial exchange centre. (Anon, n.d.) In many ways, early Pompeii fulfilled these prerequisites, guaranteeing the success of the initial settlement. During the sixth century BCE a new fortification enclosed an area that would define Pompeii for centuries to come. Its route ran along a natural ridge created by the edge of an ancient lava flow coming down form Vesuvius to the north (fig. 12). The extended ridge gave the settlement strong natural defenses on the south, west, and eastern sides. Only the northern approach, a gentle slope from the mountain, formed a weak spot. The enceinte encompassed the same topographic depression, dominated by the previous Palma Campania Settlement, linking the territory north of Vesuvius with the Sorrentine peninsula and the city of Nola. (Anon, n.d.) At the foot of the plateau the River Sarno flowed into the sea, further enhancing the strategic position of Pompeii as the harbor for the cities of Nocera and Nola further inland. (Anon, n.d.) Perched on top of the plateau, the new city dominated its immediate territory as a crucial fortified node. Its extensive views helped it control both land and sea-commerce, and provided early warning against territorial intruders and a place of refuge for the population of the countryside in times of danger. (Anon, n.d.) The visible remains of the pappamonte fortification are scant with one or two courses of highly weathered blocks, some 40-50 cm high and 75-100 cm long, surviving between the Porta Nocera and Tower III. (Anon, n.d.) They were likely exposed by the natural erosion that occurred in the area in antiquity. The shallow foundations and friable nature of the rock suggest that the wall could not have exceeded more than five or six courses in height. Excavations have recovered large sections of the wall in house I.5.4-5 near Porta Stabia, buried in the agger of Porta Nocera, Tower IX, the stretch between the Porta Vesuvio and Porta Ercolano, and the terrace of the Temple to Venus Pompeiana. (Anon, n.d.) De Caro argues that a strong terra battuta, or beaten earth, level recovered near the Porta Ercolano and the Porta Nocera suggests the presence of a small pomerial street running behind the wall facilitating communication along the perimeter of the city. (Anon, n.d.) In some areas the wall, if it did extend around the whole city, is still uncharted. Remains are notably missing near the Porta Nola, suggesting that the circuit ran slightly further west than the current fortifications (fig. 13). (Anon, n.d.) Similarly, the enceinte is unaccounted for in the area near the great theater. Guzzo suggests that the building, cut in typically Greek fashion into the natural rock, probably obliterated the remains, but the fortifications most likely ran along a portion of the ridge. (Anon, n.d.) As mentioned previously, it was not until De Caro's excavations in the 1980s that modern scholars recognized the importance of the pappamonte wall. Yet it was Maiuri's excavations that provided much of the early information concerning its course and layout. In particular, his discoveries point to a strong continuity in the location of the gates, and therefore, the urban layout of the city. Maiuri described the remains of two early gates; one at the Porta Vesuvio and another sealed beneath Tower XI. This layout suggests that the via di Mercurio once functioned as a main artery of the city and is now a fossil in the urban framework. (Anon, n.d.) The excavations of Tower IX confirmed Stefano De Caro's theory for an all-encompassing enceinte when they uncovered another long section of the fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) The remains were again minimal composed mostly of one or two courses on shallow foundations. (Anon, n.d.) The latest excavations at the Porta Vesuvio confirmed the small tracts of the enceinte that Maiuri recovered on the north side of the city (fig. 14). The work also discovered further substantial remains of the early gate including a possible small forward bastion that served as a clear predecessor to the current plan of Porta Vesuvio. (Anon, n.d.) Theories on the original appearance of the fortifications abound and are still debated. They range from projecting a single freestanding wall, to a low fortification with (Anon, n.d.) Guzzo, Pompei.

Seiler et.al, \"La regio VI insula 16 e la zona della porta Vesuvio,\" 224. two facing facades, and a terracing wall accommodating an earth embankment or a mudbrick superstructure, reaching some three meters high. (Anon, n.d.) Scholars have almost invariably assigned a limited defensive capability to all of the proposed reconstructions reinforcing the notion that the wall was more symbolic rather than military. This assessment seems rather narrow in its focus, and it is more likely that the defenses included both symbolic and military components. In fact, any of these structures could easily respond to the predominantly raiding type of warfare at the time, which precluded the need for elaborate defenses. Furthermore, the recovery of a road hugging the city side of the defenses suggests a concern to maintain an easy access route to rapidly meet any threats. (Anon, n.d.) In this framework, although unimpressive in height, its addition to Pompeii's impressive natural defenses actually created a formidable defensive line in tune with the military threats of period (fig. 15). The fortifications therefore responded to both symbolic and defensive needs to define the community. A further indicator of these factors is that the enceinte did not feature a uniform appearance around the city. Instead it probably responded to variations in the natural strength of the terrain. Furthermore, as is well attested in Greece, areas with increased visibility perhaps displayed more impressive fortifications designed to flaunt the city's wealth and status. 146 Fabrizio Pesando points out the discovery of a large stepped pappamonte wall just north of the Porta Marina near the House of Umbricus Scaurus (VII.16.15). It signals a large building or perhaps even a terracing structure at the city limits. (Anon, n.d.) Similarly Emanuele Curti, after excavating the precinct of the Temple of Venus Pompeiana, suggests that the pappamonte enceinte probably functioned primarily as a terracing structure on its southern side. Presumably the slope of the ridge was once gentler, and a terracing wall helped flatten out the area for the buildings above. (Anon, n.d.) It is here that we can further appreciate the symbolic value of the defenses. Such a terracing wall, placed high on the lava ridge, made for an impressive sight for anyone approaching the city from the south. As a defensive structure it not only claimed the plateau itself. It also symbolized an assertion of power over a wide swath of territory and the region rather than responding solely to military concerns. A similar concept resides in the materials used for its construction. Building techniques could implicitly tie a community to its territory. Technological innovations and the availability of local materials were influential factors affecting the manner of defense. The presence of large forests, for example, might encourage the extensive use of wood in fortifications, whereas an abundance of sedimentary soils could stimulate the use of mudbrick. The development of better tools and building techniques had a significant effect on the construction of stone enceintes as masons progressively acquired skills facilitating quarrying and stone dressing. (Anon, n.d.) For example, in Etruria the relatively soft volcanic tufa encouraged the use of ashlar masonry in the south, whereas the harder and irregular lime-and sandstones of the northern regions stimulated the use of polygonal techniques at sites such as Roselle, Cosa, and Populonia. (Anon, n.d.) Vitruvius, writing many centuries later, recommends the use of local materials for the construction of walls, and that engineers build them in such a fashion to last as long as possible. (Anon, n.d.) Well-built walls, therefore, also reflected the skills and technological achievement of local craftsmen and communities. We catch a glimpse of the wall construction process and its effect on the community in an account by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus concerning the fortifications of Syracuse. The walls of the Greek city are celebrated for their massive length and scale, but their appearance need not concern us here. More important is the episode of roughly 400 BCE when Dionysius I, the tyrant of the city, expanded the enceinte to include the strategic Epiploae plateau in anticipation of a war with Carthage he intended to begin. He mustered over sixty thousand free peasants and six thousand yokes of oxen from the surrounding countryside to build a section of wall some thirty stades in length. With one stade roughly measured at 180 meters, the total length of the wall built was about 5.4 km. Dionysius put a master-builder in charge of each stade and assigned six parties, each 200 men strong, to individually build a plethron length of wall, or roughly 30 meters, under the supervision of a mason. The remaining work force quarried and transported the stone. Dionysius incited the men with rewards and led by example, supervising and participating in the construction process. He inspired such zeal and competition in the builders that crews finished the entire fortification, including the towers and six gates, in just twenty days. 152 criticized such a linear approach.

Sic. 14.18 It is unclear if such concerted efforts were typical of the time, and we should keep in mind the historian probably recounts this particular episode because of the tyrant's notable and out of the ordinary achievement. In addition, the numbers Diodorus furnishes are unreliable and probably exaggerated since he wrote about the event roughly 350 years after it happened. Nevertheless, the episode tells us something about the labor organization on such massive projects and the division of its construction into distinct sections. It is also a vivid example of how the building process and its spectacle could foster a sense of community and legitimize the power of the commissioner. In fact, the historian describes how onlookers watched in wonder at the zeal and labor of so many people on a single project. The use of pappamonte in Pompeii suggests a similar localized construction process. A recent lithological examination of the material identified it as a soft sedimentary conglomerate of volcanic debris, or tufa, found almost exclusively in the area of the lower Sarno River. (Anon, n.d.) The type is soft and easy to quarry, but its friable nature precludes any sort of tall or strong wall construction suitable to later defensive developments. With most of the material quarried on site it directly tied the community with its territory. Aside from envisioning chief masons supervising small groups of workers assigned to individual sections, it is hard to assess who exactly built the wall. (Anon, n.d.) For example, we know that Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, actively employed poor citizens on public projects in order to keep them distracted from the affairs of state and prevent uprisings. (Anon, n.d.) This factor, however, remains unclear for Pompeii, but if the builders were citizens, such as was the case with the Syracusan fortifications, then their association with the community probably enhanced the symbolic value to the fortifications. In any event, given the scale of the construction process, it is clear that the localized effort likely fostered a strong sense of community and identification for the population who depended on the region's resources for survival. The materials and construction techniques composing the fortifications also feature in the public and private buildings of the settlement, thereby influencing the appearance of the city and its image. Along with the city walls, it is the sanctuaries that form the most tangible structures of early Pompeii. They are similarly remarkable for their continuity and longevity throughout much of its history. The Temple of Apollo is a case in point. An opus quadratum pappamonte temenos wall, now buried beneath the House of Tryptolemus (VII.7.5), attests that the area already functioned as a sacred space in the early years of the sixth century BCE. The temenos wall probably defined an open interior space including a single votive column and an altar dedicated to rituals. By the close of the century the area also featured an Italic-style temple with a high podium composed of pappamonte blocks and a superstructure built in perishable materials. (Anon, n.d.) The recovered terracotta acroteria are stylistically similar to others found in the area of southern Latium and Campania. They suggest that the temple carried a distinct Campanian type roof blending local and Etrusco-Italic elements mirroring the wider regional developments of the time. (Anon, n.d.) Pompeii preserves the remains of other sanctuaries dating to this period, but their character is less clear. The survival of a tufa column, immured unmoved into a later wall of the House of the Etruscan Column (VI.5.17), and the excavated remains of a possible associated altar indicate the presence of a sanctuary. This setup is conceptually similar to the earliest Temple of Apollo, and excavation results suggest that the two were contemporaneous. The area associated with the House of the Etruscan Column perhaps functioned as an open sacred grove dedicated to Jupiter inside the perimeter of the settlement, but the exact characteristics are elusive. (Anon, n.d.) Nearby, a Doric limestone column later incorporated into a wall near the intersection of the via di Nola and the via Stabiana probably denotes the remains of a similar sanctuary. This votive column is even more enigmatic, but its purposeful preservation suggests its continuing importance throughout the remainder of the history of the city. (Anon, n.d.) The southern edge of the Pompeian plateau preserves two of the most important sanctuaries of the city. The same excavations that recovered evidence of the early enceinte on the terrace of the Temple of Venus also uncovered pappamonte foundation walls belonging to earlier structures. Traces of large deposits of mudbrick recovered nearby are probably the remains of collapsed wall superstructures. (Anon, n.d.) These remains suggest that the area was an early sanctuary perhaps dedicated to the Samnite goddess Mefitis Fisica who is attested at the site in the second century BCE. As we shall see, the Romans transformed her cult into that of Venus Pompeiana in reference to her role as personal protectress of the Roman dictator Sulla, who conquered the city. (Anon, n.d.) The makeup of the early building and the sanctuary are elusive and will need further investigation. However, the foundation walls and the use of perishable materials suggest a design similar to that of the Temple of Apollo. Further east the temple dedicated to Athena/Hercules, built on the very edge of the Triangular Forum, was perhaps the most imposing landmark of early Pompeii. Mostly built using perishable materials, it included Doric capitals fashioned in local Sarno limestone and terracotta acroteria on the roof. Dating to c. 530 BCE, this building replaced an earlier wooden version built at the beginning of the century. (Anon, n.d.) Through a characteristic mixture of Greek and Italic architectural elements, the new temple displayed affinities with Temple B at Pyrgi and the Temple of Apollo Lycaeus at Metapontum. It received at least two refurbishments between the sixth century and the early decades of the fifth century BCE, suggesting its importance for the population of the city. (Anon, n.d.) Like the Temple of Mefitis, its location on the very tip of the high southern lava ridge was a defining element of Pompeii and it acted as a beacon for those approaching from the Monti Lattari and the sea. (Anon, n.d.) New excavations throughout the city have recovered many other pappamonte blocks lined up as foundations for buildings above. Investigations in the House of Marcus Lucretius (IX, 3, 5.24) and the House of the Gladiators (V.5.3) produced some significant 161 I shall discuss her further in chapter 5. F.

They perhaps once functioned as part of houses, but the true character of these foundations is hard to assess since they supported completely lost mud brick or wattle and daub walls. (Anon, n.d.) As the recent discoveries in house I.1.1-10 and insula VIII.7 suggest, architects used pappamonte as a construction material well into the fourth century BCE, adding a further complicating factor to the reconstruction of early (Anon, n.d.) Nevertheless, results point to at least two basic types of foundation walls relative to this period. The most elusive are the shallow walls of roughly shaped, chipped or broken lava and limestone blocks that probably functioned as foundations for mudbrick walls. (Anon, n.d.) The second type features more regularly hewn rectangular pappamonte blocks that subdivide further into two distinct types. The first employs blocks laid down as headers with their long sides next to each other. The second uses the blocks as stretchers arranged longitudinally with meeting short sides. The first header type, recovered beneath Tower X, the Temple of Venus, and the Basilica, perhaps functioned as heavy terracing structures. The stretcher type perhaps supported freestanding walls or belonged to terracing structures in particularly flat areas, such as the vicinity of the Porta Nocera, (Anon, n.d.) The occupation levels related to these structures date to the sixth century BCE. See P. Castrén, R. Berg, and A. Tammisto, \"In the Heart of Pompeii.

The overall distinction suggests that the rough foundations supported fairly light structures, whereas the pappamonte blocks probably functioned as part of sturdier, well-developed walls. The appearance of such a plethora of archaic remains has led to a re-evaluation of De Caro's hypothesis concerning the wide empty spaces at Pompeii. This new theory, proposed after extensive excavations in Regio VI, sees a well-developed urbanized town in the sixth century BCE with a street pattern foreshadowing the later Hellenistic layout of the city. (Anon, n.d.) The very nature of these fragmentary remains calls into question the reliability of assigning all the recovered tracts along the perimeter of Pompeii to an actual continuous defensive structure. In fact, they may relate to individual buildings, or localized terracing structures. One thing to keep in mind for the period is that the unsophisticated tactics of siege warfare and the strength of strongholds usually led armies to avoid direct attacks on cities. When they did occur, sieges featured the widespread use of manual weapons; the basic armoury included spears, slingshots, and bows in both offensive and defensive operations. (Anon, n.d.) Settlements often depended on their nativa praesidia, or natural topographical contours, easily reinforced with local relatively simple defensive structures. (Anon, n.d.) Only the richest cities could afford full stone enceintes encompassing the entire settlement. As a result, these fortifications projected further associations of power and wealth upon the viewer. Poorer cities usually relied on simpler earthen ramparts (Anon, n.d.) Esposito, \"Un contributo allo studio di Pompei arcaica,\" 77. (Anon, n.d.) Coarelli and Pesando. \"The Urban Development of NW Pompeii: Archaic Period to 3rd C.

Boëthius, Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture (New Haven, 1978), 67 sometimes reinforced with stones or palisades and often built locally to strengthen a weak spot in the natural defenses. (Anon, n.d.) As a result, in contrast to De Caro's theory envisioning a settlement with open pastures and farming that were also useful in times of a siege, some scholars believe that fortifications primarily covered a large expanse of land primarily to use the natural contours more effectively. (Anon, n.d.) In reality the covered area of land probably functioned in both capacities, but these factors significantly complicate our understanding of early Pompeii. In fact, we know very little about the land use and the extent of the city's urbanization. Only further investigations into the nature of this early settlement can hope to further clarify the picture. In any event, the recovered remains of the pappamonte enceinte seem to follow a relatively consistent course around the city. They suggest a well-organized and relatively powerful settlement capable of mustering the resources to build it. Nevertheless, the overall picture is still very fragmented. Where Coarelli likes to see well-urbanized settlement, De Caro envisions a wide-open terrain with occasional buildings between the Altstadt and the outer fortification. (Anon, n.d.) Perhaps the real picture lies somewhere between the two. Paolo Carafa points out that many other excavations into the earliest strata of Pompeii have failed to reveal any traces of earlier structures, suggesting the open landscape advocated by De Caro. (Anon, n.d.) Pesando perhaps best describes it as an occupation \"…a macchia di leopardo\", or leopard spots, where the inequities of the terrain resulting from the lava flows composing the Pompeian plateau dictated the siting of private (Anon, n.d.) Lugli, La tecnica edilizia romana, 65. See also T. Cornell, \"Warfare and Urbanization in Roman Italy.\" In Urban Society in Roman Italy, edited by Timothy J. Cornell and Kathryn Lomas (London, 1995), 126-127. (Anon, n.d.) Boëthius, Etruscan and Early Roman Architecture, 67. (Anon, n.d.) Coarelli, \"Il settore nord-occidentale di Pompei,\" 174. De Caro \"Lo sviluppo urbanistico di Pompei,\" 72. (Anon, n.d.) Carafa, \"Recent Work on Early Pompeii,\" 65. dwellings. (Anon, n.d.) The city, therefore, extended beyond the Altstadt core, but its layout was somewhat patchy and much less homogenous than in later periods. Nevertheless, many of the main arteries accessing the city and large parts of the street network within the walls seem, by and large, already laid out. On the Italian peninsula the contemporary Etruscan settlements of Veii and Tarquinia supply a similar picture for a large but dispersed settlement within a wide enceinte, suggesting that this type of occupation was common in the period. (Anon, n.d.) All we can really say about this phase for Pompeii is that a consistent construction technique employed throughout the settlement directly or indirectly helped create a more unified appearance. In the late fifth century BCE Pompeii built a new wall replacing the old pappamonte fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) Scholars tend to identify its construction as the result of the Samnite conquest of Pompeii, or as a reaction to their rising threat from the hinterland. Archaeological evidence suggests that it closely followed the course of its earlier counterpart along the tactical ridge naturally defending the city. Maiuri uncovered substantial remains of the wall near the Porta Vesuvio, the Porta Ercolano, the Porta Stabia, and a long section between Towers III and IV (fig. 16). (Anon, n.d.) The recent excavations near Tower IX also recovered a section of the wall where it perhaps later changed function to a retaining wall for the subsequent Samnite fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) The new enceinte respected the previous gate openings, but their original appearance remains uncertain. In fact, not much of the wall remains. Maiuri postulates that the later Samnite fortifications largely demolished it and the blocks were re-used in various construction projects around the city. (Anon, n.d.) Like its predecessor, the orthostate wall is absent from the area of the Porta di Nola, and no trace has yet surfaced between the Porta Ercolano and the Triangular Forum. Two opposing walls, built using large slabs of a local yellow travertine known as Sarno limestone, composed the outer and inner façade of the fortification. An earth fill occupied the space between the two walls in a typically Greek military construction technique known as emplecton. (Anon, n.d.) The two faces stood on average some 4.30 meters apart. They rested on an almost negligible initial foundation course composed of horizontal slabs that supported a squat wall reaching only 6-7 meters high including the parapet. (Anon, n.d.) The retaining walls featured courses of flat stone slabs set vertically as orthostates. At approximately every third slab, builders inserted a header into the earth fill to stabilize the wall. Horizontal courses laid flat into the fill acted in a similar reinforcing role. The wall almost achieved a regular isodomic structure in a very elegant yet slightly irregular construction pattern of blocks quarried in varying sizes. Only Fritz Krischen, writing in 1941, attempted to reconstruct this phase based on Maiuri's data. His reconstruction shows a squat wall with merlons and the emplecton technique providing a wall-walk (fig. 17). Access stairs recovered near the gates were mostly narrow and steep ending against the parapet. This was a clear practical solution since the width of the wall did not allow for more than ten steps. A wider merlon was featured at the top of the steps to protect the soldiers heading up to the battlements. (Anon, n.d.) On the city side, a road known as a pomerial street closely shadowed the fortifications. It allowed for an easy communication route around the city. (Anon, n.d.) A ditch, or fossa, perhaps ran in front of the wall to increase its height. The emplecton construction technique led to a free-standing fortification that, along with the bright yellow Limestone employed, is a clear and abrupt departure from the earlier agger-like structure and dark grey coloring of the pappamonte wall. This shift is difficult to explain. As opposed to the pappamonte material quarried nearby the city, the limestone quarries were probably located relatively far away in the higher reaches of the Sarno valley. From there the material likely arrived at Pompeii by means of river barges transporting it downstream. (Anon, n.d.) This factor implies further aspects concerning Pompeii's territorial reach including its possible control and hegemony over the valley, or its close interaction with neighboring populations, or both. The extent and character of these relationships, however, remain difficult to quantify without further evidence, and a precise location for the quarries. Nevertheless, the organizational skill and technical expertise required to build the orthostate wall suggests a Hellenic influence. In fact, scholars view the emplecton construction technique as a typically Hellenic design, inducing some to identify this as a Greek period for (Anon, n.d.) This may suggest a strong bond between Pompeii and the neighboring Greek settlement of Neapolis. Although this theory remains hard to prove, the fortification represents a proud achievement prominently displayed around the city. Despite the considerable investment required in their construction, the new defenses herald a period of occupational hiatus, and possibly implosion, for Pompeii. The chronic lack of archaeological data leaves us in the dark about the city's character and appearance at this stage, but the start of the hiatus roughly coincides with the defeat of Etruscan forces by the Syracusan navy at the battle of Cuma in 474 BCE. (Anon, n.d.) With Etruscan influence waning Greek cities, such as Neapolis, Capua, and Cuma gained new prominence in the region. Soon afterwards a new Samnite threat materialized from the interior. The Samnites proved unstoppable, capturing Capua in 423 and Cuma in 421 BCE; this left only Neapolis as the sole, somewhat independent, Greek settlement. (Caro, 1991) The new status quo eventually created an Osco-Campanian society from the resultant interaction between the Samnites and the coastal population, but at Pompeii it led to large areas of the city languishing in abandonment. (Anon, n.d.) Excavations have identified a uniform abandonment stratum covering many pappamonte period buildings. It is particularly evident between the second half of the fifth and the first half of the fourth centuries BCE when important sanctuaries such as the Temple of Apollo also display an abrupt halt in votive materials. (Anon, n.d.) The reasons for its formation remain unclear. Fabrizio Pesando suggests that natural disasters, including flooding and mudflows, deposited the layer resulting in the subsequent abandonment of large areas of the city. Yet, the street layout probably remained much the same, suggesting some sort of urban cohesion. Such disparate results have led to a new theory hypothesizing a gradual retreat of the urban extent of Pompeii into the area of the Altstadt. (Anon, n.d.) The rate of this retreat is currently impossible to assess, but many of the previous pappamonte structures, including the Sanctuaries of Apollo and Mefitis, were probably standing when the orthostate wall was built. As opposed to the pappamonte fortification, the use of Sarno limestone and the new construction technique, at least initially, projected a distinct architectural contrast on the city, offering a renewed sense of security to its inhabitants and satellite communities. The messages it carried clearly distinguished the old pappamonte wall from the new fortifications and the patrons of their respective construction events. The fortifications may therefore also relate to a shift in the socio-political make-up or conquest of the city by a dominant group of outsiders intent on making a mark. Until recently the composition of the new Altstadt defenses remained unclear, with scholars hypothesizing an agger system protecting the nucleus. The evidence remains scant, but geophysical investigations at the House of the Postumii (VIII 4,4.49) suggest that an oblique gate, also known as a Scaean type, opened on the early via dell' Abbondanza (fig. 18). The discovery of wall remains built using both pappamonte and limestone blocks, and a possible external ditch suggest the presence of an agger-fossa system in the area. (Anon, n.d.) The recovered materials point to the sixth and fifth centuries BCE as a construction date, making it roughly contemporaneous to both the pappamonte and orthostate walls. (Dickmann & Pirson, 2002) Similar foundation blocks uncovered beneath the House of Mercury (VII.2.35) suggest the presence of an analogous fortification on the northern perimeter of the Altstadt. (Pedroni, 2011) A series of possibilities emerge regarding the relationship of this wall with the other outer enceintes. It may represent a secondary, inner, defensive line to either the pappamonte or orthostate walls, or both. Perhaps the Altstadt functioned primarily as a citadel or urban conglomerate, while the rest of the plateau remained open as a pasture and farm land. This image is actually more consistent with similar large settlements in Etruria and southern Italy. Cities such as Atri, Volterra, and Veii, to name a few, often divided up into a sacred fortified core, or arx, and an outer defensive perimeter. (Anon, n.d.) Other possibilities are that it served as an interim defensive system between the two outer defensive lines, or that it represents a defensive line built after a sudden contraction of the city. A period of significant urban regression inserts Pompeii into the wider trend of urban depopulation occurring in south-central Italy in the fifth century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) Although the information is patchy, Pompeii would continue to exist within the Altstadt until the construction of the following limestone enceinte in the late fourth century BCE. Interestingly excavations under the Eumachia building in the Forum have recovered foundations built using both pappamonte and limestone blocks belonging to a row of shops dating to the middle of the fourth century BCE. (Anon, 1973) The construction technique is similar to the Altstadt walls uncovered nearby and, as is the case with the pappamonte fortifications, its uniform application suggests a consistent image for the city. Significant questions remain as to who exactly founded and inhabited early Pompeii. Historically Strabo identifies the peoples successively occupying the city as the Oscans, Thyrrenians (Etruscans), Pelasgians, Samnites, and finally the Romans. (Anon, n.d.) Yet, a direct archaeological reference to these periods is hard to pinpoint outside of the heavy Etruscanizing elements in some of the civic buildings. (Anon, n.d.) Many believe that the Italicstyle of the Temple of Apollo and the recovery of bucchero pottery associated with the sanctuary suggest a strong Etruscan component to the city. As a result, some have defined earliest Pompeii as a coastal emporium to the inland cities of Nola and Nocera, resembling similar Etruscan settlements such as Gravisca and Pyrgi. (Anon, n.d.) Similarly, the position of Pompeii on an extensive plateau near the sea resembles the location of Etruscan cities such as Veii and Cerveteri and has led scholars to identify an Etruscan foundation of the city. (Anon, n.d.) Nevertheless, the nearby Greek settlements of Neapolis, Cuma, and Paestum must have presented a distinct Greek cultural influence. This factor -on the most basic level-is evident in the Doric elements of the temple in the Triangular Forum at (Anon, n.d.) Similarly, scholars have used the nature of the defenses and the character of the temples to ascribe a typical Greek or Etruscan aspect to the city. Maiuri, a particularly (Anon, n.d.) Strabo Geography V, 4,8. (Anon, n.d.) For a summary of some of the pressing problems concerning the composition of the population of early Pompeii see E. Lepore, Origini e strutture della Campania antica. Saggi di storia etno-sociale (Anon, n.d.)

Chiaramonte Treré, \"The Walls and Gates,\" 146. (Anon, n.d.) See De Waele for a summary of the arguments. De Waele ascribes a heavy Etrusco-Italic design for the temple but does not preclude a distinctly local impetus for its construction. J.A.K.E. de Waele, Il Tempio Dorico del Foro Triangolare di Pompei (Rome, 2001), 127-132. staunch defender of a Hellenic model, ascribes the orthostate wall and its construction technique to a distinct Greek influence. The later Samnite agger system instead reflects an Italic defense tradition. (Anon, n.d.) Such an approach is rather simplistic, as the mechanisms of transmission related to military architecture are difficult to pinpoint. In fact, research suggests a distinct Syracusan, and hence Greek, influence in the agger design of the Servian Walls built in Rome in the fourth century BCE-we will return to these issues below. (Anon, n.d.) Certainly the new construction technique and materials of the orthostate wall contrast dramatically with its pappamonte predecessor. Yet, if this means that we are dealing with an entirely new influence on the city or just an adoption of differing military tactics remains hard to tell. Certainly, a region like ancient Campania with Etruscan, Greek, and Oscan influences remains difficult to characterize. As Thiermann points out, however, Pompeii probably adopted a very own identity as a mixture of those two cultures, or perhaps, even more so, with the addition of the Samnite element playing a distinctive role in the area.foot_54 Perhaps the nature of Campanian society can help explain the character of the two early enceintes, since political and social developments influenced settlement organization and systems of defense. (Anon, n.d.) Aristotle mentions that a single citadel was characteristic of tyrannical or monarchical and oligarchic models of government where the fortified area enabled the control of the population. A city located in a plain was characteristic to a democracy offering much more freedom for commerce and mobility for its citizens. A ruling aristocracy would have a number of strongholds dotting the landscape where each aristocrat or group of families controlled their dependents through private fortified enclosures. (Anon, n.d.) Recent analyses of defensive networks and strategies reach similar conclusions where socio-political motivations and tensions were clear factors in the manner of defense. For example, fortifications built in late Bronze Age Greece were mainly concerned with the private interests of select elites. Villages, presumably occupied by clients, surrounded fortified centers protecting the population from outside threats and the elite from social upheavals. This setup differs from fortifications built in early Greek colonial foundations where they protected the entire community as a reflection of the evening out of social classes. (Anon, n.d.) Changing politics and the appearance of new social ladders led to similar developments on the Greek mainland. The rise of the Athenian democracy shifted defensive concerns from a territorial network of strongholds reflecting the land possessions of the hoplite class, to the construction of the long walls protecting a more egalitarian society resulting from the new defensive emphasis on its navy. (Anon, n.d.) The acropolis therefore quickly lost its importance and was in some cases dispensed with altogether. (Anon, n.d.) At Pompeii the fortifications seem to reflect an oligarchic model of government. By the sixth century BCE the Sarno Valley experienced the culmination of an (Anon, n.d.) Aristotle Politics 7,1330A.35ff. (Anon, n.d.) Winter, Greek Fortifications, 33 and 57 'The history of the sixth century affords many instances of tyrants seizing the citadel as the first step toward control of the city' and further down the page 'The success of a coup d'état could best be assured by occupying the acropolis as a preliminary move.' 211 What Cherici refers to as a transition from a hoplite democracy to a nautical democracy based on the rise of a tradesmen and artisans.

(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) urbanization process spearheaded by aristocratic families organized in individual gentilicial clans. The system rejected private ostentatious display, and the elite instead built monuments and offered votive displays in sanctuaries to express their wealth. (Anon, n.d.) In this framework it is hardly surprising that Pompeii saw the construction of fortifications and sanctuaries dominating the landscape, since they clearly legitimized elite rule and control of the territory. A similar trend occurred in southern Etruria where large settlements occupied high expansive plateaus defended by high natural cliffs and rivers flanking at least two sides. (Anon, n.d.) The religious identity of a community often rested on its identification with sacred spaces such as temples, shrines, altars, and localities. Their defense was therefore of paramount importance. The growing importance of such centralized sacred sites and the need to defend them contributed directly to the emergence of the polis and consequently stimulated the cultural identity of a settlement. The concept of a deity or deities presiding over the well-being of a community, such as Athena was to Athens, and Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva were to Rome, was a reciprocal process that required a communal effort to defend the tutelary gods. (Anon, n.d.) Recent theories have proposed interesting suggestions concerning the relationship between religion, politics, and the consequent location of sanctuaries within settlements. In Greece religious cults were a crucial factor to the formation of a communal identity in early city states. They often found a place in the center of the city, creating a sense of partnership in the cultic beliefs and ceremonies related to the differing groups that formed the early state. By contrast, in Etruria cults initially found a place in the (Anon, n.d.) Cerchiai, I campani, 99-100. (Anon, n.d.) Cristofani \"Economia e società,\" 88. (Anon, n.d.) Gat, \"Why City States Existed? Riddles and Clues of Urbanisation and Fortifications,\" 130. peripheral arx. Etruscan society placed much more emphasis on the celebration of power through rituals of tribal origin and associated gentilicial cults. (Anon, n.d.) Ceremonies were therefore linked to the celebration of the individual gens and probably reflected the feudal nature of Etruscan society. (Anon, n.d.) The investiture of power, or imperium, relied on the correct interpretation of divine will and the promotion of genealogies in the context of myths and local legends. (Anon, n.d.) Consequently, the ritual of the augurium, or bird watching, and the derived prognostic auspicia placed much significance on the hill tops where it occurred. The legitimization of power through such ceremonies entailed that a direct relationship developed between religion, the elite, and the consequent peripheral location of the arx. (Anon, n.d.) Although the mechanisms are difficult to quantify, similar forces likely governed the location of the sanctuaries at Pompeii. The location of the Temple of Apollo near the political heart and Forum of the city is hardly accidental. Similarly, the two temples on the southern tip of the lava ridge clearly relate to the creation of a community and the legitimization of power over the landscape. Their relationship with the city walls supporting them carried further political and religious significance beyond the direct resemblance of the materials employed to construct them. The religious aspect of the city walls at Pompeii is very much attested for later periods and will be discussed in detail below. The very consistency of the courses followed by subsequent enceintes throughout its history suggests that the boundary itself (Anon, n.d.) Menichetti, M. \"The Rituals of Archaic Power.\" In The Etruscans (London 2000), 588. 'In this sense the rituals of archaic power act in contexts which seem to lie halfway between the public and the private: the initiative starts from regal and princely figures, who were originally the leaders of kin groups, but who were later to extend their influence to wider social structures…' 217 M. Torelli, \"The Etruscan City-State.\" In A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures; An Investigation Conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre (Anon, n.d.) M. Menichetti, \"Political Forms in the Archaic Period.\" In The Etruscans (London 2000), 206-207. (Anon, n.d.) Torelli, \"The Etruscan City-State, \" 198. was of critical importance to the city, not only from a defensive point of view. The notion of a religious boundary around a city is particularly strong in the Etruscan tradition and was associated with the foundation rites of cities. In the ritual known as the sulcus primigenius an augur traced the future boundary of the city using a plow pulled by an ox and a bull. The priest would lift the plow at the location of the future gates of the city, thereby allowing for earthly things to pass through the boundary. (Anon, n.d.) The Romans also adopted this ritual: the story of the foundation of Rome includes Romulus tracing the boundary of the city on the Palatine. Remus allegedly crossed the boundary illegally prompting Romulus to murder his brother because of the sacrilege he committed against the gods. 221 The resulting boundary, also known as the pomerium, marked the line within which no one could enter armed, and forbade burials and the gathering of assemblies such as the comitia centuriata. The pomerium itself is a rather vague notion with ancient and modern scholars alike arguing over its true meaning, extent, and course. (Anon, n.d.) Recently Briquel re-examined the sulcus primigenius and defined it as marking the extent of divine protection on the city as well its limits. The associated ritual also expelled otherwise uncontrollable forces of nature. He downplays the religious role of city walls within this context, arguing instead that the walls merely protected rather than occupied the established pomerial boundary. 223 220 Cato in Serv. ad Virg. V Aen 755; Ovid Fasti IV, 819; Fest. 236 221 Plutarch Life of Romulus 10.1; J. Rykwert, The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World (Cambridge, 1988), 29, 135-137. (Anon, n.d.) For a discussion on the ancient sources concerning the foundation ritual see G. Camporeale, \"La città murata d'Etruria nella tradizione letteraria e figurativa.\" In La città murata in Etruria (Pisa, 2008), 17-20. For a recent discussion on the pomerium of Pompeii see L. Jacobelli, \"Pompei fuori le mura. Note sulla gestione e l'organizzazione dello spazio pubblico e privato.\" In Pompei tra Sorrento e Sarno.

Briquel, \"La città murata: Aspetti religiosi.\" In La città murata in Etruria (Pisa, 2008), 121-134. Given the uncertainty of our knowledge it is unclear whether such a ritual accompanied the foundation of early Pompeii, or if the pappamonte enceinte actually followed its hypothetical course. It is entirely possible that the line of the Altstadt actually formed the original pomerium of the city, especially if we consider the area as a separate sacred fortified Etruscan style arx. (Anon, n.d.) Nevertheless, the presence of a religious element is highly likely and probably related to the fortified line acting as a boundary marker between the urban space and the countryside. We know very little of the actual layout of the countryside for this phase of Pompeii except for the presence of the main arteries in and out of the city. (Anon, n.d.) Yet, both enceintes probably formed an important liminal boundary which included religious and cultural notions of self-determination, identification, and political dominance important to those who financed the buildings. The enclosure also protected sacred sanctuaries which, in turn, also symbolically protected the walls and those inside. The southern approach to the city in particular seems to marry the presence of the pappamonte wall with two of the most important sanctuaries present inside the city. More importantly, both sanctuaries dominated the landscape, thereby serving as physical and religious reference points to the regional community (fig. 19). Visually the great strength of the walls and the sanctuaries of the gods complemented each other, creating a unified appearance that stressed the strength of the city and its relationship to the territory. These aspects are all the more compelling if we consider the possible foundation of Pompeii as a sanctuary. Inevitably this message further legitimized the power of those financing the construction of both the sanctuaries and the fortifications as an extension of their own benevolence on the community and their relationship to the gods. The very nature of the pappamonte wall suggests that it carried intrinsic symbolic connotations as a territorial marker in addition to its singular function as a defensive structure. Although it did not represent the most sophisticated fortification system, its route hugged dramatic topographical features, creating a notion of strength and impenetrability. This symbolism extended to a viewer's recognition of the means and resources needed to project such a territorial claim and to construct the wall itself. It is unclear whether the city could muster these resources on its own and perhaps the fortification effort included help from neighboring settlements such as Nocera. (Anon, n.d.) In any event, although the make-up of the city's population remains difficult to pinpoint, the early settlement probably did not have enough of manpower to defend the entire circuit. As a place of refuge, however, the resulting population increase in times of danger likely partially filled that gap. The large enclosure probably also allowed for a measure of self-sufficiency. It countered the threat of sieges or raids through the territory since the area could probably also accommodate limited farming, and protect livestock, movable goods, and produce from the surrounding farms. As a result, the settlement also functioned as an important psychological reference point offering continuous security to the regional population. The walls also allowed a measure of dominance over the population and territory by commanding the land routes through the area and forming a gateway to the Sarno River Valley from the coast. The very use of a local material in the construction of the pappamonte fortification served as a constant visual reminder connecting the settlement (Anon, n.d.) As we shall see, many scholars view Nocera as the head of a loose federation of cities known as the Nucerian league. Its strength and influence is variously debated and most recently down-played. and its territory. It is hard to project a unified architectural image of the city with both its walls due to the chronic lack of knowledge for the period. Yet, the very similarity of the materials employed for the pappamonte wall, the temples, and the houses suggests a measure of overall aesthetic unity. The unified street layout postulated by Coarelli, probably arranged along some form of geometric land parcellation, established a sense of order to those living within the enclosure. The early walls straddled the main arteries with gates that anchored substantial aspects of Pompeii's urban armature for the remainder of its lifetime. Such a level of consistency, whether intended or not, provided an indispensable measure of familiarity and security to the population of the city. Together all these factors helped shape the community and create the settlement. Finally, the construction of the orthostate wall symbolized both a distinct break and a measure of continuity for the settlement. The adoption of new construction techniques and materials along an almost identical course signals a dichotomy of renewal and preservation especially for those experiencing the transitional period between the two structures. The adoption of Sarno limestone, however, also a plentiful regional resource, points to strong local elements at work in the new design. Whether construction of the wall is the result of a political transformation or a deliberate shift in military tactics or both is unclear, but the implications are the same. No other single act could further affirm the dominance on the immediate territory more than the construction of a new wall. The Samnite period is one of the most complex in the urban history of Pompeii. It started in course of the fifth century BCE when Samnite tribes descended from the Apennine Mountains and conquered the city. Scholars traditionally divide the following age into the early Samnite period, spanning the fifth to the third century BCE, and Samnite Pompeii, lasting from the early second century up to the establishment of the Roman colony in 80 BCE. Much of what occurred early in the period will serve as the foundation of the future city and requires special attention in our discussion. A new vigorous era of development began for Pompeii in the late fourth century BCE, when the city expanded back out into the plateau from the Altstadt. Also dubbed as the Neustadt, the start of the urban expansion coincided with the construction of the third defensive enclosure. (Anon, n.d.) Its course and structure formed the basis of the future defensive system and much of the layout of the city for centuries to come. The remains of the limestone enceinte are still impressive. The outer wall face rises over a series of limestone blocks, 40-50 cm high and 60-80 cm wide, stacked in a header and stretcher system. It features a consistent foundation of limestone blocks reaching a depth of six courses throughout the circuit. (Anon, n.d.) Internal piers periodically reinforce the façade which leans at a slight angle to hold back a large earthen mound behind it typical of the Italic agger defensive formation (fig. 5). The general appearance of the parapet is unknown due, in large part, to the reconstruction and elevation of the wall in subsequent refurbishments. As Sakai points out, it is entirely possible that perishable materials, such as mudbrick, composed the top of the wall and the tufa blocks of the later refurbishment completely replaced it. (Anon, n.d.) The best-preserved sections of the outer façade still exist along the southern perimeter of the city between Towers II and IV, and a small tract, roughly twenty-two meters long and seven high, just west of Tower XI (fig. 20). This last section is the most regular, presenting a well-finished section of limestone curtain that gives us a glimpse of its original appearance. (Anon, n.d.) A few further sections still function as terraces on the western side of the city and offer a few clues on the original make-up of the wall. A small tract of curtain survives beneath the House of M. Fabius Rufus (VII.16.21). The top features regularly spaced indentations that once accommodated terracotta spouts. They drained water from a hanging garden and may have replaced earlier versions in the wall curtain. (Anon, n.d.) Further south the House of Umbricus Scaurus (VII.16,15-16) preserves a section up to ten courses high that features the only surviving original drainage spout (fig. 21). Although the evidence is meager, its presence suggests that the wall-walk was unroofed and the spouts drained rainwater from the curtain. The overall height of the structure is debatable, but it probably did not exceed the nine meters estimated for the agger behind. (Anon, n.d.) A small terracing wall contained the earth mound on the city side and an internal pomerial street hugged the circuit to facilitate communications. (Anon, n.d.)

(Anon, n.d.) Krischen, Die Stadtmauern von Pompeji, 11 bases his calculations on the projected stairs at the Porta Stabia where 12-13 steps gave the wall an overall height of about 9 meters. The new wall again followed the tactical ridge of the Pompeian plateau and closely shadowed the course of the previous two defensive enclosures. Only in the eastern section, where the previous circuits remain undetected between the Porta Sarno and Tower VIII, did the wall take a wider course to better exploit the ridge line. Past scholars have accepted Maiuri's hypothesis that the new circuit also led to the closure of the gate at the end of the via di Mercurio to strengthen the most exposed section of the defenses. However, both Guzzo and Hori have recently re-assigned this closure to the construction of Tower XI in the late second century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) Construction crews demolished the outer wall of the previous orthostate fortifications to clear the necessary space for the new curtain, whereas parts of its inner façade were buried in the agger. As discussed further below, the resulting orthostates, too thin and unsuitable for the new fortification, likely ended up in the façades and foundations of new houses going up around the city. (Anon, n.d.) The choice of building the agger system represents a direct response to the military developments occurring at the time. (Anon, n.d.) In the second half of the fifth century BCE armies in Greece and southern Italy developed new siege techniques. The weaponry included early versions of rams, mantlets, catapults, and bolt throwers designed to demolish fortifications. New tactics also evolved that included digging tunnels to apply sapping techniques, or building earth mounds and siege towers to climb over the walls. Defensive measures changed and engineers developed larger towers, stronger masonry, and outworks where ditches and palisades kept catapults out of range and allowed sorties to harass the enemy positions. By 350 BCE armies had fully implemented the use of siege machines, leading to ever more elaborate enceintes and outworks especially in towns lying in vulnerable open plains where they were most effective. (Anon, n.d.) These developments required increasingly specialized and organized armies capable of building and supporting the units. In the fourth century BCE authorities, especially in the Hellenistic world, introduced the payroll, leading to professional yearround standing armies capable of mounting longer campaigns, sieges, and permanently occupy enemy territory. (Anon, n.d.) In Italy the Roman army introduced maniples, small flexible units designed to replace the heavy phalanxes that proved ineffective against the mobile Celtic and Sabine formations it had recently faced. Their versatility also enabled targeted direct attacks on cities and strongholds, resulting in the obsolescence of the existing defenses. (Anon, n.d.) In response, many Italian cities built anew or revised their defensive systems, including (Anon, n.d.) The adoption of the agger in particular is the result of applying new defensive tactics as the heavy earth embankment easily absorbed the vibrations of artillery hits and its weight threatened any tunnelling efforts with cave-ins. If a section of wall did collapse, the embankment continued to offer a measure of protection as the attackers still needed to climb it to enter the city. (Anon, n.d.) The most sophisticated enceintes featured outworks and towers, but their extent and number for Pompeii is unclear, since the defenses likely responded to the terrain. As in previous the circuits, the high lava ridge near the Altstadt probably precluded the necessity of extensive outworks because of the natural strength of the topography. On the other hand, the Porta Stabia included a forward defensive ditch because of its position at the lowest point of the city opening onto the Sarno plain. (Anon, n.d.) Excavations in front of Tower IX suggest a similar ditch on the northern side of the city, but the picture for the remainder of the circuit is incomplete. (Anon, n.d.) The presence of numerous towers is similarly a matter of debate. Maiuri uncovered the remains of one buried under the subsequent expansion of the agger on the northwest tip of the Porta Vesuvio. Its presence has led some scholars to hypothesize that the current towers replaced earlier versions. Others prefer to view it as an isolated example related to vulnerable position of the gate. (Anon, n.d.) Only systematic excavations can clarify the issue, but it seems likely that other towers further fortified the circuit. The limestone fortifications of the city clearly responded to pragmatic needs. The choice of material, a relatively cheap and plentiful resource lying in banks along the Sarno River Valley, is similarly a practical rather than aesthetic choice. Unlike the hard limestone used in the polygonal masonry walls characteristic of the Apennine region, Sarno limestone is actually a form of travertine. (Anon, n.d.) It is notoriously difficult to carve beyond basic geometric shapes, but its soft makeup allowed it to be sawed into blocks. This method resulted in the characteristic slightly oblique sides present on most masonry produced by the juxtaposition of the blocks. It quickly strengthened after contact with air and its prolonged exposure to rain led to limestone precipitation that sealed the sutures between blocks and created exceptionally strong masonry. (Anon, n.d.) Limestone is constantly forming in the Pompeii area; lime is richly suspended in the cold springs of the Apennines and naturally precipitates in the warmer waters of the Sarno plain. As a result, quarrying the stone prevented entire areas from transforming into sterile swaps unfit for cultivation. The process also reclaimed land to expand farming activities. (Anon, n.d.) To a certain extent, therefore, the growth of the city and its population went hand in hand with the process of land reclamation. The large-scale use of limestone in buildings, and especially its fortifications, not only carried the added benefit of reclaiming land for cultivation, but undoubtedly expressed a strong symbolic statement of the society's domination over the landscape and its desire to expand the city. Hypothetically this factor may even be symbolic of Pompeii's regional reach and the fortifications may therefore also symbolize the limit of its territory in the landscape. Unfortunately, the precise quarries of the limestone remain unknown beyond the general approximation of the area of lower Sarno River Valley. A full assessment of this particular aspect awaits further investigations. With this wider symbolic consideration in mind, there are hints of aesthetic concerns at play in the fortifications. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the limestone is its bright yellow color. The ashlars composing the wall surface, dressed smoothly despite the natural coarseness of the material, presented a solid and uniform façade to those approaching the city. The lowest three masonry courses display a rough bugnato, or rustication, as a deliberate aesthetic effect. (Anon, n.d.) A similar rustication is also present in Greece in the fourth century BCE fortifications at Eleusis. In fact, Greek fortifications display aesthetic considerations stretching back to the ninth century bce walls of Old Smyrna, where a tower displayed a marked purposeful contrast in masonry techniques. (Anon, n.d.) At Pompeii a decorative socle is most evident in the curtain east of Porta Nocera, south of the Porta Marina, near Tower VII, and the bastions of the Porta Nola and Sarno (fig. 22). (Anon, n.d.) Traces of a similar rustication decorated the internal supporting wall spanning the via di Mercurio on the city side of the fortifications. Partially demolished and buried in the later expansion of the agger, the wall survives in a fragmentary state. Large limestone blocks compose the mainstay of the terrace; they are identical to those on the outer façade, but a small section built in tufa spans the width of the street (fig. 23). (Anon, n.d.) It may represent a repair, or a much later closure of the gate at the end of the street, but the dark brown tufa blocks contrast markedly with the yellow limestone. Their smaller size and rustication served to visually emphasize the limit of the agger at the end of the street and particularly contributed to the overall grandeur of the via di Mercurio where we later find a concentration of elite housing. Another large structure displaying decorative rustication is the tower or bastion on the northwest tip of the Porta Vesuvio. Steps recovered on its southern side during excavations suggest that the building was once freestanding. The tower supplemented the defenses by standing immediately in front of the gate and added to its formidable appearance. (Anon, n.d.) The remains rise over eight lower limestone courses surmounted by six in tufa, creating a dramatic contrast that, as we shall in the next chapter, becomes a defining element of the fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) The tufa blocks on the western side display the remains of a subtle rustication, further highlighting the juxtaposition between the two materials (fig. 24). The north and east sides now lack the rustication, but it was probably removed in the later modifications of the curtain walls. (Anon, n.d.) The resulting decorative effect included a prominent socle and rusticated blocks which to some extent prefigure the white First-Style stucco ensembles later applied to the towers and gates of the circuit. According to Maiuri the materials used in the construction of the tower reflected two phases: the first using limestone built in conjunction with the fortification, and the second using tufa in a refurbishment that occurred soon thereafter in the first half of the third century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) However, this assumption is a common problem for Maiuri's theories; there really is no proof for a refurbishment besides the employment of two different construction materials. In my opinion, this choice of materials is a deliberate aesthetic effect which, as we shall in the following chapter, prefigures similar considerations applied to the upgrade of the circuit carried out in the late third century BCE. In fact, given its position and prominence, embellishing such a building is no accident and architects may have employed the two materials for aesthetic or even tactical considerations unknown to us. As noted previously, this area of the fortifications was particularly vulnerable with the terrain sloping gently up Vesuvius to the north and dropping dramatically south into the town. Construction of the tower was primarily a defensive necessity to further protect the gate. Nevertheless, the area is also the highest in (Anon, n.d.) Only the southern façade differs slightly displaying a few stray limestone blocks in the tufa courses. (Anon, n.d.) As we shall see in the next chapters, a later lararium in the porta Vesuvio perhaps eliminated the rustication to accommodate a fresco. The north side perhaps worked in a wider decorative scheme featuring the play of tufa and limestone elements, but we shall return to these developments later. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 188. the city transforming the tower -and by extension the gate-into a landmark visible for many miles around. These examples point to a deliberate concern with the appearance of the fortifications and how they presented the city. Another section of curtain, however, deserves scrutiny because it suggests a disregard of this notion. The stretch, already mentioned above, survives as a terracing structure for the later house of M. Fabius Rufus. Its dimensions are conspicuous reaching some nine courses or six and a half meters high. The tract has no discernible rustication and displays three vertical masonry seams resulting in misaligned wall course heights (fig. 25). Admittedly the bugnato may still be buried, but the seams either represent later repairs or mark individual giornate, or days of work, as construction crews moved forward. (Anon, n.d.) They may also be the product of different construction crews as their workmanship, competence, and technical expertise could affect the integrity of a masonry style in a circuit. (Anon, n.d.) If anything, the seams are a unique example of the construction process for the city walls of Pompeii. The result, however, contrasts markedly with the regular ashlar masonry elsewhere in the circuit. Perhaps the builders were less concerned with the appearance of the wall here due to its relative isolation from the rest of the city, or the wish to limit expenses, foregoing a careful construction process. Such practices are well-attested in Greece, where towns employed neater masonry in prominent and visible areas as opposed to the cheaper and rougher workmanship of the more isolated tracts. (Anon, n.d.) Some clear examples of these considerations still exist at Oiniadai, Assos, and Crane. Cities used this tactic to flaunt their wealth and (Anon, n.d.) Cassetta and Constantino, \"Vivere sulle mura,\" 198. 256 See Winter, Greek Fortifications, 83. Grimaldi identifies only one seam and thinks it represents the meeting point of gangs of workmen approaching each other at different heights from the north and the south. See M. Grimaldi, \"Charting the Urban Development of the Insula Occidentalis and the Casa di Marcus Fabius Rufus.\" In The Making of Pompeii, edited by S.J.R. Ellis (Portsmouth, 2011), 144. (Anon, n.d.) Lawrence, Greek Aims in Fortification, 235. create more imposing defenses on their approach routes, and such considerations were clearly also at work in Pompeii. With these factors in mind, it is the gates that should carry the most distinct representational elements. As mentioned, the first Samnite wall forms the mainstay of the later fortifications and this period also sees the definitive anchoring of the gates into the city. In some shape or form many gates were already open in the earliest enceintes, but it is with this circuit that they started acquiring their present architectural layout. The only real modification is the eventual closure of the gate at the end of the via di Mercurio due to the vulnerable topography and the proximity of the Porta Ercolano and Vesuvio. (Anon, n.d.) Most scholars recognize the Porta Stabia as the oldest gate because of its primary limestone construction. The other gates adopted a similar layout, and scholars have projected the reconstruction of the Porta Stabia upon the other gates of the city. The current appearance of the gate is the result of later additions, but the basic plan remained unchanged: two forward bastions followed by a long internal passageway through the agger and an internal threshold into the city (fig. 26). The remains have generated a rather intense scholarly discussion concerning its original appearance. Much of the debate centers on whether the exterior bastions supported an arch, if the steps leading to the parapet featured an intermediate landing, the length of the inner passageway, the exact position and number of gates closing the passageway, and whether the opus incertum arch replaced an earlier tufa version. (Anon, n.d.) All of these discussion points relate to the original design of the gate as a Vorhoftor, or forecourt gate, which came in many variants but usually featured some sort of overhead passage linking the external bastions and internal thresholds. From a military perspective the design was intended to trap any attackers in the court of the gate, allowing defenders to pelt enemy troops from above. (Anon, n.d.) Although the current remains do not allow an accurate reconstruction, they do point out how differing construction techniques highlighted a distinct tripartite division of the passageway. The roadway originally sat five meters lower, resulting in a formidable cavernous appearance to the gateway. (Anon, n.d.) The bastions, composed of solid horizontal ashlar masonry, indicated the most powerful exterior line of the fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) Although some like to see a portcullis closing the passage, a two-leafed gate likely marked entry into the court where vertical orthostate blocks signaled the transitional space between the exterior and the interior of the city. If we consider Krischen's reconstruction, the court walls originally followed the slope of the agger allowing for gradient flanking positions against the enemy and accentuating the power of the defenses. (Anon, n.d.) The inner threshold, perhaps marked by another gate or, as is in the later version an early vaulted passageway, announced the transition into the urban space. Each element acted as a clear stage marker for any traffic passing through the gate further distinguished by the differing construction techniques (fig. 27). Maiuri believed that the differing techniques represent specific construction events where the orthostate blocks of the gate court correspond to the first phase followed (Anon, n.d.) See Brands, Republikanische Stadttore in Italien, 8-29. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 191. (Anon, n.d.) For the exact dimensions of the various blocks see Fiorelli Gli scavi di Pompei dal 1861 Al 1872, 80. (Anon, n.d.) Krischen, shows a two leafed gate. Krischen, Die Stadtmauren von Pompeji plate 2 and 3, Others like Overbeck see the grooves originally supporting a portcullis. Overbeck, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken (Leipzig, 1875), 55. by the addition of the two outer bastions. (Anon, n.d.) Recent excavations, however, suggest a single construction event for the gate; they also raise a series of questions on the construction techniques employed. Admittedly, the masonry types relate to differing styles and the court walls use the emplecton technique in a similar fashion to the earlier orthostate wall. This circumstance may simply be the result of their role as a reinforcement to hold back the agger. Yet the choice of using orthostate masonry may also relate to a desire to differentiate and highlight the steps of passage through the agger into the city. Rites of passage between spaces are crucial elements to notions of inclusion and exclusion in communities. (Anon, n.d.) Fortifications in particular expressed a taboo against accessing the other side, and gates represented magico-religious liminal areas in between internal and external spaces. As discussed further in the next chapter, they also represented the social, territorial, and political status quo of the city. Arnold van Gennep in particular describes three distinct stages for territorial passages: the separation or preliminal, the transitional or liminal, and the incorporation or post-liminal. (Anon, n.d.) Whether their design was deliberately aesthetic or a necessity to reinforce a passage through the agger remains uncertain, but the masonry seems clearly manipulated to highlight the three steps of inclusion and exclusion to the community. We find a similar tripartite division in the fauces, or entrances to the houses of Pompeii, composed of a long corridor with distinctive thresholds on either side. Their liminal role led to their protection under four divinities: Janus as the overarching guardian, Ferculus who watched over the door leaves, Limentius who protected the threshold and lintel, and finally Cardea who attended the hinges. (Anon, n.d.) Because of their multivalent liminal roles, city gates and fortifications often received special religious protection or carried apotropaic devices to protect the community. (Anon, n.d.) As discussed further below, eminent examples still exist in the Porta all'Arco in Volterra and the Porta Marzia in Perugia. The Porta Stabia still carries two small niches carved into the eastern wall face of the court for the veneration of a deity protecting the walls and travelers traversing the liminal space. The top niche functioned in the final phase of the gate and excavators recovered it fully coated in stucco and carrying a graffito in the back reading PATRVA-a reference to Minerva Patrua. (Anon, n.d.) The lower niche is associated with two previous phases that included a small altar buried into the later sidewalk (fig. 28). Its first phase belongs to the original construction of the gate at the dawn of the third century BCE. The second dates to the late second century BCE when a fill related to the reorganization of the defenses partially buried the altar. Nevertheless, a new coat of stucco attests that the shrine remained in use. The fill contained the remains of votive offerings, including the upper half of a small terracotta statue broken into three pieces. The published drawing shows a female figure in a frontal pose, but she remains unidentified due to a lack of defining attributes. If we allow for a continuity of cult she likely represents Minerva and, as discussed further in chapter five, her frontal pose is similar to a statue of the goddess recovered at Porta Marina.

The subtle decorative embellishments on the fortifications are the expression of a confident city. To better understand their role in creating a sense of civic unity, we turn again to the urban area they enclosed to see how they resonated in the architectural and social layout. Scholars have variously dated the limestone fortifications, but the most recent consensus sees their construction occurring in the late fourth/early third century (Anon, n.d.) This is also the period when the Sarno Valley becomes a war theater during the Second Samnite War and Roman troops landed near Pompeii to sack the inland territory of Nocera in 310 BCE. (Anon, n.d.) It is unclear whether the limestone circuit already defended the town during this incursion. In any event, the troops headed directly inland completely ignoring Pompeii, either because of its relative unimportance or because it possessed a well-defended enclosure. The subsequent ambush and defeat of the Roman troops at the hands of a peasant uprising, however, indicates a typically Samnite de-centralized territorial occupation, and suggests that the inhabitants temporarily sought refuge in strongholds such as (Anon, n.d.) This picture would soon change after Pompeii, along with Nocera, entered into an alliance with Rome as a civitas foederata at the end of the war. (Guzzo et al., 2005) The picture for fourth century BCE Pompeii is one of a few modest homes situated near the Forum and the Triangular Forum. (Anon, n.d.) Its new alliance resulted in a wave of wealth and commerce as Pompeii extended its contacts with the east, southern Italy, and Rome to the north. (Anon, n.d.) The remains of shops found on the eastern side of the Forum point to the gradual establishment of a merchant social class capable, perhaps, of financing some of the new building projects in the city including the defenses. (Anon, n.d.) The question concerning who or what acted as a catalyst for the construction of the new circuit is difficult to answer primarily because of the chronic lack of knowledge for the social make-up of the city. The few graves related to the Samnite period found outside of the Porta Stabia and Ercolano offer little evidence other than pointing out that the practice of burying the dead outside of the city walls was already current. (Corte, 1916) The sheer scale of the operation, however, suggests the involvement of some outside element, such as neighboring Nuceria or Rome, for military expertise and financial backing especially if we consider the scattered occupation of the hinterland. The new relationship of Pompeii with Rome in particular sparked a re-birth of the city that included extensive social and religious alliances that influenced the remainder of its history. (Anon, n.d.) Besides the fortifications, few public buildings date to the end of the fourth century BCE. Recent work on the House of the Cretan Forms (VII, 4, 62) revealed the remains of a possible public banqueting space, or hestiaterion, indicating the presence of a strong Greek social custom throughout the third century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) The older cults in the city also received renewed attention. The Temple to Apollo regained importance and votive offerings soon resumed. (Anon, n.d.) Around 325 BCE the Doric Temple in the Triangular Forum received a general refurbishment including the addition of a new roof with metopes and acroteria representing Hercules and Athena/Minerva Phrygia. (Anon, n.d.) This cult in particular, as we shall see in chapter five, is a regional political phenomenon that scholars associate with either a renascent league of cities headed by neighboring Nocera, or with the new Roman alliances developed after the Second Samnite War. (Anon, n.d.) The new fortifications are intimately connected with this refurbishment, functioning as a new terrace platform for the temple and reasserting the dual martial and divine protective elements on the city. This development seems especially apt considering Minerva's role as protectress of cities and it will remain a consistent element in the religious character of the fortifications. New dwellings accompanied the expansion of wealth and a certain amount of controversy surrounds the appearance of the houses during the late fourth and the third centuries BCE. Much of it concerns whether limestone featured as the primary construction material. Giuseppe Fiorelli first defined the architectural history of the city associating it broadly to the main historical developments occurring on the Italian peninsula. He described three distinct periods loosely connected to the use of building materials; limestone, tufa, and concrete and brick. Mau later refined these periods to five: the limestone period which includes the so-called houses with limestone atria, the tufa period, the early Roman colony, the Imperial period, and finally the post 62 CE earthquake reconstructions. (Anon, n.d.) The framework still forms the basic premise for the architectural history of Pompeii, although recent scholarship rightly blurs the lines between the phases by pointing out that materials and techniques can cross over into later periods. It is not the purpose of this dissertation to dive into the complexity of the debate concerning the accuracy of these time distinctions and the questions raised by subsequent excavations. As Jean Pierre Adam points out, the question of a true limestone phase for the city remains debatable due to the paucity of remains, differing quarrying rate of the materials employed, and the continued use of limestone materials into later periods. (Anon, n.d.) Nevertheless, the earliest houses at Pompeii feature some clear similarities in their design and construction technique. The House of the Scientists (VI.14.43) and the House of Amarantus (I.9.11-12) form the earliest attested examples with their first phase dating (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) Pompei: Its Life and Art 37-44. 285 J.P. Adam, \"Building Materials, Construction Techniques and Chronologies.\" In The World of Pompeii, edited by P. Foss and J.J. Dobbins (New York, 200), 99. Richardson Pompeii: An Architectural History, 370 dismisses a limestone period as entirely fictitious. A heavy debate also exists in print between Pesando and Amoroso. See Pesando \"Case di età medio-sannitica nella Regio VI\" and A. Amoroso, L'Insula VII, 10 di Pompei. Analisi stratigrafica e proposte di ricostruzione (Rome, 2007). to the late fourth century BCE (fig. 29). (Anon, n.d.) A detailed metrological analysis has shown that the House of the Scientists, the House of the Surgeon (VI.1.10), and the House of the Naviglio (VI.10.11) display similar layouts and designs derived from a common origin. (Anon, n.d.) Recent excavations in Regio VI also confirm that the House of the Centaur (VI.9.5), the House of the Naviglio, and Houses VI.9.1 and VI.14.39 chronologically span the third century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) These dwellings articulate around wide open Tuscan atria and contrast markedly with the more modest called case a schiera, or row houses, found in I.11 suggesting that they belonged to the wealthy class of (Anon, n.d.) Most houses employed a similar construction technique using limestone opus quadratum for their façades, and opus africanum, a loose mortar and rubble technique laced with large limestone blocks, for internal walls. The façades are actually rather somber and uniform solids, pierced occasionally with small window slits allowing light into the house. (Anon, n.d.) The evidence from Regio VI suggests that First-Style decorative programs embellished the 286 A. Wallace-Hadrill, \"Excavation and Standing Structures in Pompei Insula I.9.\" In Nuove ricerche archeologiche a Pompei ed Ercolano. Atti del convegno internazionale, edited by P.G. Guzzo and M.P. Guidobaldi (Napoli, 2005), 101-108 poses some questions on the accuracy for the chronology of this phase in the House of Amarantus as some opus quadratum walls seem to sit in earlier levels.

They also identify houses VI,14,39 and VI,14,40 as having almost identical facades. interiors of the houses, but no indications exist for their exterior. (Anon, n.d.) Prior to the eruption wide swaths of First-Style stucco coated the limestone façades on the via di Mercurio, but they probably functioned to disguise repairs conducted after the earthquake of 62 CE, or they were part of a new image to the city developed in the Roman period. As highlighted in the next chapter, house owners in the following tufa period often opted to leave the masonry naked for the intrinsic statement of the stone. If the limestone façades featured no further embellishment then their construction technique and material clearly created a dialogue with the city walls. Together the house façades and the walls created a distinct unified image. As mentioned above, Amedeo Maiuri suggested that blocks used in some of the limestone façades are actually spolia of the external orthostate wall demolished to make way for the new agger. (Anon, n.d.) Eschebach elaborated this notion further and emphatically stated that the earliest limestone façades are actually all composed of re-used blocks from the orthostate wall. (Anon, n.d.) Recent investigations in Regio VI uncovered further evidence for the use of spoliation blocks in house foundations and façades. (Anon, n.d.) Yet, as attractive as assigning these blocks to the orthostate wall may be, this theory rests on similarities in measurement that could potentially represent uniform quarrying standards. Nevertheless, many of the blocks are likely spolia. Their reuse is probably primarily a matter of expediency, but they may also carry a more symbolic significance. The very survival of these façades up to the eruption, even after the interiors saw radical alterations, poses some important questions. As elite houses, their façades likely carried a more important representational element related to the status of the owner. Furthermore, many limestone houses sit above pre-Samnite examples and such a continuity of place might relate either to their prime location or the incorporation of a select elite into the Samnite town. (Anon, n.d.) Although difficult to quantify, the re-use of the blocks may therefore also represent a measure of antiquarianism, nostalgia, ancestral continuity, or conquest and renewal of the city. The first three notions are difficult to gauge and they depend on whether parts of the orthostate wall were visible, and their possible interpretation as a relic. Although the excavations at Tower IX suggest that parts of the inner façade remained visible for an extended period of time, these factors remain almost impossible to ascertain without further evidence. (Anon, n.d.) However, the notions of conquest and/or renewal likely accompanied the initial construction process of the new wall. These are messages are more implicit and immediately tangible in the execution of such a large construction project. The expansion of building activity at Pompeii included the basic arrangement of its street network. The layout has generated much discussion and is important since it acts as the armature for the city's future development. The city walls and the gates essentially anchored the main access routes in and out of Pompeii. Other entry points, in the form of posterns or towers, probably aligned along minor north-south and east-west roads dividing up the plan. (Anon, n.d.) Although no direct evidence exists for a re-foundation of the city, the coherent layout is the product of a single plan. It led early scholars to equate it with the first foundation of the city, and any possible associated rites. (Nissen et al., 1913) The design rests with the equidistant via Stabiana and via di Nola each forming the main north-south cardo and east-west decumanus of the city (fig. 30). The via dell'Abbondanza acts as a second decumanus and the two divide the via Stabiana into three equal sections. The third section also returns in the length of the via di Mercurio and the distance between the Porta Sarno and Nola, whereas the gap between via di Nocera and the via Stabiana is exactly half the length of the cardo. (Anon, n.d.) The city subsequently expanded in a tiered development in precisely parceled plots set out along the main axes. Regio VI developed first followed by the line of insulae along the east side of the via Stabiana. The intervening space with the outer Altstadt filled up soon afterwards and the development later continued into the eastern portion of the city. (Geertman & Geertman, 2001) As in the Archaic period, the enclosed area never achieved full urbanization. Regio I and II in particular remained thinly occupied with agricultural buildings up to the eruption of Vesuvius. (Nappo & Jashemski, 1979) A similar but more extensive picture for farmland within the enceinte exists for the early Samnite period. Post-holes related to agricultural work uncovered beneath Insula I in Regio VI and excavations near the Porta Stabia suggest a lack of urbanization between the fourth and mid-second centuries BCE. (For et al., 2002) The arrangement of the walls and the main street network are clearly interrelated, suggesting a desire to monumentalize the city. (Anon, n.d.) Such an orchestrated design raises the question whether there is any further meaning to the layout and, by extension, the course of the walls. A pragmatic approach identifies a primarily militaristic scheme where the walls and street network interacted to offer the greatest defensive capabilities and the minor roads facilitated communications toward the individual sections of the enceinte. (Anon, n.d.) Beyond this secular martial explanation there is no shortage of more abstract theories. Without digressing too far into the intricacies of the general debate concerning archaeoastronomy and urban foundations, the discussion for Pompeii centers on the orientation of the streets and its developmental history. The problem in essence revolves around identifying a predominantly Greek, Etruscan, Samnite, or Roman character of the city. Orthogonal planning was a secular endeavor for the Greeks where roads were predominantly oriented according to topographic or hygienic considerations requiring that a city opened to the winds for a healthy environment. (Anon, n.d.) This approach, however, already found its critics in antiquity: Roman architect Vitruvius believed that winds were actually detrimental to good health. (Anon, n.d.) These ideals, however, were theoretical and not always practiced. Much more debate surrounds Etruscan orthogonal plans; many scholars describe the symbolic designation of the celestial templum onto the city. In essence, two axes divided the great heavenly sphere into four distinct quadrants that found their earthly correlation in the notion of the circular city, its central mundus, and the cardo and the decumanus inscribing the urbs quadrata. (Anon, n.d.) This idea, however, has received heavy criticism since it relates primarily to the orientation of temples rather than cities. (Anon, n.d.) Finally the Roman agrimensores, or land surveyors, borrowed heavily from Etruscan ideals but transformed them into more secular notions. They often used the solstices to align the centuriation of the countryside, perhaps also as a time keeping device, but symbolic patterns in town plans are less evident. (Gall, 1975) The arguments for Pompeii are quite long and complicated, and relate primarily to the history of theories concerning the city's development, i.e., the grand design envisioned by early scholarship versus the Altstadt/Neustadt theory and its later adaptations. Castagnoli summarizes the debate up to 1971 and the arguments, with the exception of a brief summary, need no repetition to the same level of detail here. Early scholarship recognized the via di Nola as the cardo and the via Stabiana as the decumanus of the city. Their intersection was the central square, or the mundus, and the original starting point for the layout of the city. Leading proponents of a grand Pompeii argued for the pomerium of the city following the present line of the Samnite walls. (Anon, n.d.) With the introduction of the Altstadt theory scholarship identified the via di Mercurio/via del Foro/via delle Scuole as the cardo, whereas the via Marina/via dell'Abbondanza acted as the decumanus. At their intersection the Forum formed the new origin point for the layout of Pompeii and, as a recent hypothesis suggests, an Etruscan foundation of the Altstadt. (Anon, n.d.) As a result, the pomerium probably followed the line of the Altstadt fortifications, whereas the later Neustadt instead followed a Greek design with multiple cardines and decumani primarily secular in nature. (Anon, n.d.) Hans Eschebach, applying Le Gall's model derived from the principles of the Roman agrimensores, suggested a somewhat more symbolic layout. He points out that both the via dell'Abbondanza and the via di Nola align with the summer solstice, whereas the via Stabiana closely lines up with the winter solstice. (Anon, n.d.) De Caro takes the notion further identifying the via di Nola as creating a deliberate axis with Monte Torrenone to the east where the federal sanctuary of Foce Sarno marks a source of the Sarno River (fig. 30). (Caro, n.d.) The same orientation is also present in the street network of neighboring Nocera, where a similar urban transformation occurred in the early third century BCE, including the construction of an agger defensive system. The alignments symbolize a wider political union and re-birth after their insertion into the Roman sphere of influence. (Anon, n.d.) Felice Senatore poses some serious doubts to these assertions pointing out that these aligned axes actually miss the source of the river and the sanctuary probably did not exist yet. (Senatore, 2001) Despite such reservations, Guzzo recently used the theory to place the entire territory outside of the city and its division under the divine protection of the federal sanctuary. (Anon, n.d.) By inserting the landscape into the equation its layout, i.e., the parcellation of the land and the roads running through it, adds more importance to the role of the fortifications since their placement also anchored the division of the countryside. As a result, they acted as a distinguishing and yet unifying element for the city and its territory, essentially acting as a filter point for movements in and out of Pompeii. The expansion of the city required a higher rate of agricultural production leading to an early centuriation of the landscape. Although much of the Pompeian chora remains buried and therefore difficult to characterize, a well-organized landscape supporting the city is highly likely. Scholars project the land parcellation of Regio VI continuing, by osmosis, on axis with the via Mercurio beyond the walls by the second half of the fourth century BCE. They hypothesize a similar centuriation laid out along the via di Nocera toward the Sarno River. (Anon, n.d.) Presumably, this organized landscape existed along the main routes outside of the other gates, but its extent is unknown. Whether the orientation of Pompeii's streets carried deliberate symbolic associations or was coincidental due to the topographical layout of the plateau remains hard to ascertain. (Anon, n.d.) In fact, projecting Etruscan and Roman foundational rites on Pompeii may seem somewhat premature in light of the tenuous evidence and the rich diversity of the region. The most recent theory on the layout of the city departs radically from traditional views. Francesco Vitale assigns precise astronomical connotations to the layout of Pompeii, correlating the course of the walls to a perfect ellipse. Inside temples and gates align along precise linear patterns to create a protective religious umbrella resembling a pentagram over the city (fig. 31). He notes that this layout follows precise astronomical 318 F. Zevi, \"Urbanistica di Pompei.\" In La regione sotterrata dal Vesuvio. Studi e prospettive. Atti del convegno internazionale, 11-15 novembre 1979, 3 (Naples, 1979) 357. S. C. Nappo, \"Urban Transformation at Pompeii in the Late 3rd and Early 2nd c. B.C.\" In Domestic Space in the Roman World : Pompeii and Beyond, edited by Ray Laurence and Andrew Wallace-Hadrill (Portsmouth, 1997), 94-96. 319 Richardson, Pompeii: An Architectural History, 41 argues for a primary topographical element. calculations reflected in the street alignment with the solstices that formed a memory capsule of Pompeii's foundation for future generations. The layout is therefore primarily the result of the city's original foundation as a sanctuary evidenced by the plateau's relative isolation from readily available water sources. Its burgeoning sacred groves subsequently grew to such an economic importance that they necessitated the construction of fortifications to keep out thieves and brigands. (Anon, n.d.) The approach is interesting and Pompeii may indeed have been founded as a sanctuary. Some of the conclusions however are, in my opinion, a little far-reaching. (Anon, n.d.) Although the exact meaning of Pompeii's layout, if any, remains difficult to quantify, it seems likely that military concerns and topographical elements primarily dictated the urban framework. (Anon, n.d.) The picture for Pompeii is one where the city lays the groundwork for its future appearance. This is a massive operation that included laying out streets, regularizing the countryside, and constructing the walls. With the gates opening onto regional roads, these elements will remain virtually unchanged for the remainder of the city's history, creating a clear factor of continuity for its population. (Anon, n.d.) The streets also created visual axes focusing either on the agger or towers resulting in the fortifications creating a constant visual presence throughout the city and continuously projecting a sense of security on its population. As discussed further in the next chapter, 320 F. Vitale, Astronomia ed esoterismo nell'antica Pompei e ricerche archeoastronomiche a Paestum, Cuma, Velia, Metaponto, Crotone, Locri e Vibo Valentia, in particular see p. 59, 89- (Anon, n.d.) This is primarily because the arguments rest on a set of coincidences and arbitrary connections drawn from lines on a map. Lines, in essence, that can be drawn and interpreted arbitrarily, creating endless connections and interpretations. (Anon, n.d.) For a recent assessment on the heavy influence of topography on the layout of Pompeii see M. Holappa and E.M. Viitanen, \"Topographic Conditions in the Urban Plan of Pompeii: The Urban Landscape.\" In The Making of Pompeii, edited by S.J.R. (Anon, n.d.) Only the Porta Marina, perhaps, lay slightly further a-back at the tip of the hill. The evidence for this is scant but some scholars believe that the remains of a few blocks on the eastern end of the precinct of the temple of Venus are the remains of an earlier version of the porta marina. See P. Arthurs, \"Problems of the Urbanization of Pompeii. Excavations 1980-1981.\" The Antiquaries Journal 66 (1986): 29-44. the towers in particular, if they indeed existed in this period, also projected a measure of internal security acting as small fortresses capable of controlling the population. In essence it means that, to some extent, notions of security permeated the rest of the city's history, consciously or unconsciously affecting those living inside the protection of its walls. Initially at least the use of earth and the Sarno limestone projected a strong association amongst the town, the fortifications, and its hinterland. This seems particularly the case if the massive use of limestone resulted in extensive land reclamation supporting the expanding city. The spectacle of constructing the walls, including quarrying and transporting the stone blocks, and the hundreds of carts needed to transport the agger earth must have been quite impressive. Pesando identifies Regio VI as one of the sources for the earth, suggesting a local and perhaps even immediate retrieval of the fill in proximity of the fortification throughout the city. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri suggests, due to the completely sterile nature of the earth, distant unspecified locations for its retrieval, but either scenario further strengthens the bond between city and territory. (Anon, n.d.) A further connection between the city and its walls occurred through Pompeii's architecture. The limestone façades of elite houses and the ashlar masonry of the walls connected on multiple levels where a local material, used in a local context, fostered a local identity. These factors are most evident in the subtle decorative additions on the curtain wall and gates of Pompeii. The city walls encompassed a wide open area interspersed with housing aligned along an orthogonal plan with a slightly more densely occupied Altstadt. In simple terms this configuration created a dichotomy between the Altstadt and the Neustadt, or old and new, reflected primarily in the fortifications, and it also established the space for Pompeii's future expansion. The walls also responded to the latest developments in warfare and encompassed a wide area to accommodate the population of the chora; they established a measure of self-sufficiency with extensive protected farmland within the enclosure. The walls also worked on a wider territorial scale. The parcellation of the city and parts of the countryside created a distinct imposition and artificial organization on the landscape. The walls in essence acted as a crown highlighting the new organization, simultaneously unifying and distinguishing the city and countryside through dominance and imposition. It is no surprise, therefore, that as in the previous periods a strong connection also exists between the fortifications and its sanctuaries as visual landmarks on the city and the hinterland. Both structures functioned to legitimize the power of those who financed the projects, their status in the city, and their relationship with its protective deities. In many ways the city and its chora form one unit and its image, as Zanker describes for the late Republican period, will be cultivated by both the community and the individual. 326 At Pompeii the groundwork for this trend starts in the late fourth century BCE and will continue to gather pace and diversify in the centuries to come. All these factors symbolically translated into the new defensive bastion. The use of decorative elements in the walls confirms the presence of a communal identity. This principle translated into the concept, or idea, of the city as is reflected in the extensive unity of its urban, territorial, and architectural layout. Although the reasons for the dramatic expansion of Pompeii remain enigmatic, strong political and social forces shaped its appearance. Its image and, by extension, the fortifications enclosing it are a reflection of the society that built Pompeii and their concept of the ideal city. The previous chapters have focused primarily on the architectural relationship between the appearance of the city and its walls, and to a certain extent the anthropological aspects of fortifications affecting the population. This approach was necessary because of the paucity of any other evidence for early Pompeii. Our picture becomes clearer for the second century BCE since much more evidence, including inscriptions and more copious physical remains, allows for a more in-depth analysis on the performance of the fortifications. However, many of the aspects discussed up to this point will continue to form a backdrop in what follows. An important element to remember in this chapter is that the momentous urban and social development of Pompeii continued under both Roman and Hellenistic influences that remain difficult to quantify. Both 'Hellenization' and 'Romanization' are terms that are the object of a heavy scholarly debate that I will not engage with here. Nevertheless, the Pompeian alliance with Rome strongly influenced the city; whereas the increased exposure of both cities to the Hellenistic world, and the strong Greek character of the early Bay of Naples, blurs the assignation of a single distinct cultural influence upon Samnite (Anon, n.d.) After the establishment of the limestone fortifications the defenses undergo a radical transformation. The intervention on the walls is rather difficult to date precisely, but scholars generally view it as a response to the Second Punic War. The scenarios are multiple with the upgrade occurring in conjunction with gathering war clouds, during the conflict itself, or as a general need to reinforce weak fortifications after the hostilities. (Anon, n.d.) Scholars, therefore, generally agree that the intervention occurred at the end of the third century BCE. The defenses received a substantial reinforcement featuring a new internal wall, a higher outer curtain, and an expansion of the agger. The material adopted for this intervention is tufa, a dark grey/brown volcanic stone found primarily in the Lattari Mountains near the neighboring city of Nocera. The resulting visual contrast with the previous limestone masonry seems deliberate, reflecting the social and architectural developments of the city (fig. 32). The area between the Porta Ercolano and Vesuvio highlights the main elements and reasons behind this massive reinforcement (fig. 5). The most marked of these is the presence of the internal wall performing both structural and defensive roles. Rising higher than the external curtain, the wall created a second terracing structure allowing engineers to widen and equalize the wall-walk. It also supported a higher agger and functioned as a secondary parapet, setting up two lines of defense against attackers. (Anon, n.d.) The overall increased height provided cover for neighboring houses, as well as for troops and supplies moving along a street that ran along the inner base of the fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) The internal wall also relieved the outer curtain from the pressure exerted by the agger, which had probably caused many previous collapses. A series of regularly spaced internal piers mirroring those on the external curtain further stabilized the structure. Although tufa composes the majority of the wall a few interspersed limestone blocks derive from the partial demolition of the old terracing wall on the city side of the agger. 331 Where 328 See Chiaramonte Trerè,\"The Walls and Gates,\" 142. For a full summary of the debate see Sakai, \"La storia sotto il suolo del 79 d.C.,\" 90-92, and Brands Republikanische Stadttore in Italien, 174-176. 329 J.P. Adam, L'Architecture militaire Grecque (Paris, 1982), 41. 330 Richardson, Pompeii: An Architectural History, 45. 331 Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 159-162. exposed, the tufa blocks often still carry prominent quarry marks attesting to a very well organized production and construction process administering the operation. The intervention, however, is not uniform and the internal wall finds a place only in those areas most vulnerable to attacks. Isolated sections on the western side of the city still feature large parts of limestone curtain where their double function as terracing walls ensured their preservation. Despite its inherent advantages, the internal wall is notably missing at the Porta Stabia and at Tower IX where a remnant of the orthostate wall supported a lower agger. (Sakai & Iorio, 2005) East of the Porta Vesuvio the new internal wall actually acted as the terrace holding back the agger until an opus incertum wall, likely built in conjunction with the later towers, accommodated its expansion further south. (Seiler, n.d.) A large tufa stairway offering access to the wall walk replaces it between the Porta Ercolano and Tower XII. The internal reinforcement is also absent near the amphitheater, although this circumstance is probably related to its demolition to make way for the arena. Excavations beneath the Temple of Venus point to the presence of a single tufa terracing wall dating to the early third century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) In light of the natural strength of the Pompeian plateau, it is questionable whether the full defensive system continued farther east toward the Doric Temple. Here, although the terrace received some new tufa masonry, the desire to maintain the view probably precluded the presence of an extensive agger. 335 Although the internal wall is not consistent, the addition of several courses of tufa ashlars on the external curtain largely is. The intervention on the north side of the fortifications increased its height from eight to eleven meters, creating a dramatic contrast with the earlier limestone masonry. (Anon, n.d.) The battlements of both walls have now completely disappeared. According to the earliest descriptions they included L-shaped merlons extending onto the internal piers reinforcing the façade. This shape best covered the front and left sides of the defenders, while liberating their right arms to pelt the enemy with projectiles (fig. 33). (Anon, n.d.) Today only three capping stones still lie in the vicinity of the battlements; one on the wall-walk west of Tower XII, and two just outside of the Porta Nocera. All three bear signs of a joint on the top right, suggesting that they originally capped the inner pier. An extended cornice, lined with spouts to drain rainwater from the wall-walk, marked the transition between the curtain and the parapet but scholars are again divided on its appearance. The recovery of a spout carved to resemble a lion's head outside of the Porta Stabia is a case in point. Excavators first thought it was the keystone to the arch of the gate, but August Mau identified it as a spout and projected it as adorning the entire circuit. (Anon, n.d.) The piece has since disappeared and only survives in an old photograph that restored it next to the outer bastion of the gate. Extending the presence of the type on the entire fortification is a little far-fetched and some scholars, including Maiuri, tend to ignore it. Others prefer to view it as adorning (Anon, n.d.)

(Anon, n.d.) As we shall see below, recent research has called the presence of spouts for this phase into question on account of their survival in much later masonry. Scholars have otherwise invariably placed them in their reconstruction of this phase of the walls. (Anon, n.d.) Beyond the ambiguities of decorative details, a quick glance at the medley of masonry composing the surviving fortifications does not suggest a uniform appearance for this phase. A brief survey of the evidence, however, proves otherwise. This is particularly the case on the south-east of the city where the limestone blocks between Towers II and IV reach six to eight courses high and still dominate the curtain. At first glance this façade is composed entirely of limestone in a very different fashion than the rest of the circuit for this phase. However, a closer look at the evidence indicates that four courses of completely unworked blocks at the bottom of the wall were once hidden from view in a foundation trench. Their exposure is the result of soil erosion accelerated first by the cutting back of the cliff to make the wall more inaccessible, and a later lowering of the terrain to ease access through the Porta Nocera in the early colony. (Anon, n.d.) Proof comes from the similarly exposed foundations of Tower III, the Porta Nocera, and particularly Tower II which still displays a high floating postern (fig.35). 342 A few surviving tufa blocks east of the Tower II confirm a layout more consistent with the rest of the circuit. They sit above nine limestone courses. If we subtract the lowest four courses as buried 339 Krischen, Die Stadtmauern von Pompeij,plate 5. 340 Starting with Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1 pl.

The remaining tufa blocks, including large parts of the Porta Nocera, disappeared after earthquake of 62 CE to provide much-needed building material for the ensuing reconstruction effort. (Anon, n.d.) The next evident limestone/tufa juxtaposition runs between Tower V and the Porta Sarno. Here the number of lower limestone courses varies considerably, ranging between three and six in number. We must consider, however, that in all probability twentieth-century restorations/repairs form large sections of curtain, since modern cement holds much of it together and the tufa blocks carry modern tool marks. The exact height of the limestone is therefore difficult to trace, but minor variations in the number of courses were likely difficult to notice when viewed from below considering the high ridge supporting the walls (fig. 36). Continuing from the Porta Sarno we find the most regular limestone/tufa setup of the entire circuit between Tower VII and the Porta Nola. The number of upper tufa courses varies according to their survival rate. The lowest limestone blocks form a consistent level platform of three courses (fig. 37). Admittedly, excavations here could potentially reveal further lower courses, but the platform is remarkably consistent. A similar situation exists between Porta Nola and Tower VIII. The first twenty-seven meters directly west of the gate display four lower limestone courses supporting two surviving in tufa. A section some twenty-three meters long follows with five lower limestone courses of slightly smaller block dimensions that may belong to a later refurbishment (fig. 38). A subsequent heavily damaged and most probably spoliated section only displays three limestone courses and no tufa. The next thirty meters leading up to Tower VIII are more regular; two lower limestone courses support between four and ten blocks of surviving tufa. (Anon, n.d.) Further west, the section running from the Porta Vesuvio to the mid-mark between Tower X and XI displays an identical setup where four lower limestone courses support the tufa framework above. Today the juxtaposition is not immediately apparent since much of the limestone is buried beneath an earth fill dating to the early Imperial age and a large dump of debris resulting from the 62 CE earthquake. (Anon, n.d.) The façade, perhaps the most intact of the circuit, is remarkably consistent, with grey tufa as the primary construction material, a few lonely brown tufa blocks, and a rare limestone ashlar west of the tower (fig. 39). (Anon, n.d.) The blocks are uniform in size, about 41-42 cm high, with slightly taller stones of 67 cm expressly highlighting the parapet. (Anon, n.d.) The wall face changes slightly twenty meters west of Tower X where the socle increases to six courses and the parapet displays a few courses of later repairs using limestone. The curtain continues west as a patchwork of tufa and opus incertum materials with a consistent limestone socle up to the completely re-built tufa wall associated with an earlier phase of the current Porta Ercolano. The west side of the city features a prominent differentiation of construction techniques due, in part, to the function of the wall as a terrace. The consequent high (Anon, n.d.)

Maiuri, \"Pompei isolamento della cinta murale,\" 279. (Anon, n.d.) They have a diverse erosion rate with the grey type more resistant to elements. Despite the divergence the difference the appearance is actually very subtle. (Anon, n.d.) A recent investigation notes that the courses on either side of the tower are slightly misaligned. See Hori, \"Pompeian Town Walls and Opus Quadratum,\" 286. See also Y. Hori, O. Ajioka, and A.

The article however ignores the large allied aircraft bomb that destroyed the curtain west of tower X in 1943 and its subsequent reconstruction as possible reason for the incongruous appearance. See García y García, Danni di guerra a Pompei (Rome, 2006), 164. stresses on the masonry probably led to frequent collapses and substantial repairs.foot_104 The limestone curtain is still evident on either side of the Porta Marina and the previously mentioned section beneath the House of Fabius Rufus. The neighboring House of Maius Castricius (VII.16.17), however, again displays a very well finished tufa framework resting on a few courses of limestone. Beyond the Porta Marina, the southwest ridge of the city again shows a unique set of circumstances. Recent excavations beneath the Temple of Venus uncovered the remains of a tufa terracing wall built at the turn of the third century BCE.foot_105 This date is much earlier than the rest of the upgrade, and the use of tufa may relate to an earlier effort to highlight the prestige and prominence of the area. This seems especially the case if, as discussed in the previous chapter, we consider that a similar use of materials deliberately differentiated to the tower extending in front of the Porta Vesuvio.foot_106 Turning the corner toward the Doric Temple the wall disappears beneath and is embedded into later houses. A study of the area conducted by Noack and Lehmann-Hartleben identifies nine surviving sections of the exterior walls spaced out between Houses VIII.2.29-36. Terrace 20 in House VIII.2.29 in particular, displays two tufa blocks still carrying mason marks flanking a limestone block still in situ. Terrace 19 in House VIII.2.30 displays a similar superimposition of construction techniques, with Sarno limestone blocks incorporated into later opus incertum masonry and still partially covered in stucco. (Anon, n.d.) Finally a small tract of wall composed of two tufa courses surmounting a limestone socle survive as a terrace for the Triangular Forum (fig. 14). As is the case with the previous enceintes the fortifications on this side of the city functioned primarily as a terrace and lacked the agger. In this role the fortifications would dictate the orientation of the houses and preserve their memory in the streets and the outskirts of the area. The work on the external curtain is, at first glance, a simple reinforcement. If this represents the original height of the limestone framework with tufa additions, however, then the previous fortifications were too low for an effective defensive curtain rising, on average, only some three to four courses (fig. 40). Scholarship has struggled to explain this situation or often chosen to ignore it. The recent excavations near Tower IX propose a different scenario pointing to a short time interval between the limestone and tufa curtains. (Anon, n.d.) These results suggest that the first Samnite wall perhaps never reached full completion before its upgrade. It might very well be that the lower limestone courses first supported a superstructure in perishable materials, such as wood or mud-brick, later substituted with tufa. (Anon, n.d.) In fact, engineers often applied a stone socle as a common remedy to protect mud-brick walls from rainwater damage, and this hypothesis might explain the relative regularity of the lower courses. (Anon, n.d.) Furthermore, Vitruvius specifically recommended travertine as an ideal material for wall foundations due to its load bearing capacity. (Anon, n.d.) Although no evidence exists for a mudbrick superstructure, these factors suggest that the limestone socle was a deliberate choice and is not entirely arbitrary. The switch from limestone may have occurred for a number of reasons, including the simple exhaustion of quarries, or the discovery of tufa as a more versatile 352 Sakai and Iorio, \"Nuove ricerche del Japan Institute of Paleological Studies sulla fortificazione di Pompei,\" 328. 353 Sakai, \"La storia sotto il suolo del 79 d.C.,\" 94. 354 Winter, Greek Fortifications, 62. 355 Virtuvius II.7.2. construction material. 356 As a result, the Japanese team recently concluded that the previous limestone phase probably never existed and that the two materials actually represent one phase. 357 Such a notion is not unique to Pompeian scholarship and to a certain extent falls back to the hypothesis of a single grand foundation for the city. The very regularity and alignment of the two walls composing the fortifications have led Overbeck and Richardson to a similar conclusion. 358 Curious, and little noticed by successive scholars, is Maiuri's own admission of this possibility when he uncovered the walls and Tower III south of the Palestra. 359 This kind of debate is symptomatic of the scholarship on the city walls at Pompeii, creating an often confusing and divergent set of ideas. Even to this day, however, Maiuri's excavations remain the most exhaustive in their exploration of the entire circuit and his account is generally accepted as the most accurate in terms of building sequence of the walls. 360 With the exception of Sakai's perishable materials hypothesis, none of the theories satisfactorily explain the low height of the limestone courses throughout most of the circuit. If anything this might be conclusive evidence that the limestone/tufa wall represents a single construction event. Scholars recognize similar uses of distinct materials for decorative effects in the ninth century BCE fortifications of Old Smyrna and in the late Archaic walls of Buruncuk-Larisa in Greece. 361 Nevertheless, we may consider 356 The exhaustion hypothesis seems especially plausible if we consider that construction crews actively sought out and used the quarries closest to the city walls as a measure of expediency. Lugli, La tecnica edilizia romana, 65-69. 357 Etani, Pompeii: Report of the excavation at Porta Capua, 1993-2005, 308. 358 Overbeck, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken (Leipzig, 1854), 40-41. Richardson, Pompeii: An Architectural History, 45. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Muro della fortificazione,\" 233 the scholar noted the similarity of the quarry marks on both walls which, along with an almost uniform size of the tufa and limestone blocks, and an alignment of the piers, suggest a single construction effort. (Anon, n.d.) Chiaramonte Treré, \"The Walls and Gates,\" 141. (Anon, n.d.) See Winter, Greek Fortifications, 79-80. that engineers perhaps deliberately shaved off significant sections of the limestone to actually seek out a distinct aesthetic effect while building the walls. The application of these two construction materials results in a very distinct effect of chiaroscuro-all the more evident when rain water accentuates their colors (figs. 32, 35-38). This factor likely represents an explicit decorative effect applied to the walls since the number of courses of each material, although varying slightly, actually displays a marked consistency. If the tufa does represent a distinct later construction phase, the differentiation of materials marks the extent of the intervention and signals the amount of work and investment carried out on the fortifications. This is a clear stamp upon the walls and, by extension, a projection of power upon the city by those financing the refurbishment. However, if we consider, as early scholarship did, that the limestone and tufa actually represent a single construction event, then the aesthetic consideration behind this façade is all the more evident. In any event, the contrasting effect of materials played a significant role in the appearance of the walls, and-as we shall see-throughout the city. Along with the reinforcement of the curtain walls during the tufa period, modifications to the gates -based on the forecourt prototype of the Porta Stabia highlighted in the previous chapter-began to shape their appearance. According to Maiuri, their refurbishment included substituting the limestone of the gate-court with tufa, and building a vault marking the threshold into the city. (Anon, n.d.) The Porta Nola, as the best preserved example, formed the basis of his chronology and he readily identified the tufa blocks in the opus incertum masonry of the later vault as relics of an older arch, with the most noticeable functioning as struts for the double-doored internal gate (fig. 41). The protome of Minerva, the keystone of the current arch, along with a few voussoirs and an adjacent inscription, belonged to the earlier vault and represented examples of continuity or nostalgia. A stylistic comparison between the bust and carved capitals decorating house doorways in the city supplied Maiuri with a tentative date of 200-150 BCE for the first arch. (Anon, n.d.) Much of this theory is highly debatable and any further evidence for this substitution of arches is otherwise completely lacking, inducing many to believe that the tufa vaults never existed. (Anon, n.d.) Regarding the gate court walls, the substitution thesis is equally problematic but to a certain extent seems more plausible as some sort of retaining wall must have held back the earth to allow passage through the agger. Recent excavations at the Porta Vesuvio have identified a foundation trench dating the construction of the western wing to the late third and mid-second century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) The new passageway walls served to further accentuate the tripartite layout of the gates discussed in the previous chapter for the Porta Stabia. In addition, we find the same contrast of differing construction techniques with the court walls laid as orthostates in direct opposition to the horizontal ashlars of the bastions. These elements are clearly visible in the Porta Nocera, Sarno, Nola, and Vesuvio, where the passageway blocks contrast markedly with the limestone masonry of the bastions (fig. 42). (Anon, n.d.) The subtlety of the Porta Stabia design gives way to a far more marked differentiation to the functional elements of the gate. More importantly, the limestone/tufa juxtaposition dialogues directly with the outer curtain, suggesting the presence of an overarching aesthetic in the design of the fortifications. More evidence for this factor and, perhaps, its long-term continuity comes from the Porta Nocera. The gate repeats the familiar layout: outer limestone bastions, followed by a tufa gate court and a concrete vault. A lowering of the road passing through it in the late Republican-early Augustan period revealed the opus incertum foundations (fig. 43). (Anon, n.d.) With regard to the fortifications, scholars usually associate the use of opus incertum solely with the later construction of the vaults and the towers. The concrete at Porta Nocera, however, displays a seamless transition between the vault and the foundations. Furthermore, the steps buried in the agger on the west side of the passageway suggest that a gateway already existed here in the first limestone enceinte. Unless the inner walls were lifted and put back into place, which seems unlikely, the passageway and vault are the result of a single construction event using concrete and tufa. (Anon, n.d.) This sequence directly counters Maiuri's substitution hypothesis and points to the construction of the court and vault occurring in a single event. It also leaves us with some important observations. The current layout of the Porta Nocera is possibly a late addition directly emulating other gates in the city, or a later refurbishment carefully restoring the tufa masonry, or the gates are part of a single construction event perhaps associated with the towers. In any event, these scenarios each contain an element of universal design, 367 D'Ambrosio and De Caro, Un impegno per Pompei, 24. A few elements confirm that these are indeed the foundations. The lowest blocks still carry quarry marks, as opposed to the smoothly dressed higher courses, suggesting that they were once buried and hidden from view. Further elements confirming the original height of the road are the unduly high sidewalks leading up to the gate and the tufa struts in the vault. They once supported the original closing gate and now hang high above the exposed foundations. (Anon, n.d.) Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 34. suggesting a deliberate consideration of uniform aesthetics and presentation for the city and its walls. Given the uncertainties concerning the date of the first introduction of opus incertum at Pompeii, the Porta Nocera also forms an important piece of evidence for the early use of this construction technique. Giving an exact date for the construction of the gate remains difficult. The tombs in front of the gate provide a terminus ante quem for the lowering of the road and hence construction of the gate to the early Roman colony, 369 whereas the tufa addition to the nearby curtain likely occurred at the start of the second century BCE. Perhaps most importantly, the recent excavations of the passageways at the Porta Stabia and Vesuvio have not revealed a similar use of opus incertum for their foundations. (Anon, n.d.) In addition, as highlighted further below, new investigations have recently downdated the concrete vault at the Porta Stabia to the early colony. To a certain extent, therefore, it seems that the walls at the Porta Nocera are a laboratory for the application of opus incertum as a new construction technique. However, only further excavations at the gate can pinpoint its date and role in the city more definitively. Further evidence for a concerted representative design element concerning the gates comes from the Porta Ercolano. The gate is currently a three bay monumental arch that replaced an earlier version in the Augustan period or, as a recent re-evaluation suggests, after the earthquake of 62 CE-but we will return to this form later. 371 The 369 D'Ambrosio and De Caro, Un impegno per Pompei, 24 370 Seiler et.al., La Regio VI Insula 16 e la zona della Porta Vesuvio, 224; Devore and Ellis, \"The Third Season of Excavations at VIII.7.1-15 and the Porta Stabia at Pompeii.

November 1993 (München, 1995), 153-159. earlier gate originally featured the familiar tripartite design, including the limestone/tufa sequence, and a powerful offset bastion on the north (fig. 44). Although not unknown in antiquity, the resulting angled entrance design was counter-intuitive to military concerns. As noted above, architects designed the so-called Scaean gate types at an angle to force the enemy to expose their right unshielded side to the defenders. The Porta Ercolano design, as do both the Porta Marina and Nola, does the opposite and the reasons are probably related to the layout of the original terrain. Maiuri's excavations demonstrate that the northern bastion sat on a small natural terrace that influenced the orientation of the gate and added a more formidable aspect of the fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) The oblique angle has also led scholars to speculate that the previous road aligned with the via Superior currently passing in front of the Villa dei Misteri. (Anon, n.d.) Despite the design variation compared to the other gates in the city and its almost complete disappearance, the Samnite Porta Ercolano included the same differentiation of materials explicitly highlighting the entrance into the city. Furthermore, a representative element is clearly at work in the remaining wall that once ended in the northern bastion. Littered with scars from the Sullan siege, the fourteen-course section still displays some of the highest quality finished masonry of the entire circuit. (Anon, n.d.) This is hardly surprising, considering that the gate straddled the via Consolare, one of busiest roads in the region tying Pompeii with Naples, and connecting through the via Domitiana with Rome. 375 This prime location is also the reason why the monumental arch eventually replaced the 372 Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 132-133.

Although the Samnite gate has now largely disappeared, it seems that its design and the use of tufa reflected the wider aesthetic considerations concerning the walls in one of the most visible and frequented entrances to the city. Neighboring Porta Vesuvio presents its own unique variation of the basic plan (fig. 14). As noted earlier, the gate is placed at the most vulnerable point of the defenses and it responded to its weak position with the addition of a forward tower extending from its western flank. The tufa refurbishment filled in the tower, transforming it into a forward bastion incorporated into the wall curtain. Although it is badly damaged, excavations have shown that a similar bastion extended in front of the gate's eastern flank. The resulting layout transformed the gate into a formidable defensive outpost where the double tufa and limestone bastions created a deadly cul-de-sac (fig. 45). This strategic consideration explains why, unlike the other gates of the city, the Porta Vesuvio featured a closing gate on the field side of the limestone bastions so defenders could isolate attackers more effectively. As discussed further in the next chapter, two altars dedicated to unspecified deities protected the walls and those passing through the liminal passageway into the city. (Anon, n.d.) Behind the forward entrance, the familiar gate court built in tufa isodomic masonry extended into the city. Whether, as Sogliano suggested, another vault once existed on the city side of the gate remains unclear due to the heavy damage it sustained during the earthquake. (Anon, n.d.) Despite the alterations, the gate again staged a powerful three-step entry into the city, with the only exception that the curtain rather than (Anon, n.d.) See Sogliano, \"Relazione degli scavi fatti dal Dicembre 1902 a tutto Marzo 1905,\" 99-100. 377 Recent excavations did not conclusively resolve the issue since any internal vault likely succumbed much earlier to make way for the neighboring Augustan castellum aquae See Seiler et.al, \"La regio VI insula 16 e la zona della porta Vesuvio,\" 219-224 and 230-233. the limestone bastions announced the passage into the city. The masonry again highlighted the transition, further reinforced by the limestone/tufa juxtaposition of the adjacent wall curtain. With the main framework of the defenses now in place, the next intervention on the fortifications occurred in the last quarter of the second century BCE. In these years Pompeii achieved its developmental peak before the outbreak of the Social War and the public buildings erected in this period embody its status as an independent city before the establishment of the colony in 80 BCE. According to the traditional view, the work conducted on the walls included the addition of the towers, a decorative vault on each of the gates, and the reconstruction of large parts of the outer curtain. We have seen, however, that the remains of the Porta Nocera and Porta Stabia suggest a more complicated construction sequence that needs further investigation outside of the present thesis. Nevertheless, engineers resorted to opus incertum as their technique of choice to erect the towers and gate vaults. The material is a cheap form of cement faced with irregular, fist-sized stones allowing rapid construction and adaptability to molds; it is usually covered with stucco to mask its crudity. Scholars currently equate most of these works as a response to the gathering clouds of the Social War, but it is hard to assess this kind of foresight. In fact, the upgrade may also represent a reaction to the very real threat posed by Rome's war with the Cimbri and the Teutones that included battles in the Po valley. In any event, Pompeii fits into a general trend of the late second and first centuries BCE when cities throughout Italy increasingly upgraded or built new defenses. (Anon, 1986) This activity is part of a wider tendency of Italian settlements to add the essential architectural elements such as theaters, baths, temples, and fortifications, to complete their image as a city. (Anon, n.d.) The extent of this refurbishment is especially problematic to pinpoint regarding Romanelli, sees the opus incertum as repairs conducted after the Sullan siege. (Romanelli, n.d.) Mazois, in a theory recently revived by Richardson, carried this idea further by also including the towers to the post-Sullan period, built in response to the civil war under Caesar. (Mazois & Pompéi, 1855) Niccolini and Overbeck-Mau subsequently dismissed the notion, believing that the sections are too extensive to represent the damage of a single siege. (Niccolini & Niccolini, 1862) Soon afterward, Sogliano discovered the graffito with the letters L.SULA in Tower XI and ascribed it to a victorious Roman soldier who scratched it into the stucco as a reference to L. Sulla in the aftermath of the siege (fig. 8). (Anon, n.d.) Mau subsequently suggested that the peace following the Second Punic War led to the abandonment of the fortifications and their spoliation for building material. A panicked restoration at the outbreak of the Social War led to the opus incertum wall plugs and the construction of the towers. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri navigated either side of the debate proposing that the opus incertum can represent both pre-and post-Social War construction activity, but placed the towers firmly in the last quarter of the second century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) The proponents of the theory advocating a temporary abandonment of the city walls commonly point to the development of the southwest portion of the city as a key argument. (Anon, n.d.) In the late second century BCE private dwellings started encroaching upon the walls to exploit the grand views toward the Monti Lattari and the Sorrento peninsula to the south and west (fig. 46). This development certainly weakened the defenses in this part of the city, but the precise extent of the occupation remains somewhat unclear. As we have seen, the steep precipice in the sector needed few supplementary defenses beyond terracing walls, and most houses featured grand terraces on the ridge which troops could still occupy and use defensively if necessary. (Anon, n.d.) The defenses therefore could still withstand long protracted sieges and it is only after the establishment of the colony that houses eventually enveloped the walls. In short, assigning the construction of all the curtain walls built in opus incertum Another analysis similarly proposes that the opus incertum east of the Porta Ercolano represents a post-siege repair. (Anon, n.d.) The reality is that repairs and reconstructions, especially those using similar construction materials, are generally very difficult to pinpoint, let alone to date. Further compounding the problem is the ubiquitous use of both tufa and opus incertum in the period, often in the same structures. Beyond a stucco veneer, tufa, and later also marble, covered the cement, ensuring its use well into the Roman colony. (Anon, n.d.) The result is an uncertain periodization which only further systematic excavations can clear up. 388 CIL X 937. Fiorelli, Gli scavi di Pompei dal 1861 Al 1872, 89.

See Hori, \"Pompeian Town Walls and Opus Quadratum,\" 288-289. We should keep in mind however, that such a conclusion rests on the notion that only Roman builders used this measurement. This fact remains hard to prove and only if we dismiss the possibility of itinerant architects providing technical know-how. (Anon, n.d.) The schola tombs outside of the gates are just one of many examples. In the absence of further evidence, we can perhaps draw some educated guesses. For example, the tract south of the amphitheater probably relates to the arena's construction, which also led to the partial removal of the agger and the demolition of the internal wall. Similarly, the sections outside the Porta Nola, Porta Stabia, and the north side of the city, probably necessitated extensive repairs; they probably bore the brunt of heavy attacks during the Sullan siege because of their vulnerable position. Other sections functioning as terraces immediately west and east of the Temple of Venus are probably related to housing construction or the refurbishment of the sanctuary occurring in the first century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) For the sake of my analysis I will assume that most opus incertum sections in the curtain largely represent colonial repairs, with the hope that future excavations and studies will further clarify the situation. (Anon, n.d.) With these issues in mind, a few distinctions in the ashlar masonry suggest that some curtain refurbishments occurred using the limestone/tufa framework. Maiuri identified a small section of limestone and tufa curtain some forty-seven meters west of Tower XI that is less finished and homogenous, and may represent a repair (fig. 31). (Anon, n.d.) Similarly, Chiaramonte Trerè pinpointed a twenty-three meter stretch of wall located twenty-seven meters west of the Porta Nola where slightly smaller limestone blocks may represent a later refurbishment. (Anon, n.d.) Nearby, Hori recently recognized repairs carried out on the curtains flanking Towers VII and VIII during their construction. (Anon, n.d.) In each case, these (Anon, n.d.) For these results see E. Curti, \"La Venere Fisica Trionfante: Un nuovo ciclo di iscrizioni dal santuario di venere a Pompei.\" In Il filo e le perle. studi per i 70 anni di Mario Torelli (Venosa, 2007), 72. (Anon, n.d.) Hori's investigations complicate matters further. His metrological analysis of the blocks between Towers XI and XII, suggests the use of freshly quarried blocks of Sarno limestone in post-Sullan repairs.

Hori, \"Pompeian Town Walls and Opus Quadratum,\" 293. refurbishments imitated the previous opus quadratum layout including the limestone/tufa sequence, pointing to a conscious desire to preserve the appearance of the walls. Beyond the issue of the individual curtain sections, the battlements they supported significantly changed their role and appearance. The insertion of the towers led engineers to lower the agger to ease the access into the new buildings, thereby revealing much of the undressed masonry and the quarry marks on the blocks of the internal wall. (Anon, n.d.) More importantly, the secondary inner parapet largely disappeared, moving the line forward and pinning defense on the dominating height and firepower of the towers (fig. 47). 399 The new layout also led engineers to pierce new access points to the wall-walk through the internal wall. A clear example, walled up at an unspecified later date, still exists between Towers X and XI where a small postern cut into the tufa blocks still connects with the agger elegantly sloped to reach it with ease. Recently Russo and Russo have proposed a radical alternative to the traditional reconstruction of the walls for this phase. Rather than seeing the inner tufa wall as the relic of a secondary parapet, they envision it as supporting the rear of a roof covering the entire wall-walk sloping toward the field-side of the walls (fig. 48). They attribute the complete disappearance of the roof to the systematic destruction of the wall-walk to demilitarize the wall after the Sullan siege. A subsequent reconstruction effort conducted in the early colony included patching up the walls with opus incertum and the addition of spouts needed to drain rain water from the open battlements. (Anon, n.d.) Both roofed wall-walks and the demolition of battlements are not unknown in antiquity; they carried the distinct (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 120 this is most evident in the section between the Porta Vesuvio and Ercolano. (Anon, n.d.) On the strategic advantages of towers see Adam, L'Architecture militaire Grecque, 46-76 400 F. Russo and F. Russo, 89 a.C.: Assedio a Pompei: La dinamica e le tecnologie belliche della conquista sillana di Pompei (Pompei, 2005), 71-75. For the post Sullan spouts see also Hori, \"Pompeian Town Walls and Opus Quadratum,\" 286. advantage of protecting defending troops from the elements and enemy missiles. (Anon, n.d.) Their removal was a military tactic aimed at prohibiting their further use and symbolized the loss of independence of a community by crippling their ability to defend themselves. (Anon, n.d.) A main problem with the theory, however, is the complete lack of any further supporting archaeological evidence, and with much of the battlements now gone their reconstruction remains difficult to prove. Only a curtain section fifteen meters east of Tower XII displays a top course of vertical limestone orthostates alternating tufa spouts set on ashlar masonry. Unless they also represent repairs to the battlements, their presence disproves the theory of a previously covered wall-walk. The only truly intact part of the wall top comes from a section of the city walls on the northwestern tip of the vicolo dei Soprastanti. Here six limestone columns engaged in the same opus incertum masonry of the curtain below stand to demarcate the edge of the road from the cliff below (fig. 49). Stylistic analysis of the Doric capitals suggests their contemporaneity with the towers. (Anon, n.d.) The absence of battlements implies that the wall here did not carry much military value with the minor exception of a small triangular slot designed perhaps as viewing window, or as a firing slit covering the adjacent walls below. Although it has now completely disappeared, stucco very similar to that covering the towers probably decorated this stretch of walls. With little military value, the section clearly formed a purely decorative marker emphasizing the edge of the city. No other part of the circuit better highlights the desire to embellish the fortifications, and its presence (Anon, n.d.) The walls at Athens representing a prominent example of the type Adam, L'Architecture militaire Grecque, 39. (Anon, n.d.) The victor did not always fully demolish the defenses, but often took measures to demilitarize the structures in such a way to prohibit their effective use in military operations see Lawrence, Greek Aims in Fortification, 115 and J. McK. Camp II, \"Walls and the Polis.\" In Polis and Politics Studies in Ancient Greek History (Copenhagen, 2000), 48. 403 Cassetta and Constantino, \"Vivere sulle mura,\" 200. Also, M. Aoyagi and U. Pappalardo, Pompei. Regiones VI -VII, Insula Occidentalis, 1 (Naples, 2006) 19-22. here is hardly coincidental since it accompanies some of the grandest terrace houses of the later city. The use of opus incertum in the vaults of four gates, the Porta Stabia, Nocera, Sarno, and Nola, has led scholars to date them to the same period as the towers. As mentioned above this view is debatable, and recent excavations at the Porta Stabia concluded that its vault in particular is likely a post-colonial construction. (Anon, n.d.) Although construction of the vaults is perhaps more haphazard than previously thought, their addition and overall embellishments are part of a grander design that completed the tripartite passage through the agger. The Porta Nola, the best surviving example of the type, highlights how the juxtaposition of limestone, tufa, and stucco accentuated the transition (fig. 42). Its current appearance is a prime example of private euergetism benefitting the city. An Oscan inscription, once encased in the masonry next to the bust of Minerva and now in the British Museum, described how the meddix, or magistrate, Vibius Popidius the son of Vibius, constructed and dedicated the gate (fig. 50). (Anon, n.d.) It reads: v. půpidiis v | med tův | aamanaffed, | isidu | pruphatted 406 404 Devore and Ellis, \"The Third Season of Excavations at VIII.7.1-15 and the Porta Stabia at Pompeii. Preliminary Report,\" 14. 405 According to Mazois, Mau, and Maiuri The inscription first went to Paris see Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1, 27. Also see Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 46; Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 213; Nissen Pompeianische Studien,511; Conway The Italic Dialects, (Cambridge, 1897), 45 mentions that it ended up in the British Museum 406 R. Conway The Italic Dialects, 45; E. Vetter, Handbuch der Italischen Dialekte (Heidelberg, 1953), Ve 22. Vibius, a rather rich wine trader belonging to the powerful Popidii clan, also built the tufa colonnade still partially surviving on the south side of the Forum. (Anon, n.d.) We shall return to the significance below, but for the sake of clarity the First-Style decorative scheme usually featured a formulaic scheme consisting sequentially of a socle, followed by orthostates, ashlars and topped with a frieze. Stabia and Porta Nola he describes the vault interiors as carrying a yellow elevated socle receding into a simple smooth white plane above. 410 Such a scheme is relatively straightforward, but the Mau explicitly warns against seeing too much simplicity in the decoration, and praises the stucco itself as the highest achievable quality. (Anon, n.d.) We find some solace in the earliest depictions of the gates, although their usefulness is often lessened by their schematic nature due to the abandoned or re-buried state of the structures. (Anon, n.d.) Furthermore, they are often black and white prints of engravings with limited detail and exclude any colors on the gates. French architect Mazois produced some of the earliest and most accurate renditions. His cross-section of the Porta Nola in particular reveals an apparent election notice painted onto the tufa of the passageway and an important detail: the lack of stucco covering the masonry of the gate court and the outer bastions (fig. 51). The decorative effect of the gates therefore included the bare masonry, creating a contrast between the inner vaults and highlighting the individual steps of passage. The depictions of the Porta Nola, including an engraving published by William Gell, also reveal a far greater surviving extent of the stucco on the vault, with sections of smooth plaster still in situ next to the inscription and the female bust. (Anon, n.d.) Neither author emphasizes Mau's yellow socle which, although discolored, is still distinguishable today. There is no trace of the imitative ashlars typical of the First-Style found on the towers and Porta Ercolano, but with so much of the evidence gone it is hard 410 A. Mau, Pompejanische Beiträge (Berlin, 1879), 236. 411 A. Mau, Geschichte der Decorativen Wandmalerei in Pompeji (Berlin, 1882), 58. See previously Gell, who describes the stucco as finest quality on towers and gates. W. Gell Pompeiana: The Topography, Edifices and Ornaments of Pompeii (London, 1832), 90. 412 Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 52, for example, refer the reader to Mazois for the buried sections of the Porta Nola. 413 Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1, plate XXXVI fig. 1 and 2; Mazois incidentally distrusts the placement of this inscription, as Maiuri, does after him as well, attributing it perhaps to a restoration of an earlier vault. 153. See Gell, Pompeiana, pl. 29. to assess the embellishments on the vaults with any greater certainty. It may very well be that the stucco on different gates featured slight variations, responding perhaps to differing construction or restoration events, the wishes of different patrons, or even, as we shall below, their placement and association with particular districts of the city. Complicating the matter further is the large gap between their first construction and the eruption, a period in which the individual structures may have changed their appearance. A Eschebach points out that it likely functioned as an (Anon, n.d.) See next chapter for further discussion. (Anon, n.d.) Aoyagi and Pappalardo, Pompei. Regiones VI -VII, Insula Occidentalis, 491-493. overflow for a system of cisterns set slightly further uphill, but damage wrought on the area by allied bombing makes this claim unverifiable. (Anon, n.d.) It seems evident therefore that most of the planning of the city street drainage system accompanied the construction of the inner vaults, if not earlier. These events are hardly surprising, suggesting that the concern for civic décor also included proper drainage systems for the city streets. The choice of using the gates for this role is mostly practical as they naturally tend to be downslope on the easiest access routes into the city and were part of the public land of the fortifications. Gates on the upslope side of the city, such as the Porta Ercolano, do not include any drainage system, whereas the Porta Vesuvio later became the arrival point of the aqueduct into the city. From a military perspective drains could actually weaken the circuit by providing access points into the city and their presence near the gates made them more defensible. (Anon, n.d.) More importantly, the drains also strengthened the notion of control on all things entering and exiting the city. This notion also relates to the sulcus primigenius ritual where gates were the designated interruptions in the protective boundary allowing all impure earthly things to pass through. (Anon, n.d.) Religious symbols also formed an important aspect to the overall decorative program of the gates. Perhaps the most recognized religious symbol is the keystone on the city side of the Porta Nola (figs. 41 and 50). Today much of it is damaged beyond recognition except for a few identifiable locks of curled hair and the base of a helmet on the neck. A certain amount of controversy has surrounded the sculpture ever since its discovery due, in part, to its poor state of preservation and the translation of the inscription. Scholars first mistranslated the last two words of the inscription, isidu pruphatted, as meaning that Vibius Popidius dedicated the vault to Isis and concluded that the carving represented the Egyptian goddess. A later translation identified the words as \"dedicated it\" and changed the identification of the head to Minerva because of the helmet she wears. (Anon, n.d.) Presumably such busts decorated more than just one of the gates at Pompeii but no others were found in situ. Olga Elia describes another keystone, unfortunately without context, conserved at the antiquarium. The heavily damaged head probably depicts a female figure. Although it might resemble a keystone, we can draw no further conclusions since it may come from other vaults (fig.53). 422 In fact, the only other carved keystone still in situ in the city decorates the access arch of the western dromos in the main theatre and depicts either Dionysus or a Satyr. 423 Other gates carry divergent religious references. On the north side of the city the Porta Vesuvio displays the remains of a lararium on the western tip of the gate. Today much of the evidence has disappeared but Sogliano describes the recovery of two altars in the cul-de-sac on the northwest side of the gate during his excavations of in the early twentieth century (fig. 54). Stucco and fresco once covered the altars and walls above them, but any identifiable signs had already deteriorated beyond recognition at the time of excavation. Presumably, as with so many other lararia throughout the city, the fresco depicted the public lares protecting the city, but any further interpretation is elusive. 424 421 The most complete engraving of the bust is on the cover of De Clarac and Mori, Fouille faite à Pompei.

Construction of the Renaissance city walls obliterated the original context but architect Antonio Sangallo incorporated the decoration into the new walls. and Remus. (Coarelli, 2004) At Volterra the outward façade of the Porta all'Arco still features three heavily eroded heads at the springings and apex of the arch, which some identify as Jupiter and the Dioscuri (fig. 55). As protective gods of the Roman state they symbolically embraced Volterra as a direct extension of its territory, and simultaneously acted as a statement to anyone approaching the gate. (Pasquinucci & Menichelli, 2000) The Porta di Giove at Falerii Novi features a head of Jupiter decorating the keystone. It likely references the city's relationship with Rome since it was responsible for the foundation of the settlement in 273 BCE as a measure to re-locate and control the recalcitrant inhabitants of Falerii Vetres. The fortifications themselves carried further symbolism. They included over fifty towers regularly spaced throughout the circuit even in inaccessible places in no danger of attack. This circumstance is primarily due to the role of fortifications as part of the appropriate presentation of the new city rather than just defensive needs. Along with the Perugian example, Falerii Novi particularly validates the notion that walls developed from purely defensive elements into integral parts of the urban image. (Anon, n.d.) As we shall see in the next chapter, the presence of Minerva on the defenses of Pompeii likely carried a similar political and religious motivation. The elements of representation present in the city gates may also relate to their function as tax barriers. We should keep in mind that the gates fulfilled this function since the first enceinte up to the eruption of Vesuvius, but the expansion of the city led to their increasing importance in this role. In simple terms they were collection points where gatekeepers and tax collectors stopped people and goods passing through. (Anon, n.d.) As stopping points they could also cause congestion on busy streets, especially when engineers designed them primarily as narrow passageways concerned with defense. Gates were important policing barriers and could be shut at night to prevent the uncontrolled passage of people and goods into the city. (Anon, n.d.) In fact, gatekeepers, as the holders of the gate keys, were so important to the safety of the city that Aeneias the Tactician expressly highlights the need to keep a close watch on them and their loyalty during a siege. (Anon, n.d.) The gates therefore also carried with them intrinsic symbolic elements as formal policing barriers related to the state and prevented smuggling. In this role they also functioned as a distinct screen symbolizing the city and its authority. These factors make the architectural correlations between the city walls, the gates, and the urban image all the more compelling. Despite the uncertainties concerning the curtains and gates, the similarities in plan and decoration point to the construction of the towers occurring in a single event. In essence engineers inserted the towers into the curtain by demolishing the outer wall. The buildings consisted of three floors with interconnecting stairways. They straddled the wall-walk and extended slightly beyond each side of the two parapets (fig. 56). A door in During the first excavation of the Porta Ercolano excavators recovered the body of a soldier in the large niche next to the gate. Scholars widely believed that the eruption killed him while standing guard to the gate. See Adams, The Buried Cities of Campania, 50; Clark, Pompei, 73. The niche, however, is an honorary tomb for Marcus Cerrinius Restitutus, see Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 44. 432 On gates in their taxing and policing functions see R.E.A. Palmer, \"Customs on Market Goods Imported into the City of Rome.\" Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome 36 (1980): 217-233; C.

See Aineias the Tactician How to Survive Under Siege Book 5.1. Their role was crucial and he describes many episodes where their bribery or differing political allegiance could lead to the fall of the city if they allowed enemy troops to enter. the back and two on either flank opening onto the wall-walk provided access from the city side, while a small postern at their base opened onto the field side. As evidenced by the buried bastion in the Porta Vesuvio, a distinct possibility exists that these towers replaced earlier versions, 434 but only further archaeological excavations can prove this hypothesis. The reconstructions of the towers divide chronologically along the interpretations provided first by Mazois and later by Maiuri after his 1929 excavations. Each recognized a three-story building but fundamentally differed on the final reconstruction (fig. 57). Mazois believed that the top floor was unroofed; he proposed a small covered stairway in the rear which he decorated with a Doric frieze after the recovery of a few pieces of stucco. He based his reconstruction on an amalgam of the ruined remains of Towers VII, X, XI and XII. With their elevation gone he projected the three window openings on the lowest floor onto those above. (Anon, n.d.) His drawings remained the standard in subsequent publications until Maiuri uncovered substantial pieces of Tower X buried in the volcanic fill in front of it. The pieces allowed him to reconstruct a gabled roof ornamented with a Doric frieze, and four windows on the second and third floors. Maiuri also based his reconstruction on the fresco of the brawl in the amphitheater where the towers clearly show regular roofs. (Anon, n.d.) Curiously, and for reasons that remain unclear to me, the currently rebuilt remains of Tower X feature crenellations rather than a gabled roof. Perhaps this reconstruction follows Mau's suggestion that the pediments were added to the towers when they were demilitarized. (Anon, n.d.) The most recent reconstruction, discussed further (Anon, n.d.) See De Caro, \"Lo sviluppo urbanistico di Pompei,\" 78; Chiaramonte Treré, \"The Walls and Gates,\" 143 for the replacement theory.

Mau, however follows the reconstruction Mazois , proposes and uses this to justify the presence of the pediments in the amphitheater fresco. below, shows the crenellations supporting a sloping roof, but it remains doubtful whether the merlons were strong enough to support the weight. (Anon, n.d.) A number of further questions concerning the towers remain unresolved particularly with regards to the placement of Tower I and the existence of a Tower XIII. Maiuri first suggested a Tower XIII near the Porta Marina based on the presence of opus incertum masonry flanking the gate. Excavations have since proved that this is part of a domestic dwelling built during the colony phase and known as the Villa Imperiale. More concrete evidence exists for Tower I. We know of the existence of at least twelve structures and their counterclockwise numbering through the eituns inscriptions. The inscriptions, a distinct group of six painted in red throughout the city, pointed the way to individual sectors of the fortifications for the eituns, or Samnite troops, defending the city during the Sullan siege. (Anon, n.d.) We shall return to their significance below, for now we can highlight that two of them describe Towers X and XII as the buildings east of Porta Vesuvio and west of Porta Ercolano. With the current number of unearthed towers at eleven and the counterclockwise count, most authors locate Tower I at the western tip of the Triangular Forum. The area is still buried today and excavations announced in 1966 have yet to take place. 440 If a tower did indeed exist here it likely created a stunning visual relationship with the Doric Temple nearby, reinforcing the divine and martial aspects of protecting the city. 438 Russo and Russo, 89 a.C.: Assedio a Pompei, 59. 439 R. Antonini, \"Eítuns a Pompei. Un frammento di DNA italico.\" In Pompei, Capri e la penisola Sorrentina. Atti del quinto ciclo di conferenze di Geologia, Storia e Archeologia (Capri, 2004), 279. 440 H. Van der Poel, Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, 5. Cartography (Austin, 1981), 88. Bonnet actually placed it just west of the Porta Stabia but he did so on an assumption that it would have covered the gate with flanking fire. Subsequent excavations have tended to disprove the theory. See P. Bonnet, \"Pompéi quartier des théatres mémoire P. Bonnet 1858.\" In Pompéi traveaux et envois des architects français au XIX siècle (Naples, 1981), 329. One of the most striking aspects of the towers is their unequal spacing and general indifference to military precepts. Vitruvius and Philon of Byzantium both recommend towers regularly spaced within an arrow's flight to offer mutual cover against attackers. (Anon, n.d.) Ideally they should protrude considerably from the curtain and their designs should be round or polygonal to better resist bombardment and avoid weak corners vulnerable to battering rams. Furthermore, their masonry should be separate from the curtain to prevent large sections on the wall collapsing with it if a tower goes down during the fighting. 442 At Pompeii we find the opposite with square towers almost flush with the wall and concentrated in the most vulnerable areas in the north and southeastern sectors. This layout is invariably related to Pompeian topography. The proximity of the walls to the natural tufa ridge inevitably forced the towers into the curtain. (Anon, n.d.) The ridge, however, carried the distinct advantages of inaccessibility and the look of great height, thereby imparting a formidable appearance to the circuit. The placement of Tower V at the tip of the amphitheater, for example, certainly worked in a defensive context, but also carried decorative and monumental elements giving the entire area the appearance of a fortress (fig. 70). (Anon, n.d.) Although at first glance the siting and concentration of the towers might appear to be primarily related to weaknesses in the circuit, their location is not entirely arbitrary. For instance, the location of Tower X essentially transformed the Porta Vesuvio into a massive Scaean gate by forcing attackers to expose their right unshielded side to direct 441 Vitruvius I.5.4. Philon of Byzantium recommends the same layout in his poliorketika I.20-24. For an English translation see Lawrence Greek Aims in Fortification, 67-107. 442 Phil. Polior. I.62 443 Johannowsky attributes this to the layout of the terrain and the presence of a fossa, forcing the towers into the walls. See W. Johannowsky, \"Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II Sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina.\" In Nuceria Alfaterna e il suo territorio: dalla fondazione ai Longobardi (Nocera Inferiore,1994), 133. 444 Maiuri, \"Pompei. Sterro dei cumuli e isolamento della cinta murale,\" 179. flanking fire (fig. 45). Towers VI, VII, and VIII are spaced exactly halfway between neighboring gates or drastic angles in the circuit. These more isolated buildings essentially acted as small fortresses defending their sectors more effectively. (Anon, n.d.) The towers also invariably appear at the end of streets commanding the internal axes that facilitated communications toward them. As a result, they were a constant visual presence in the city (fig. 58). Beyond their defensive character, fortifications, by their very nature, also functioned as effective policing structures by restricting population movement and providing expedient tax barriers at the gates. (Anon, n.d.) The towers, in essence, dominated the city, imposing a measure of population control, and forming a last line of defense if any enemy troops managed to overcome the walls. A few examples serve to highlight how fortifications also dominated the city. Aineias the Tactician, writing on how to survive a siege, repeatedly warned against the threat internal plotters posed and advised authorities to take measures to expel or appease them in the event of a siege. (Anon, n.d.) Control of the walls was so important and symbolic that the Roman army awarded a special corona muralis, or mural crown, as a distinction to the first individual to scale an enemy wall. (Anon, n.d.) A single episode amongst many in Livy's history of the Second Punic War should suffice to further elucidate the notion. He describes the citizens of Henna in Sicily demanding the keys of the town gates from the Roman soldiers occupying the walls since they considered themselves freemen allied to 445 De Caro,\"Lo sviluppo urbanistico di Pompei,\" 72 and 77-79. The recent excavation of Tower IX with its placement at a great oblique angle in the fortifications confirms this concern with tower placement. 446 I. Pinder, \"Constructing and Deconstructing Roman City Walls: The Role of Urban Enceintes as Physical and Symbolic Borders,\" 74. 447 See Aineias the Tactician Book 6, 11, and 14. See Aeneas and D. Whitehead, Aineias the Tactician : How to Survive Under Siege: A Historical Commentary, with Translation and Introduction, (London, 2001). 448 Aulus Gellius 5.6.16. Authorities awarded the \"mural\" crown to the man who first scaled the wall and forced his way into an enemy town. It was ornamented with representations of the battlements of a wall. Gellius, Aulus, and J. C. Rolfe, The Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius (London, 1927). Rome. The implication here is that the keys to the gates and therefore the fortifications symbolize the liberty or subjugation of the town. Whoever controlled the walls of the city therefore also controlled its inhabitants. With these considerations in mind it is evident that the new towers reflected a powerful dual internal and external projection of strength. (Anon, n.d.) Most scholars consider the layout of the towers uniform, largely basing their observations on the structurally similar Towers X, XI and XII. This is hardly surprising since this portion of the wall remained visible after its first excavation while others were re-buried over time. Curiously, Mazois combined the three north towers for his generic reconstruction but actually depicted the ruins of Tower VII, with much of its stucco still in place, as the most complete example. He noted a slight variation of the plan, but did not explain the left rear door of Tower VII directly opposing the right door on the other three, in essence changing the layout of the stairways connecting the floors. (Anon, n.d.) This circumstance remained unnoticed by all subsequent authors, including Overbeck and Mau, who used Mazois as their main source on the towers. Only Reinicke recognized a difference in the layout of the towers, but he limited himself to pointing out that Towers II and III are mirror images to X, XI, and XII. 451 More recently, the Corpus Topographicum Pompeianum, points out the discrepancies of Mazois' work, urging the reader not to take his plans as fully accurate. And it rightly points out Reinicke's faults in reversing the plan to an exact mirror image. 452 449 Livy, 24.37.2. 450 Mazois, Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1, plate XII fig. 4. Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 42 fig. 11, copy Mazois' plate. 451 R. Reinicke, \"Die Befestignungsturme von Pompeii.\" In Zeitschrift fur Bildende Kunst mit dem Beiblatt Kunst-Chronik und Kunstliteratur 7 (1896), 83. (Anon, n.d.) In fact as the CTP points out, the plans of the towers probably come from different structures and, although Mazois, claims to show the plan of Tower XII, it probably also derives from Tower X. In my opinion Mazois, rendered Tower VII as he also depicts names carved in the wall section between the tower The main problem with the towers is that an accurate survey and plan of each structure is still lacking. Curiously, scholars have never fully noted the differences in the layout of the buildings, and a full survey of each tower is sorely needed. It is not the chance to protect themselves behind the shield they held in their left arm. This postern does the opposite and perhaps purposefully functioned as a re-entry point for sortie parties who could protect their left flank when approaching the tower. (Anon, n.d.) The type also features a slight variation in the decorative scheme; whereas the other towers, with the exception of VII, all display raised voussoirs defining the postern vaults, the openings of group two are flush with the masonry. Group three includes Towers V, VI, and VII, where the access from the city side is on the left side and opens up directly onto the second floor; a staircase on the right leads down to the first-floor chamber (fig. 60). This type features the same corridor as group one winding behind the main chamber to the postern. The layout of the staircase heading down to the vaulted chamber, however, lowers the ceiling of the corridor and, as a result, cuts the arrow slit at its end in half, rendering it ineffective. The arrow slit seems almost decorative and put into place to give the tower the same external appearance as those in group one. Finally group four only includes Tower IX (fig. 10). The rear door opens in the middle of the back wall directly onto the ground floor and the ruins hold no trace of staircases, posterns, or windows. This version of the building, however, is a much later reconstruction and probably served as a storage area rather than a defensive structure. (Anon, n.d.) Despite the differences, the layouts of the various groups are essentially very similar, with variations in the positions of the rear doors, stair access, and placement of the posterns. The reasons for the differences are difficult to pinpoint, but most probably relate to the surrounding terrain and the outworks in front of them, which remain largely (Anon, n.d.) Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 44-45 comment on the lack of these posterns in the wall circuit at Pompeii, but Tower IV was buried at the time. See also Mau, Pompeii: Its Life and Art, 241. (Anon, n.d.) Etani, Pompeii: Report of the Excavation at Porta Capua, 1993-2005, 307-308. unknown. This seems especially the case, if we take into account that the types concentrate in specific areas of the circuit. The towers composing group one, for example, concentrate on the north side of the city, where the gently sloping terrain offers the easiest attack routes. Those in group two, with the exception of Tower VIII, are located on the low, steep lava ridge on the south side limiting the possibilities for direct attack, but still allowing defensive troops to mount sorties against the enemy. 455 Group three concentrates on the eastern side of the city, where the high and steep lava ridge likely diminished the necessity for short-range weapons on the lower floors. It is also possible that the divergent groups represent phased construction events, or the piecemeal replacement of earlier towers, but only future excavations can further elucidate this hypothesis. Despite the internal plan variations the towers all appeared equal from a distance. Their embellishments included a formulaic First-Style white decorative scheme featuring an elevated socle, imitation ashlar blocks, and a Doric frieze (figs. 36, 47, 61). This layout differs slightly from the traditional First-Style scheme featuring a socle, orthostates, and ashlars followed by a frieze. Originally some doubt existed about the coverage of the stucco on the towers. Some authors only recognized imitative ashlars on the tower flanks and smooth stucco on the façades, but the full recovery of Towers VIII and X ended the debate. 456 Anne Laidlaw describes the decorative remains in detail which need no repetition here. However, a few slight variations are evident. For example, the height of the socle on Tower VIII is slightly lower, suggesting perhaps a later (Anon, n.d.) The terrain in front of Tower VIII is largely unexcavated and entirely unknown. See Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 1-10. 456 W. Clark, Pompeii 1 (London, 1831), 69. Also Gell, Pompeiana, 96. remodeling or different workshop applying the stucco, but these details are only noticeable from up close. As discussed further below, (Anon, n.d.) Laidlaw correlates the application of the First Style on public buildings to a notion of pietas, or duty to the state. (Anon, n.d.) The specific use of the Doric order on the towers, however, may also represent an oblique allusion to Minerva. We have already noted the goddess as performing a protective role on the fortifications of the city. Vitruvius notes that the strong proportions of the Doric order in particular reflect the martial strength of Mars, Minerva, and Hercules. He specifically recommends the use of the style on temples dedicated to her. (Anon, n.d.) The presence of the Doric frieze on the towers may therefore also relate to Minerva's role as protectress of the fortifications and the city. This religious aspect also reflected the benevolence of those who financed the construction of the fortifications to protect the community and their relationship with the goddess. Beyond military and religious considerations, it is clear that both towers and gates received nonmilitary and purely aesthetic decorative ensembles as a reflection of the city they enclosed. The new white towers acted as landmarks in effect marking the city and its territory for many miles around. The decoration of the gates and the towers complemented each other, further highlighting the transition between town and country. As in the previous phases, the architecture of the fortifications finds resonance in the city creating a direct connection with the ambitions of its citizens. (Anon, n.d.) See p. 138 ff. 458 A. Laidlaw, The First Style in Pompeii: Painting and Architecture (Rome, 1985), 307-309. 459 Vitruvius I.2.5. After the end of the Second Punic War and the neutralization of Carthage, Pompeii tapped into the new Roman trade routes with the east. The city was still nominally independent from Rome and the Samnite elite controlled much of the export and centralized landownership. Slaves increasingly worked the land, producing a massive influx of population from the countryside into the city. (Guzzo, n.d.) This shift would eventually cause the stresses leading to the crisis of the Social War and the implantation of a Sullan colony in Pompeii. The city also participated in Rome's conquest of the east. Lucius Mummius, the great sacker of Corinth, dedicated a statue of Apollo in his Temple on the Forum in gratitude for Pompeian support in Roman eastern campaigns. (Anon, n.d.) The rich spoils of war, as with many other centers in Italy, swept Pompeii into the currents of feverish construction activity occurring on the peninsula. (Anon, 2008) Recently Fabrizio Pesando referred to the second century BCE as Pompeii's golden age when it developed the necessary architecture to call itself a city. (Pesando, 2004) toward the sea and the Monti Lattari. (Anon, n.d.) The complex towered some thirty meters above the riverine port below, dominating the landscape for miles around and forming a landmark for ships at sea. From a distance the tufa fortification wall essentially formed an enormous podium for the sanctuary, creating, as in the previous phases, a direct visual 464 Wallace-Hadrill, Rome's Cultural Revolution, 132, De Caro, \"La città sannitica, urbanistica e architettura,\" 23-46, P. Zanker Pompeii. Public and Private Life (Cambridge, 1998), 32-60. Carafa recently dates the colonnade around the Doric Temple to the post-earthquake period. See Carafa, \"Minervae et Marti et Herculi aedes doricae fient (Vitr. 1.2.5). The Monumental History of the Sanctuary in Pompeii's so-called Triangular Forum,\" 99. 465 See Coarelli, \"Il culto di Mefitis in Campania e a Roma,\" 187. 466 Curti, \"Il tempio di Venere Fisica e il porto di Pompei,\" 52-54. The report omits any further detail and without more evidence the dating remains hard to assess more accurately. The use of tufa is nevertheless curious considering the extensive remains of the limestone curtain in the nearby Porta Marina. connection between the walls, a protective goddess of the city, and one of Pompeii's most ambitious architectural projects. The development of the sanctuary, therefore, also acted as massive political statement. It implicitly legitimized the power of the Pompeian elite by emphasizing their relationship with the deities protecting the city, and their role as protectors of the community through the construction of the fortifications. The choice of using tufa in particular resonated with elite housing and the image of the city to further underscore the message. The construction materials used throughout Pompeii are the very same tufa and opus incertum employed on the city walls. Tufa is a relatively soft stone, easy to quarry and sculpt. Its compact character also allows it to be dressed to a uniform smoothness which is ideal for the application of stucco veneers imitating marble. These qualities led to its use as a building material from the late third century BCE up to the final days of the city. (Anon, n.d.) In this context the city walls very much formed a laboratory for tufa construction at Pompeii, since it is here that architects first used the material on a large scale. More versatile than limestone, tufa soon became a prestige material surpassed only by marble introduced during the Imperial period. In fact, builders used it primarily in highly visible places such as colonnades, stylobates, façades, and impluvium linings, for viewers to admire and patrons to flaunt. The exact quarries that fed the construction of the fortifications are still unknown, but miners extracted the stone from areas on the Sorrento peninsula, the Monti Lattari, and the neighboring town of Nocera, and transported it to town by ship, river barge, and carts. (Anon, n.d.) The diversity of the quarries used explains the brown to grey color range of the tufa employed throughout the city, but the fortifications tend to present a consistent grey/brown type indicating its origin from a common location. Opus incertum gained popularity in the middle of the second century BCE, and some of the less opulent houses used it for their façades and main building material. The hypothesis that the First-Style embodied pietas is certainly interesting, but it remains debatable since the notion seems to be more a code of conduct rather than an implicit ideal. (Anon, n.d.) However, the connection between the First-Style and its presence on the Pompeian fortifications merits further discussion. In particular the decorations on the exterior of the fortifications seem to connect to the aulic connotations of the style and project their part as a civic building protecting the settlement. It stressed their role in projecting a proper civic image, and legitimized the community they protected as a city. The Style, therefore, also correlated to the euergetism of the commissioners as leaders of 473 V.J. Bruno, \"Antecedents of the Pompeian First Style\" American Journal of Archaeology 73, no. 3 (July 1969): 305-308. 474 As suggested by S.T.A.M. Mols, \"Il Primo Stile 'retró': Dai propilei di Mnesicle a Pompei.\" In Omni pede stare. Saggi architettonici e circumvesuviani in memoriam Jos De Waele, edited by S.T.A.M. Mols and E.M. Moormann (Naples, 2005), 245. 475 For an extensive discussion see J.D. Garrison, Pietas from Vergil to Dryden (University Park, 1992), 9-21; P.G.W. Glare ed., Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford, 1996), 1378. society, and their role as protectors the community. The buildings and their embellishments contributed to legitimize the elite's power, and were a statement marking the independence of the city. Furthermore, its connections to sacred architecture suggests that the Doric order present on the towers may allude to Minerva as one of the city's protective deities. This complex interaction ensured that the First-Style on the fortifications also signified the relationship between the individual commissioners, the state, and the gods each providing their own contribution to the safety and well-being of the community. This interaction explains why the late-Republican magistrates dedicating city walls in Italy and the Roman West often did so as a symbolic act reflecting the (re-) foundation of the city, or its achievement of municipal or colonial status under Rome. (Anon, n.d.) As we shall see in the next chapter, the reconstruction of the Pompeian walls in the early colony is an example of this process. For these reasons fortifications eventually became the object of Imperial patronage under the Augustan program of civic renewal in Italy and the Roman west as a reflection of the new order. The process eventually culminated in the endowments of the great city gates of the Antonine age and thereafter at Attaleia, Timgad, and Bizya, to name a few examples. (Anon, n.d.) In this context they also symbolized the protection and benevolence of the emperor and the state toward the community, and its reciprocal allegiance with Rome. Beyond the connection between the First-Style and the city walls it is the tufa that created the strongest resonance between the fortifications and a distinct visual architectural image of the city. The rapid development of Pompeii included the large 476 E. Thomas, Monumentality and the Roman Empire: Architecture in the Antonine Age (Oxford, 2007), 108-113. (Anon, n.d.) Thomas, Monumentality and the Roman Empire: Architecture in the Antonine Age, 110-112. scale construction of houses that display similar, perhaps unambiguously designated, specifications. (Anon, n.d.) The most extensive use of tufa is therefore not in the monuments but rather in the private residences of elite citizens. The wealthiest families built on a lavish scale and scholars often view their dwellings, sometimes spanning the area of a full city block, as emulating the opulent Hellenistic palaces of the east. A concentration of these buildings exists in Regio VI, whereas others scattered through the city invariably face the main connecting arteries (fig. 63). (Anon, n.d.) Tufa blocks feature prominently on the façades of the most opulent houses and they immediately establish a dramatic visual presence in the city. (Anon, n.d.) In the earliest examples the tufa ashlars display rather sober carvings with plain rustication. They eventually gave way to more elaborate carved pilasters and canonically proportioned entablatures with carved Corinthian and Doric capitals framing the doorways. (Anon, n.d.) This development suggests an element of competition amongst the home owners vying to flaunt their wealth on the exterior of their houses. (Anon, n.d.) The implication is (Anon, n.d.) See R. Ling, Pompeii. History, Life and Afterlife (Stroud, 2005), 36-37. Ling refers to these as the Hoffmann houses, after their descriptor, due to their regularity. See Hoffmann, \"L'Architettura,\" 91 479 Zanker, Pompeii. Public and Private Life, 33. 480 The best preserved examples are: the House of the Faun (VI.12.2), House of Pansa, House of Sallust (VI.2.4), VI.1.16-18, House of the Large Fountain (VI.8.22), House of the Ancient Hunt (VII.4.48). VII.4.32. Most of the north side of VII.12 (via degli Augustali) and the southern façade of V.1 including the House of the Young Bull (V.1.7.) and the Domus Cornelia (VIII.4.23). The shops lining the west side of the via dei Teatri (VIII.5.31-35) perhaps dialogued with the propylon of the Triangular Forum. Almost the entirety of the via dell'Abbondanza heading west from the intersection of the via Stabiana with the exception of the north face of VIII.4, and the south face of VII.14 which both show signs of earthquake damage and were re-built at a later stage. In this stretch particularly handsome examples are the House of the Lime (VIII.5.28), and the southern side of insula VII.13. Also, VIII.3.10 where the adjacent surviving tufa pylons feature carved pilasters and doorway architrave perhaps prefiguring the later decorative scheme of the Eumachia building and the comitium. Finally, insula VII.6.20-28 including the House of the Peristyle. 481 Adam, \"Building Materials, Construction Techniques and Chronologies,\" 100. 482 For a recent discussion on the importance of the façade as part of the expression of wealth see J. Hartnett, \"Si quis hic sederit: Streetside Benches and Urban Society in Pompeii.\" American Journal of Archaeology 112, no. 1 (2008): 91-119. He particularly treats street benches as part of urban life, but also discusses the elements of private representation inherent on house façades. that the tufa facades similarly replicated the high quality masonry that the First Style also imitated, but applied to a local prestige material. Some scholars claim that the tufa façades carried a thin stucco veneer but, as in the case of the House of the Faun, this seems to be a colonial period phenomenon or even post-earthquake additions aimed at masking divergent repair masonry. (Anon, n.d.) A number of elements suggest that the façades were, by and large, left naked to emphasize the material. Chief amongst these are programmata, graffiti, and inscriptions, including the eituns, recovered on a number of the façades. We will discuss their significance further below, but we owe the very preservation of the eituns to the application of a stucco veneer that fell off the façades after excavation. (Anon, n.d.) In other instances, such as the House of Pansa (VI.6.1) and the House of the Little Fountain (VI.8.23), red programmata and graffiti still covered the tufa masonry at the time of the eruption suggesting a deliberate preservation of the façades. (Anon, n.d.) To some extent this circumstance may even reflect an element of façadism for the structures involved, but this particular aspect remains hard to (Anon, n.d.) Hoffmann describes a thin veneer of stucco on the façade on the House of the Faun and uses it as evidence to apply stucco to all the tufa facades in the city. A. Hoffmann, \"Elemente Bürgerlicher Repräsentation. Eine Späthellenistische Hausfassade in Pompeji.\" In Akten des 13 Internationalen Kongresses für Klassische Archäologie (Mainz, 1990), 491. On colonial stucco see A. Maiuri, \"Portali con capitelli cubici a Pompei.\" Rendiconti della accademia di archeologia, lettere e belle arti, 33 (1958), 210. 484 Pocetti ascribes their preservation to a stucco veneer that fell off after excavation. See P. Pocetti, \"Riflessi di strutture di fortificazioni nell'epigrafia italica tra Il II e I secolo a.C.\" Athenaeum 66 (1988), 321. Similarly Mau mentions the discovery of one the north side of VIII, 5, 19-20 after the plaster peeled off. See Mau, Pompeii: Its Life and Art, 240. Cooley more recently also shares this view. See A. Cooley and M. Cooley, Pompeii: A Sourcebook (London, 2004), 19. Sgobbo implicitly states that the first examples found and examined were actually placed on the naked tufa facades. See I. Sgobbo, \"Un complesso di edifici sannitici e i quartieri di Pompei per la prima volta riconosciuti.\" In Rendiconti accademia di archeologia lettere e belle arti di Napoli 6 (1942), 32. 485 For the House of Pansa, the right most pilaster also preserves an eituns inscription, while the pilaster next to doorway 19 features graffiti dating to the years leading up to the eruption announcing the rental of upper floors in the nearby insula of Arianna Poliana, see Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 175. See also M. Pagano and R. Priscindaro, I primi anni degli scavi di Ercolano, Pompei e Stabiae: Raccolta e studio di documenti e disegni inediti vol.2 (Castellammare di Stabia, 2006), 111. Finally Fiorelli mentions an electoral dipinto on the tufa of the pilaster next to entrance 19 reading P. Cipio, Fiorelli, Descrizione di Pompeii, 104. For the House of the Little Fountain see A. Varone and G. Stefani Titulorum Pictorum Pompeianorum (Rome,2009), 320. prove and needs further investigation in another venue. (Anon, n.d.) In any event, many patrons considered tufa an aesthetically acceptable material, especially in the more well-to-do households. The very expense incurred to build and carve the tufa probably led the owner to want it uncovered. This recognition lasted much further into the history of the city since many tombs outside of the Porta Nocera feature graffiti on the tufa, attesting to the absence of stucco on the masonry. Similarly the great tufa columns in the peristyle of the House of Pansa were only stuccoed over during the Imperial period, having been left naked since the time of its construction. (Anon, n.d.) Tufa therefore superseded the application of stucco on the facades of the most elite houses most likely because of a limited availability of marble, and the relative lesser intrinsic value of opus incertum. The result was a local civic image that married tufa as a prestige material with the concepts associated to proper civic representation associated with the First Style. The extensive remains of tufa façades throughout the city actually push the concept of a unified civic image further. The via dell'Abbondanza particularly illustrates the point (fig. 64). Its western tract, running between the via Stabiana and the Forum, originally featured a coherent lining of tufa façades on both public and private buildings. (Anon, n.d.) A tufa gateway on the east side of the Forum announced the beginning of the road. Both Nissen and Wallace-Hadrill suggest that the unified architectural appearance functioned as a purposeful ceremonial background for religious processions between the Forum and the Doric Temple. (Anon, n.d.) More importantly, the layout reflects a conscious shaping of the architectural image of the city. It seems reasonable to assume (Anon, n.d.) As suggested in a private conversation with Prof. Clarke. See also the discussion further below concerning the application of the First-Style on the exterior of buildings. (Anon, n.d.) Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 175. (Anon, n.d.) The earthquake demolished much of the original masonry but enough remains, including the Stabian baths, to imagine the stateliness of the road. (Anon, n.d.) Wallace-Hadrill, Rome's Cultural Revolution, 133. that this vision also translated to the city walls as the largest structure in the urban framework. Further examples line the via di Nola and the via degli Augustali to the north, suggesting that the idea of a civic image permeated further throughout the city. Also striking is the survival of these façades for the remainder of Pompeian history, despite extensive remodeling occurring inside the houses. The representational element is clear, and the exterior of the house also functioned as a statement promoting the owner's status. (Anon, n.d.) Interestingly the construction of tufa façades ceased abruptly after the Sullan conquest,foot_128 and many of these houses remained the property of the old Samnite elite, suggesting the continuity of a strong local identity beyond the subsequent installation of the Roman colony. Strikingly, in a similar fashion to the city walls, the façades sometimes rest on limestone foundations that occasionally still peek through the raised sidewalks. (Anon, n.d.) This circumstance is likely the result of the Vitruvian prescription noting the qualities of travertine as a foundation stone. It suggests that the limestone/tufa combination is actually a standard construction technique used throughout Pompeii. This observation argues in favor of two important points; it strengthens the case that the appearance of the fortifications is the result of the application of standard construction technique, and that the outer curtain is actually the result of a single construction event. We have already commented on the continued uncertainty concerning the construction phasing of the walls. Furthermore, without further excavations it remains unclear to what extent the limestone was visible on the house façades. But the use of the limestone/tufa technique on the fortifications is, in my opinion, so marked and exaggerated that it clearly also carried an intended aesthetic effect regardless of the individual phases assigned in the past. It essentially marked a strong local identity that reflected the ambitions of the community and the elite to define Pompeii as a proper city. The surviving inscriptions of the golden age tell us that the construction of public buildings occurred at the hands of private individuals belonging to a few very select and powerful families. We have already seen how Vibius Popidius, as the meddix tuticus, or magistrate, at Pompeii highlighted his euergetism on the Porta Nola and the colonnade on the south side of the Forum. (Anon, n.d.) Other inscriptions also found on or near the walls stressed similar benefactions to the city. The excavations of Tower VIII recovered fragments of a monumental inscription in the Oscan alphabet, the letters: They were carved into the stucco and painted black. (Anon, n.d.) The surviving fragments have occasioned a number of interpretations including that they belonged to a dedicatory inscription, that they spelled out the Oscan word svddit, or tower, also mentioned in the eituns, or that they simply marked the tower with the numeral VIII. (Anon, n.d.) Two more inscriptions appear at the Porta Stabia. One, written entirely in Oscan, sits along the western passageway wall facing those that leave the city. It reads: .siuttiis m, n půntiis m | aidilis ekak viam terem[na| a] tens. ant půnttram staf(i)anam viu (Anon, n.d.) The meddix tuticus was one of a few magistrates exercising power at Pompeii. See below for a further discussion. (Anon, n.d.) First published by Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 30. (Anon, n.d.)

Sgobbo, \"Un complesso di edifici sannitici e i quartieri di Pompei per la prima volta riconosciuti,\" Rendiconti accademia di archeologia lettere e belle arti di Napoli 6 (1942), 20 who uses it to further define Pompeian topography.

Spudius Firmus repaved the road from the gate to the station of the cisarii, the drivers of the cissium, a light two wheeled cart, at the limits of Pompeian territory at their own expense. (Anon, n.d.) The inscriptions are part of a wider group announcing the euergetism of private individuals throughout the city, but their presence here stresses the role of the gates as the conceptual beginning and end points of the urban matrix. Although written in Oscan, they are part of a Latin tradition suggesting that Pompeii is part of the wider cultural development of the Italian peninsula. Their position on the exterior of the towers particularly highlights the notion that the walls were meant to be seen from outside the city and they essentially announced its civic and social organization. (Anon, n.d.) In essence, they were the stage announcing the independence and political identity of the city. (Anon, n.d.) As Isobel Pinder recently pointed out, the walls provided the conceptual setup for the postmurum, or the city beyond the wall, by implementing a structured entrance and exit to a hierarchy of public monuments and private dwellings. (Anon, n.d.) As a result, they also reflected the ambitions and power of the elite that financed their construction. At Pompeii the clear association between the walls and the city resonated through its construction materials and decorative schemes. It seems clear that the patrons financing the walls 498 CIL X 1064 (Anon, n.d.) Mau, Pompeii: Its Life and Art, 243. (Anon, n.d.)

Pinder, \"Constructing and Deconstructing Roman City Walls: The Role of Urban Enceintes as Physical and Symbolic Borders,\" 72-74. further emphasized this message as part of their own legitimization of power. The fortifications explicitly connected further with the ambitions of the local elite through the appearance of the walls and the façades of their houses. As a result, the walls not only announced and conceptually visualized the city; they also reflected the independence, social hierarchy, wealth, and status of a fully developed urban matrix. With such strong architectural associations between the city and its walls, we return to the eituns inscriptions as valuable documents highlighting the relationship between the populace and the fortifications. Over the years the inscriptions have attracted much scholarly attention, and this is not the place to reinterpret or retranslate them. (Anon, 1992) As mentioned above, the most commonly accepted interpretation is that they represent directions for Samnite troops sent to aid Pompeii during the Sullan siege. They get their name from the recurrent word eituns which loosely translates to milites or \"foot soldiers\" in Oscan. (Antonini, 1898) The inscriptions contain some crucial bits of information; they implicitly mention tower numbers and gate names. Two inscriptions found on the façades of VI.2.1 and VI.6.3 direct toward Tower XII and the veru sarinu, or salt gate, as a sector commanded by Maras Adirius. (Curran, 1953) A third inscription, located on the House of the Faun (VI.12.1), points the way to Towers X and XI as a sector under the command of Titus This basic evidence suggests a series of wider elements at work. First and foremost, the counterclockwise numbering of the towers and division in sectors clearly indicates a strict military planning and organization. Pocetti assigns much more significance to this sequence that suggests a Roman influence on the organization of the defenses. The numbering started with Tower I at the tip of the Triangular Forum, where it also was one of the most visually defining buildings of the cityscape. The number of the building reflects its status as a landmark contributing to create a visual concept of the city. The counterclockwise numbering perhaps also alluded to a religious association as processions often proceeded in the same direction. (Anon, n.d.) This context connects the numbers to the direction of lustratio, or purification ceremonies, associated in this case with the act of tracing the sulcus primigenius at the founding of the city. (Anon, n.d.) It may also represent the annual lustratio urbis designed to purify the city and keep away evil spirits. The town (Anon, n.d.) Vetter 26. (Anon, n.d.)

Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 116. of Iguvium, modern Gubbio, preserves instructions for the ritual where priests led a procession around the arx and conducted a sacrifice at each of the three gates since these were the weak spots in the circuit. (Anon, n.d.) If we take these ideas to their next logical step they might explain why the religious elements of the Porta Stabia, Porta Vesuvio, and Porta Marina are all on the right. Here they further emphasized the counterclockwise direction as one approached the city. Another key is that we catch a glimpse of the nomenclature with the names of the salt (sarinu) and urublanu gates, and a nickname mefira, loosely translated as \"midway,\" connected to a tower. Originally identified with Tower VIII, new evidence now assigns the mefira name to Tower VII because of its placement at the median between the Porta Sarno and Nola. (Anon, n.d.) More importantly, this nickname highlights how the towers acted as familiar landmarks and a focus for navigation through the city. (Anon, n.d.) If we consider, as Chiaramonte Trerè suggests, that the original text of the inscription on Tower VIII and the eituns reflected their official number or name, then the towers carried both popular and official names. (Anon, n.d.) Both references correlate closely to the function of the towers; the official number or name refers to the civic and military definition of the building, whereas the other reflects their role as easily identifiable landmarks in the urban matrix. 512 W. Fowler, \"Lustratio.\" In Anthropology and the Classics (New York, 1966), 183. (Anon, n.d.) Traditionally, Tower VIII has received the ancient nickname mefira, because of its location half-way between the so-called Porta Capua and the Porta Nola. See Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 26. After the recent excavation of Tower IX disproved the existence of the Porta Capua, Coarelli reassigned the mefira nickname to Tower VII. This is the tower half way between the Porta Sarno and the Porta Nola, at the end of a street he identifies as the via mefira. He posits that this road is the continuation of the via degli Augustali which is the mid-way road between the via dell'Abbondanza and the via di Nola. Coarelli, \"Pompei. Il Foro, le elezioni, le circoscrizioni elettorali,\" 106. (Anon, n.d.) Pocetti, \"Riflessi di strutture di fortificazioni nell'epigrafia italica tra il II e I secolo a.C,\" 324. This is entirely consistent with how people used landmarks to navigate the city, see R. Ling, \"A Stranger in Town: Finding the Way in an Ancient City.\" Greece and Rome 37 (1990): 204-214, especially regarding Pompeii. On how landmarks and identity work in neighborhoods and especially Pompeii see R. Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society (New York, 2007), 34-45. 515 Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 30. With the gates the situation is slightly different since we do not fully understand whether the nomenclature is official or represents nicknames. The Porta Ercolano seems securely identified as the Salt Gate, or the veru sarinu, because the via Consolare passing through it probably led to a series of salt flats nearby. 516 We also have the name of the veru urublanu, identified variously as the Porta Nola, 517 Porta Sarno, 518 or the Porta Nocera. 519 This diversity of hypotheses is part of an intense debate on the gate names closely related to the eituns, the electoral programmata, and the identification of population groups associated with Pompeii. Scholars have identified a multitude of group names: the salinienses, urbulanenses, campanienses, forenses, dianenses, and the stabianenses, who either inhabited nearby settlements and territories known as pagi, 520 or lived inside the city where they occupied distinct neighborhoods or vici. 521 The individual gates then received these names according to the pagi their roads led to, or their neighboring vici. Another hypothesis argues that the gates actually named the vici, whereas the inhabitants of both the neighboring pagi and vici they connected composed 516 Originally Ribezzo identified the Porta Sarno with the veru sarinu. See F. Ribezzo, \"La nuova eituns di Pompei.\" Rivista indo-greco-italica di filologia, lingua, antichità 1 (1917), 58. For the arguments identifying the veru sarinu with the Porta Ercolano, see Sogliano, \"Porte, torri e vie di Pompei nell'epoca Sannitica,\" 162-164. 517 Sogliano, \"Porte, torri e vie di Pompei nell'epoca Sannitica,\" 168. More recently see Coarelli, \"Pompei. Il Foro, le elezioni, le circoscrizioni elettorali,\"107. See also Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 33. 518 M.

Spano \"Porte e regioni pompeiane e vie campane.\" Rendiconti dell'accademia di archeologia, lettere e belle arti, Napoli 17 (1937), 276. 519 Sakai, \"Ve28 reconsidered,\" 9. 520 Ribezzo, for example, floated the idea that the urbulanenses came from the town of Urbula. He used ancient texts to argue that they abandoned it to settle in a pagus outside of Pompeii. The road to the pagus then gave the name to the gate. See Ribezzo, \"La nuova eituns di Pompei,\" 55-63. More recently Pesando suggests that veru urublanu translates to 'gate to the urbs', the urbs and gate in this case being Pompeii and the Porta Nola. See also Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 33. 521 See G. Amodio, \"Sui 'vici' e le circoscrizioni elettorali di Pompei.\" Athenaeum 84 (1996), 458-468. She revisits much of the scholarly controversy and suggests that the electoral colleges included both vici and pagi united in tribus. the electoral groups. (Anon, n.d.) All of these hypotheses rest on shaky grounds. (Anon, n.d.) The pagi thesis, widely accepted in early scholarship, relies on a still uncertain regional topography. The vici theory, elaborated by Sgobbo, builds on Della Corte's controversial idea of correlating the electoral programmata on house exteriors with their owners. (Anon, n.d.) The vici thesis has received widespread acceptance. The most recent approach identifies five tribes responding to independent electoral colleges in Pompeii: the urbulanenses in Regio III and IX, the campanienses in Regio IV and V, the salinienses in Regio VI, and the forenses in the area around the Forum (fig. 65). The fifth remains unnamed, but probably occupied the area of Regio I and II. In this framework the gates acquire the following names; the Porta Nola as the veru urublanu (porta urbulana in Latin), Porta Vesuvio as porta campana, Porta Ercolano as veru sarinu (salienses in Latin) and the Porta Marina as the porta forensis. (Anon, n.d.) Most of these names are originally Oscan and carried through into Latin, suggesting a remarkable continuity in the political organization of the city despite the implantation of the colony. Regardless of the true nomenclature, the notion of naming gates according to the neighboring vici or pagi, or vice versa, suggests an intergroup identification with their respective structures. The question then naturally follows whether the city gates carried (Anon, n.d.) Castrén, Ordo populusque Pompeianus, 80-82. (Anon, n.d.) Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society 34-35. 524 M. Della Corte, Case ed abitanti a Pompei ricerche di epigrafia (Naples 1914), 165. Sgobbo mapped the electoral notices set up by groups supporting individual candidates and assigned them to quarters in the city according to their concentrations. Sgobbo, \"Un complesso di edifici sannitici e i quartieri di Pompei per la prima volta riconosciuti\" 34. Both Eschebach and Amodio brilliantly summarize the further vicissitudes of the debate so we need not revise them here. Amodio in particular delivers a sharp critique of Della Corte's methods. See Amodio, \"Sui 'vici' e le circoscrizioni elettorali di Pompei.\" 458-468. See also Eschebach and Eschebach, Pompeji vom 7. Jahrhundert v.Chr. bis 79 n.Chr 65-67, and more recently Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society, 34-39 who actually prefers to use the distribution of fountains to recognize neighborhoods. (Anon, n.d.) Coarelli further elaborates Sgobbo's thesis using the compital altars located on the main roads to mark the borders of the vici. He sees the division of Pompeii into five electoral regions, which relates to its name Oscan name 'pentapolis' or city of five. Coarelli, \"Pompei. Il Foro, le elezioni, le circoscrizioni elettorali,\" 97. any individual traits highlighting these relationships. The present evidence does not immediately point to any embellishments explicitly stressing such connections. Rather, if we take away the minor exceptions of the Porta Stabia and Ercolano, the gates show a remarkable diachronic unity in design, decoration, and layout, as do the towers. In many ways, therefore, the fortifications acted as a unifying architectural force encompassing the social plurality of Pompeii. The follow-up question is whether this is a reflection of a local Pompeian identity or a foreign influence-or both. We pumpeianus. (Anon, n.d.) The most recent re-evaluation demystifies the idea as well as the power of the league and characterizes the meddices as strong independent local magistrates 526 De Caro points to the meddix tuticus as exercising power in the name of the Nucerian League, and is unsure of the role of the meddix pumpeianus who appears in inscriptions. He also mentions the presence of two aediles and a quaestor probably functioning on Roman models. Finally there was also a Senate, the kunparakin, and an assembly of free male citizens known as the kumbenni. See De Caro,\"La città sannitica urbanistica e architettura,\" 32. This setup aligns with the early Samnite political organization where individual settlements, known as vici, were grouped into a regional pagus, or canton. Each pagus elected a meddix as a leader who in turn responded to the meddix tuticus. He headed a grouping of pagi organized along familial and tribal lines, known as touta. See Cornell, \"Warfare and Urbanization in Roman Italy,\" 124. responding to a very loose and weak federal league. 527 The debate here is important to us since the politics of a league of cities may have influenced the design and construction of fortifications. Loose alliances, such as the Etruscan dodecapoli, ensured a degree of mutual security against external threats. The agreements reached could involve the siting of settlements, warning systems, the construction of common fortification works, and mutual non-aggression pacts. Furthermore, a central political body could also manage the resources necessary to coordinate the simultaneous defense of several settlements, or conduct offensive operations. 528 Within our framework, the most important points of contact between Nocera and Pompeii come through in the astonishing similarities between their fortifications. The layout of Nocera is rectangular with heavy natural scarps defending the north, west, and eastern sides of the city. The southern side, as the most vulnerable section, received the heaviest fortifications and like Pompeii featured a tufa opus quadratum double wall with an agger in the back. Beyond our two centers, this design was fairly common throughout the region and displays strong similarities with other settlements such as Teano, Monte Santa Croce, and Saepinum. 529 This circumstance may be the result of a strong Samnite military tradition, or a widespread adoption of the most effective defensive architecture. At Nocera the defenses proved formidable enough that Hannibal reduced the city by starvation rather than direct attack and subsequently destroyed it in 216 BCE. 530 527 F. Senatore, \"La lega nucerina.\" In Pompei tra Sorrento e Sarno. Atti del terzo e quarto ciclo di conferenze di Geologia, Storia e Archeologia (Rome, 2001), 185-265. Carafa actually sees the league dissolved in 304 BCE at the end of the Second Samnite War but he remains unclear how magistrates continued to exercise power. Carafa, \"Minervae et Marti et Herculi aedes doricae fient (Vitr. 1.2.5). The Monumental History of the Sanctuary in Pompeii's so-called Triangular Forum,\" 93. 528 Rowlands, \"Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements,\" 452. Also Lawrence Greek Aims in Fortification, 123. 529 Conta Haller designates it as type A''. See G. Conta Haller, Ricerche su alcuni centri fortificati in opera poligonale in area Campano-Sannitica (Naples, 1978),78. 530 Johannowsky, \"Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina,\" 123. After the war Nocera rebuilt and strengthened its defenses with the addition of towers in opus incertum. The use of tufa and opus incertum, local construction materials to both Pompeii and Nocera, is hardly surprising as these were cheap and easily available. Given the similarities, it seems plausible to assume a common origin for the design and decoration of the structures at Pompeii and Nocera. Furthermore, the matching acroteria of the Basilica in Pompeii and the towers at Nocera may even reflect close political ties between the two settlements. 533 531 Johannowsky, \"Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina,\" 123. Johannowsky points to two construction phases at Nocera. The last occurred shortly before or contemporaneously to Pompeii. His dating however rests on typological differences which, as at Pompeii, may respond to the local terrain. This is not the place to dive further into this complex issue, but a distinct possibility exists that all towers in both cities are built in the space of just a few years. 532 W. Johannowsky, \"Nuovi rinvenimenti a Nuceria Alfaterna.\" In La regione sotterrata dal Vesuvio. Studi e prospettive. Atti del convegno internazionale, 11-15 Novembre 1979 (Naples, 1982), 842. See also Johannowsky \"Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina,\"123-131. 533 In particular, scholars traditionally date the construction of the Basilica to the last decades of the second century bce, making it roughly contemporary with the towers. As a building form this is a typically Roman edifice. Its presence in the city points to a strong Roman component to Pompeii. see Zanker \"The City as The origins of the basic design and layout are more difficult to trace since the mechanisms of martial architectural transmission have not received much scholarly attention. Richardson proposes that the limestone and tufa enceintes at Pompeii are the product of a single design modeled on the Athenian walls of the fourth century BCE, but there is little further evidence to support this theory. 534 The Servian Wall in Rome is an example of the complexity of the issue. Built using tufa opus quadratum in the first quarter of the fourth century BCE, engineers exploited the natural topography and built an agger in the weak areas to maximize the wall's strength. In concept, therefore, the fortifications in Rome foreshadowed the Pompeian design. In the early 1930s Gӧsta Säflund conducted an intensive study of the remains. Based on the similarity of quarry marks and block sizes, he concluded that the Servian Wall borrowed heavily from Syracusan architects and construction techniques. 535 In fact, a recent investigation on the section of walls preserved near the modern Termini railway station in Rome reveals construction seams roughly a plethorn measure apart indicating a similar organization of construction crews mentioned by Diodorus Siculus for the Epiploae fortifications. 536 The two cities shared Carthage as an enemy, a circumstance, Säflund believed, that led to their close collaboration as allies. Dionysius I of Syracuse was a pioneer in the use of siege machines in the Hellenistic world. He likely learned how to build them from his encounters with Carthaginians armies who had been exposed to advanced siege tactics in Symbol: Rome and the Creation of an Urban Image,\" 126-40; more specifically for Pompeii see Zanker Pompeii. Public and Private Life, 61-78 534 Richardson, Pompeii: An Architectural History, 49. 535 G. Säflund, Le mura di Roma repubblicana: Saggio di archeologia romana (Uppsala (Anon, n.d.) In this case the plethron measurement was thirty-six meters. Other striking similarities reside in the employment of the Achaean Greek alphabet for the quarry marks and the use of the two attic feet in the measurement of the blocks. Furthermore, the crews probably used Greek construction technology such as polipastos beams and were also recruited from the very poor of the city. Perge. (Anon, n.d.) Incidentally, the round towers flanking the Hellenistic South Gate at Perge also carried a decorative Doric frieze and pilasters carved in low relief. (Anon, n.d.) The presence of a roof on towers, however, is more a matter of practicality since they primarily functioned as fortified firing platforms for catapults and ballistae. (Anon, n.d.) A roof was therefore almost a prerequisite to shelter the delicate machines and their crews from the elements and enemy 537 Säflund, Le mura di Roma repubblicana: Saggio di archeologia romana, 115-118, 170-174 538 For the quarry marks see FitzGerald, Facts about Pompei, 62-86, Sogliano, \"Relazione degli scavi fatti nel febbraio 1898,\" 64-65, and Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 280. Curiously, Bonucci believes that the inscribed characters were there not only for construction purposes, but also served an apotropaic function. This theory, however, has not received any further attention. See C. Bonucci, Pompéi (Naples, 1830), 81-82. 539 See F. Frigerio, La cerchia di Novum Comum. Antiche porte di città italiche e romane (Como, 1935), fig. 11. See also Adam, L'Architecture militaire Grecque, 39. 540 See A. Lawrence and R. Tomlinson, Greek Architecture (New Haven, 1996), 176. They represent the latest in fortification design, presenting a stronger unified façade to the enemy, and facilitating repairs as opposed to earlier pyramidal roofs. Also, Johannowsky \"Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina,\" 132. 541 Winter Greek Fortifications, 88 542 Lawrence and Tomlinson, Greek Architecture 174. for the defending troops, and catapult balls, allegedly belonging to the siege, adorned the gardens of Pompeii at the time of their excavation. (Jashemski & Meyer, 1925) The event clearly lingered in Pompeian memory as a marker, positive or negative, of the changes that occurred shortly thereafter. The damage wrought upon the city remains difficult to quantify, but the Roman army spared it the fate of the neighboring rebel city of Stabia, which was completely flattened as punishment for its affiliation with the revolt. (Jones & Robinson, 2005) Instead, Roman authorities transformed Pompeii into a colony, renaming it Colonia Cornelia Veneria Pompeianorum in 80 BCE. (Anon, n.d.) The title carried multiple personal meanings to Sulla; cornelia referred to his nephew and co-founder of the colony P. Cornelius Sulla, and referenced the Sullan gens Cornelia. Veneria alluded to Venus as the personal protective goddess of the dictator. (Descoeudres, 2007) As discussed further below, the new status of the city included an influx of Roman veterans and their families as colonists, leading to decisive social changes and the new identity of Pompeii. Nevertheless, a large portion of the city also remained Samnite, dividing broadly into the pro-and anti-Roman camps that had shaped the previous period and had battled each other in the Social War. (Anon, n.d.) This surviving population led to a measure of continuity that blurs any neat distinction the date 80 BCE invites modern scholars to establish. The immediate effects of the Roman victory are murky; scholars identify an interim period of uncertain rule between the battle and the installation of the colony. (Anon, n.d.) Soon afterward the duumviri T. Cuspius and M. Loreius restored the walls (fig. 68). The most recent hypothesis identifies the revolt of Spartacus around 70 BCE as a major catalyst for the reconstruction, but, as emphasized below, Roman notions correlating city walls with the proper image of a colony likely also played a part. (Anon, n.d.) The inscription celebrating their accomplishment mentions that the work concentrated on the murum and plumam, it reads: 555 CVSPIVS • T • F • M • LOREIV(s) M • F DVOVIR (d) D S MVRVM ET 552 Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 118-119 553 Lo Cascio,\"La società pompeiana dalla città sannitica alla colonia romana,\" 123. 554 As mentioned previously scholars first associated the renovation with the unrest resulting from Caesar's death. See Fiorelli Gli scavi di Pompei dal 1861 Al 1872, 89 and also Nissen Pompeianische Studien 511. Since then a new theory associates the date with the revolt of Spartacus. See Castrén Ordo Populusque Pompeianus, 88. F. Zevi, \"Pompei dalla città sannitica alla colonia sillana: per un'interpretazione dei dati archeologici.\" In Les èlites municipales de l'Italie péninsulaire des Gracques à Néron (Rome, 1996), 129. Also Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 30 and most recently Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 118. 555 CIL X 937. The term murum clearly refers to walls, but the translation of the inscription is still controversial since the term plumam, or plumes, as related to fortifications remains uncertain and may refer to the battlements. The extent of the renovations is therefore difficult to assess. (Anon, n.d.) As mentioned previously, whether by full demolition or the removal of battlements, the demilitarization of city walls was a common punishment to prohibit their effective re-use, prevent renewed uprisings, and dismiss any form of civic independence or bargaining power. 557 Such measures are not immediately evident for Pompeii, although, as we have seen, a recent tenuous theory points out that the presence of drainage spouts in the opus incertum is the result of the reorganization of the battlements. (Anon, n.d.) A further complicating factor is the obscurity of the happenings throughout the siege. Only rams and mining operations could effectively bring down large sections of curtain wall and the use of these weapons at Pompeii remains uncertain. As in the previous chapter, I will assume that the opus incertum tracts surviving in the city walls largely represent post-siege repairs related to the battle and its immediate aftermath. I base this assumption primarily on the location of these tracts in the most vulnerable areas of the enceinte, their association with large construction projects such as the amphitheater, and some of the most recent masonry analyses and excavations. (Anon, n.d.) The following section offers a brief review of their appearance and, more broadly, the (Anon, n.d.) Nissen, Pompeianische Studien, 511. (Anon, n.d.) Rowlands, \"Defense: A Factor in the Organisation of Settlements,\" 448. See also (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) In particular Russo and Russo, whereas Hori is somewhat more reserved seeing their presence as generally typical of all opus incertum tracts. Russo and Russo, 89 a.C.: Assedio a Pompei 71-75, and Hori, \"Pompeian Town Walls and Opus Quadratum,\" 286. (Anon, n.d.) See the discussion on p. 113-114 interventions on the fortifications between the installation of the colony and the eruption of Vesuvius. The primary evidence is again difficult to analyze as much of the surviving masonry is completely bare, although some sort of stucco coating usually accompanied the application of opus incertum. Furthermore, the parapet has also largely disappeared, complicating the interpretation of the appearance of the walls. Two sections of opus incertum stretch on either side of the Porta Stabia (fig. 69). West of the entrance a tract of opus incertum masonry quickly gives way to an entirely demolished area of the defenses likely looted in the post-earthquake period. To the east, the relic of an earlier internal Sarno limestone pier interrupts an otherwise uniform sixty-meter stretch of opus incertum masonry. The pier corresponds to a slight reentrant in the curtain and the eastern enclosure wall of the schola Tomb of Marcus Tullius. (Anon, n.d.) The masonry adjacent to the gate is slightly rougher and it may represent a refurbishment or a partial demolition of the wall face carried out with the tomb construction. (Anon, n.d.) At its very bottom the wall displays a well finished surface that likely accommodated a now lost stucco veneer. East of the pier the masonry includes clear horizontal construction seams marking the sequential deposition of the concrete during the construction process. The parapet has completely disappeared, including any spouts that drained rainwater from the wall-walk. 562 560 As a prominent member of society, Marcus Tullius was probably responsible for the construction of the Temple of Fortuna Augusta. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) The rough state of the wall facing may however also relate to surface sections collapsing from the opus incertum masonry as very recently occurred at the Porta Nola. (Anon, n.d.) As noted previously, the only example recovered from the area is a spout carved in a lion's head spout but its periodization is unclear. The next large section of opus incertum supports the southern side of the amphitheater between Towers IV and V (fig. 70). Maiuri believed it was pre-Sullan and identified some early Imperial repairs to strengthen the wall against the agger behind it. (Anon, n.d.) Today modern imitation masonry composes much of the stretch and only the last ten meters leading up to Tower V are partially original. (Anon, n.d.) They display the remains of a plaster base coat that suggest a now lost embellishment. A couple of images from Maiuri's excavations around the amphitheater in the late 1950s confirm this layout. They show a low wall before its reconstruction and the ancient masonry is clearly visible next to the tower. Although Maiuri believed otherwise, the surviving ancient opus incertum masonry most likely relates to the construction of the amphitheater, but the current evidence does not allow any further elaboration on the matter. Only two known large tracts of opus incertum survive between the amphitheater and the Porta Vesuvio. The eastern bastion of the Porta Nola is perhaps one of the most imposing stretches. It still towers above anyone passing through the gate (fig. 71). A subsequent lowering of the road in the Augustan period, carried out to ease access into the city, revealed its foundations and added to the formidable impression of the gate. (Anon, n.d.) Scant remains of a stucco base coat survive, but too little remains for any further assessment. (Anon, n.d.) Further west recent excavations have re-exposed a section of opus incertum associated with Tower IX (fig. 10). The results confirm its post-colonial date and project its original height to some six meters, of which only some three remain. (Anon, n.d.) Interestingly, four counterforts rather than an agger strengthened the wall. Upon (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Muro della fortificazione,\" 233. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Pompei.

(Anon, n.d.) Three large sections of opus incertum masonry survive between the Porta Vesuvio and Ercolano (fig. 39). None display traces of a decorative scheme, but they do present a more intact parapet. A small section stretching twenty-five meters east from Tower XI features seven regularly spaced drainage spouts and a unique decorative masonry architrave supporting a continuous battlement. A smaller ten-meter patch of masonry also survives roughly twenty-two meters from Tower XI but it is less well preserved. To the west, an extensive section of masonry starts some fifteen meters east of Tower XII and covers most of the ground toward Porta Ercolano (fig. 72). Limestone blocks compose the parapet east of the tower and tufa spouts sit lower down encased in the masonry. (Anon, n.d.) West of the tower the parapet transitions into a series of vertical tufa blocks standing on a horizontal architrave. Below it nineteen regularly spaced drainage spouts survive set into the masonry. A vertical seam in the wall façade further marks the transition, and it may represent successive construction events or the work of differing construction crews. (Anon, n.d.) The wall face displays clear horizontal construction seams recently dated to the Roman colony. They are strikingly similar to those found east of the Porta Stabia. Patches of rubble fill throughout the section point to secondary emergency repairs that most likely date to the post-earthquake period. (Anon, n.d.)

(Anon, 2008) Further stretches of masonry survive on the western side of the city. The first creates a terrace for the vicolo dei Soprastanti and is incorporated into the later expansion of the House of Umbricus Scaurus (VII.16.15) (fig. 21). Its southern edge displays the same spouts and tufa parapet as the curtain east of the Porta Ercolano. A large patch of fired brickwork at its base suggests similar post-earthquake repairs. A recent hypothesis posits that a colonist acquired the house immediately after the installation of the colony. The new owner demolished the previous limestone curtain and substituted it with the current opus incertum wall as part of an effort to build rooms on the new lower terrace. (Pesando & Ercole, 2006) Perhaps as an implicit statement of conquest, or as a cost saving measure, he reused much of the limestone masonry as a building material for the refurbishments in the house. (Anon, n.d.) South of the Porta Marina opus incertum superimposed on a few older Sarno limestone courses acts as a terrace for the Temple of Venus (fig. 22). A lonely block of tufa suggests that it replaced an earlier limestone/tufa curtain. The so-called Villa Imperiale (VIII.1.a) enveloped this section of the fortifications in the late first century BCE, covering them with Third-Style frescos and burying the external pomerial road. (Pappalardo, 2005) East of the temple another large section of fortifications emerges from remains of later buildings (fig. 73). It includes encased drainage spouts and the remains of a tufa parapet similar to the wall east of the Porta Ercolano. The section displays signs of later re-use; the tufa blocks are sheared off and modified to support floor beams, and a terracotta sewer cut into the masonry at a later date drained excess water from the gardens above. Smooth white plaster and a surviving patch of embedded amphora pieces that likely functioned as a foundation for a stucco veneer still cover the masonry. It is unclear whether they are part of the original wall decoration or later buildings. (Anon, n.d.) Finally, a stretch of opus incertum, perhaps related to the construction of the yet unlocated Tower I, partially replaces the limestone terrace of the Doric Temple, but no parapet or drainage system survives. With a few exceptions, the reconstruction effort largely preserved the layout of the battlements and agger system of the fortifications. The presence of drainage spouts in the opus incertum is a case in point since they probably are re-used elements of the tufa curtain. Along with the tufa parapet and the consistent horizontal seams, their very recurrence in the largest sections of masonry suggests that these curtain tracts belong to a single construction effort. Interesting to note, however, is the substantially lower level of the spouts below the continuous parapet east of Tower XI. This situation is probably the result of the unique battlement requiring a different drainage system, and may relate to a different construction event. A more important question is how the opus incertum matched up with the previous ashlar circuit since efforts to integrate or explicitly differentiate the masonry may represent implicit political statements. As far as any sort of stucco embellishment is concerned the analysis above points out that the current remains, besides a few scant traces, offer little to work with. 576 Similarly, a door cut into the nearby limestone masonry probably offered access from the House of Championnet II (VIII.2.3) above. In an effort to reconstruct the appearance of the walls the individual wall descriptions and engravings of the earliest publications on Pompeii again offer some solace. We should keep in mind that these publications are part of an era that had far less detailed scientific standards than our modern age, and give us divergent pictures of the surviving remains. Several authors implicitly state that a stucco veneer covered the opus incertum curtain wall sections, but none mention whether it was smooth or replicated ashlar masonry. (Niccolini, 1910) For example, William Gell describes the stucco as deliberately imitating the opus quadratum masonry, but it is unclear whether he refers to the towers, the curtain, or both. (Anon, n.d.) Thomas Dyer, referencing Gell, is equally vague describing the opus incertum sections as covered in stucco to better fit in with the adjacent masonry. (Anon, n.d.) Johannes Overbeck is somewhat more specific describing sporadic remains of stucco still covering the opus incertum masonry in the middle of the nineteenth century. (Anon, n.d.) Illustrations scattered throughout early publications offer further conflicting views. These are sometimes simple vignettes, and more often prints of engravings derived from field drawings that may have lost some detail in the copying process. (Anon, n.d.) Most depict the exposed northern part of the fortifications from various angles, but only a handful seems accurate. Gell furnishes two drawings; the first depicting the section between Tower XI and the Porta Ercolano, and the second a close-up of Tower XII (fig. 74). Both show the lower sections of the curtain completely covered in a smooth stucco coating following the horizontal seams in the masonry. The accuracy is somewhat on the surface. (Anon, n.d.) Mazois in particular also details the presence of a secondary coat of stucco, suggesting a refurbishment of the decorative scheme (fig. 76). Recently Russo and Russo hypothesize the presence of a First-Style veneer on the entire post-Sullan circuit. Their theory relies on a study of the pockmarks created by the Sullan war machine on the wall sections on the north side of the city. Along with a handful of less clear examples, a hole in the fifth block on the exterior western corner of the Porta Vesuvio contains a plaster plug that is their primary evidence for a decorative stucco coating. If true, the theory solves both military and aesthetic issues; the stucco presented a uniform façade to onlookers and masked divergent, perhaps weaker, masonry. However, the problems with this theory are many, not least the complete absence of substantial stucco remains on the opus quadratum including the early illustrations examined above. (Anon, n.d.) Furthermore, the towers provide ample evidence that, under the right conditions, large tracts of the stucco coating may have survived intact. Even so, the authors dismiss the missing plaster as the result of its complete disintegration after its excavation. (Anon, n.d.) Otherwise lacking on the rest of the circuit, the stucco plugs may therefore represent patches preventing the scaling of the fortifications by both individuals and enemy troops. (Anon, n.d.) Roman law indicates just how much such an illegal scaling was undesirable whether to keep out thieves or contrabandists trying to avoid the policing 587 L. Rossini, Le antichità di Pompei: Delineate sulle scoperte fatte sino a tutto l'anno MDCCCXX (Roma, 1831), Pl. LXXV. See also Mazois Les ruines de Pompéi. Partie 1, pl. XXXVI figs. 1 and 2. Gell, Pompeiana, Pl. XV. Gell also describes a piece of cornice on the ground before the north bastion of the gate as part of a decorative feature that collapsed from the parapet above, but no further evidence exists to place it there. See also Breton, Pompeia décrite et dessinée, 240. 588 Russo and Russo, 89 a.C.: Assedio a Pompei, 71-75. (Anon, n.d.) The only plaster surviving on the opus quadratum is on the western bastion of the Porta Vesuvio. Here it remains stuck behind an arch jamb built in the post-earthquake period of the city. The niche of the Porta Stabia also still carry stucco. In both cases the embellishments are limited to the shrines rather than covering the entire masonry. (Anon, n.d.) As suggested by Prof. R. Taylor in a private conversation. function of gates. City walls constituted a special category known as res sanctae, or holy things, protected by, but not consecrated to, the gods. Scaling or crossing them illegally was a sacrilege punishable by death. (Anon, n.d.) Their status was probably related to the sulcus primigenius ritual since fortifications often closely shadowed the line of the pomerium in early colonial foundations. We have already noted the strong religious element associated with the Pompeian fortifications, and the new status of the city as a colony perhaps led to the strict enforcement of this law. Whether plain or imitating ashlar masonry, the evidence points to some sort of stucco coating originally covering the opus incertum in the curtain wall, however elusive it might be to us. In many ways it formed a dramatic contrast with the opus quadratum of the previous circuit, and created a discrepancy in the visual unity of the wall. Perhaps the reasons for its presence are merely practical. After all, opus incertum was now the cheapest and fastest building material, and the stucco may represent nothing more than a coat meant to protect the masonry from the elements. Nevertheless, the stucco clearly resonated and probably functioned in unison with the decorative embellishments present on the towers and gate vaults. The new sections clearly announced and readily identified the euergetism of those involved in the reconstruction of the walls and by extension the new social order in the city. This hypothesis seems particularly apt if we consider two key aspects: the associations of the First Style as applied on the exterior of buildings with the proper image of public structures; and the identity of Loreius and Cuspius, the two duumviri responsible for refurbishing the walls, as Roman colonists. In this context it is no 591 Digest 1.8.1-9 Gaius, Institues, book 1, in A. Watson, ed. The Digest of Justinian. (Philadelphia, 1985). . For further discussion on the matter see W. Seston, \"Les murs, les portes, et les tours des enceintes urbaines et le problème des res sanctae en droit romain.\" In Mélanges d'archeologie et d'histoire offerts á Andre Piganoil (Paris,1966), 1489-1498. coincidence that two of the most prominent visual landmarks of the city, the Temple of Minerva and the Temple of Venus, received new terracing walls during this refurbishment. As highlighted further below, these two goddesses played instrumental roles in the identity of the city. The masonry in such a prominent location undoubtedly carried a stucco embellishment and, as is true for the previous phases, created a powerful renewed connection between the walls, the deities protecting the city, and the sponsors of the reconstruction effort. Beyond their initial refurbishment, the curtain sections remained substantially unchanged until the earthquake of 62 CE. As emphasized further below, the area of public land associated with the walls continued to slowly shrink, overtaken by construction and accommodating burials. The walls slowly changed roles from an effective defensive line to a barrier with a diminished military function. After the earthquake the population used many areas in front of the curtain as dumps for the architectural debris resulting from the cleanup efforts. (Anon, n.d.) Most notably, large tracts adjacent to the Porta Stabia, Nocera, and Nola became open-air quarries spoliated for building material in the ensuing reconstruction. (Anon, n.d.) Although they lost much of their imposing appearance, the walls contributed immensely both psychologically and physically to the rebirth of the city. They acted as functional markers beyond which the population placed the ruins of the devastated city, and simultaneously provided the necessary material to contribute to its reconstruction.

Beyond the various tracts of the walls, a few gates received structural makeovers in the period between the installation of the Roman colony and the eruption of Vesuvius. Some carry the signs of multiple interventions, but it is hard to ascertain when they occurred. The Porta Marina is a case in point (fig. 77). It lies on the western edge of the Pompeian plateau forming a primary link between the coast and the Forum. Its backbone is a large barrel-vaulted corridor built in opus quasi-reticulatum and brick quoins set inside the limestone masonry of the first Samnite enceinte. Two vaulted entryways extend in front of it; a smaller passage for pedestrians, and a large entrance reserved for pack animals and horses since the road through the gate was too steep for cart traffic. A limestone bastion extends forward on the southern side and contains a niche where excavators recovered a broken terracotta statue of Minerva. The corridor features a walled up door on the north side and another still opens to an unidentified space on the south side. (Anon, n.d.) On the city side a large opus incertum terrace, built at a later date to support a portico heading to the houses above the gate, abruptly cuts off the sidewalk, forcing would-be pedestrians onto the flagstones. (Anon, n.d.) The Porta Marina has received a lot of scholarly attention concerning its date and construction sequence. (Anon, n.d.) The current communis opinio identifies the barrel vault as a modification built in the early years of the colony and the smaller outer vaults as added soon thereafter. The main vault likely replaced an elongated version of the typical 594 Perhaps they were a series of water tanks later supplanted by horrea but its original function remains unknown. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) In my opinion, the use of the opus vittatum mixtum construction technique points to a likely postearthquake reconstruction. (Anon, n.d.) See Brands, Republikanische Stadttore in Italien, 184. Kurt Wallat recently confirms its early colonial date through the analysis of the fired bricks in the quoins. See K. Wallat, \"Opus Testaceum in Pompeji.\" Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Römische Abteilung 100 (1993): 364. Pompeian tripartite gate stretching up to the top of the plateau near the current entrance of the Temple of Venus. 597 Its long cavernous layout and double entrance have led many scholars to see it as ornamental, functioning primarily as a police and tax barrier. (Anon, n.d.) Nevertheless, the Porta Marina also preserved considerable military capabilities in tune with the general uncertainty of the times and the wider upgrade of the civic defenses. (Anon, n.d.) The steep road approaching the gate was inaccessible to carts, let alone heavy complicated siege engines, and naturally added to its military strength. Furthermore, its layout and elevation transformed the gate into a powerful defensive tower-like structure where the added height resulted in better views and weapon reach. 600 A more pressing question is why this opening in particular received such an extensive refurbishment in the early colony. An answer may lie in two key factors in the wider urban context. The gate opened on the via Marina, linking the Forum with a side entrance of the basilica and the Temples of Venus and Apollo. Little noticed in Pompeian scholarship are the marble chips inserted in between the flagstones. They are unique in the city and serve to highlight the stateliness and importance of the road. Furthermore, the Temple of Venus in particular received new decorations as an explicit political statement in her role as the personal protectress of Sulla and her transformation from the Samnite Mefitis Fisica. (Anon, n.d.) Outside the walls the road led to the navalia, a series of harbor facilities built soon after the installation of the colony, where Roman navy ships docked on land at night and during the winter. The full importance of this facility remains unclear, but it 597 Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 116-117. 598 Mau first advanced this idea. See A. Mau, Pompejanische Beiträge (Berlin, 1879), 233-234. 599 See R. Palmer, \"Customs on Market Goods Imported into the City of Rome.\" Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome 36 (1980): 217-218. 600 Parallels of the type in exist in Perugia and Ferrentium. For further discussion see Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica 117. 601 L. Jacobelli and P. Pensabene, \"La decorazione architettonica del Tempio di Venere a Pompei. Contributo allo studio e alla ricostruzione del santuario.\" Rivista di studi pompeiani 7 (1995-96): 45. probably played a key role in the area until the Augustan development of the naval base across the bay at Misenum. (Anon, n.d.) The proximity to the Temple of Venus and the development of the naval facility explains the refurbishment of the Porta Marina as a marker of the new colonial realities in the city. During the course of the first century CE the suburban baths, the Villa Imperiale (VIII.1.a) and private houses eventually engulfed the gate, dramatically changing the layout of the area. A terrace of the villa completely buried a stretch of the pomerial road linking the gate to the river harbor further south. (Anon, n.d.) Along with the development of Misenum, this factor probably led to a loss of importance for the gate. Similarly, the urban development and the gate's proximity to the coast also explain its unique status as the only entrance to the city lacking tombs in front of it. (Anon, n.d.) Despite the urban development the gate continued to play an active role in the city. (Anon, n.d.) A similar situation existed in Rome where the gates of the Servian Wall, long surpassed by urban development, continued to mark the crossing points through its boundary. (Anon, n.d.) In this context they functioned in a similar fashion to honorary arches, a form that architects increasingly used to connect districts of the city. 607 602 E. Curti, \"Le aree portuali di Pompei.

She describes these gates as \"vibrant boundary markers where occupants changed their actions in response to municipal requirements\". (Anon, n.d.) See D. Scagliarini Corlàita, \"La situazione urbanistica degli archi onorari nella prima etá imperiale.\" In Studi sul arco onorario romano (Rome, 1979): 29-72. As a result, authorities carefully maintained the embellishments on Porta Marina and it retained most of its stucco coating at the time of excavation. Sadly, an allied aircraft bomb pulverized the outer vaults in the Second World War, and only a fragment of the decorative coat survives on the jamb of the northern arch. (Anon, n.d.) Drawings and photographs in early publications and guidebooks reveal a smooth stucco coat with a slightly raised socle covering the masonry, falling in line with the other gates of the city. (Anon, n.d.) The gate contained a shrine that was still in use at the time of the eruption. The presence of many graffiti, including one referencing the prostitute Attica and her fees, attest to the lively and vibrant role of the gate. 610 The Porta Vesuvio is another gate that witnessed extensive changes with the new colony when it became the designated site for the arrival of an aqueduct (fig. 14). The establishment of the colony brought with it the expectation to meet the proper Roman living standards that included a supply of flowing fresh water. (Anon, n.d.) As the highest point in the city, the Porta Vesuvio lent itself naturally to the task; its status as a public structure obviated the necessity of costly expropriations. The current water castellum, or distribution tank, on the west flank of the gate is the terminus of a branch of the Serino 608 García y García, Danni di guerra a Pompei, 167-171. Until then the stucco coat had actually sparked a scholarly debate upon the date of the gate as it covered much of the identifiable masonry and construction techniques.

Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 136. aqueduct built by Augustus to supply the Roman naval base at Misenum around 35 BCE (fig. 78). (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri first proposed its Augustan date, but Christopher Ohlig recently suggested an earlier Sullan phase coinciding with the completion of the Avella aqueduct. (Anon, n.d.) However, Duncan Keenan Jones has recently vigorously challenged this hypothesis, returning to Maiuri's thesis its first construction in the Augustan Age. (Anon, 2010) If we follow Ohlig's theory, the current version of the castellum had a predecessor in the form of an open air round nymphaeum set directly into the agger immediately west of the gate. The waterworks in this location created a deliberate visual statement announcing the arrival of the aqueduct into the city. A new wide plaza in front of it further stressed its presence to onlookers. The works necessary to build the castellum were substantial. They included the shortening of the western gate court by some 6.5 meters, the complete demolishing of its internal wall, and the construction of a new terrace to hold back the agger. (Ohlig, 2004) The new waterworks also affected the street network of the area. It closed the access to the pomerial road running at the base of agger, whereas the aqueduct channel approached the city slightly above ground, essentially cutting off the exterior route to the Porta Ercolano. In an effort to re-establish the connection, engineers raised the entire area between the two gates with a massive two-meter deep earth fill and built a road overtopping the aqueduct. (Ohlig, 2001) Construction of the channel through the fortifications posed further challenges. Workers had to negotiate the masonry of the curtain and the buried bastion adjacent to the gate. Ohlig envisions the removal and later reconstruction of the masonry to reach the level of the channel, but the outer curtain preserves no trace of this event unless workers carefully put back every single block in place. This scenario is certainly possible if we consider a deliberate desire to preserve the effect of the tufa/limestone façade of the outer curtain, but it seems unlikely; tunneling through the agger was probably a more practical solution. The overall consequences on the fortifications were dramatic. The external fill reduced their relative height, buried the tower posterns, and eliminated any outworks immediately in front of the walls (fig. 39, 72). Both Maiuri and Ohlig believe that these events were only possible after the walls had ceased to function militarily. (Anon, n.d.) Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that the decision to locate the castellum within the fortified perimeter, and the burial of the channel, imply a distinct desire to keep them out of reach and maintain the protective role of the fortifications despite their weakening. If we follow Ohlig's suggestion, the new complex also carried an implicit colonial statement; the partially demolished gate also symbolized lost independence and framed the new, distinctly Roman waterworks. Furthermore, the exterior earthwork also cancelled out the limestone/tufa juxtaposition of the curtain, a hallmark of Samnite Pompeii, in one of the most visible and powerful areas of the fortifications. This message seems particularly poignant assuming that funding for the aqueduct originated in Rome as part of the foundation of the colony. 618 617 Maiuri, \"Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano,\" 277-279, Ohlig \"Städtebauliche Veränderungen im Bereich des Pomeriums und der Porta Vesuvio,\" 93-102. (Anon, n.d.) Ohlig, \"Städtebauliche Veränderungen im Bereich des Pomeriums und der Porta Vesuvio,\" 104. colony, but a recent re-evaluation suggests that it was begun before the siege. (Anon, n.d.) In this context we may suggest that the gate vault perhaps accompanied and/or celebrated its completion in the early years of the colony. In the Augustan period, or soon thereafter, a raised causeway built in front of the gate eased passage into the city from the bustling river port nearby. The inscription mentioned previously commemorating how the duumviri L. Avianius Flaccus, and Q. Spedius Firmus renovated the road likely also refers to the construction of the causeway. (Anon, n.d.) The new roadway also bridged the defensive ditch in front of the gate, thereby significantly reducing its military effectiveness. It also compromised the natural drainage of rainwater through the passageway, leading to the construction of a sewer through the western agger that demolished the stairs leading up to the wall walk. 623 A few other gates experienced a similar change in the same period; the roads through the Porta Nola, Nocera, and Marina were lowered, and the Porta Ercolano and Vesuvio elevated. (Anon, n.d.) In practical terms these road works eased the passage into the city, and scholars associate these modifications with a general reduction of defensive concerns 621 See Wallace-Hadrill, Rome's Cultural Revolution, 131 on the construction of the small theater. 622 CIL X, 1064. See also Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 198. The date is somewhat uncertain. Castrén sees them in office in the early Julio-Claudian period. Castrén, Ordo Populusque Pompeianus, 141, 223. The new causeway may coincide with the closure of the pomerial road leading to the Porta Marina. A Claudian sestertius found beneath the paving stones below the vault points to a later date, but it may relate to a re-paving of the road. See G. Spano, \"Pompei.\" Notizie degli scavi di antichità 19 (1911): 377. 623 Recent excavations of the drain put its construction date to very late in the colony on the basis of wear pattern of the nearby fountain. See S.J.R. Ellis and G. Devore, \"Two Seasons of Excavations at VIII.7.1-15 and the Porta Stabia at Pompeii, 2005 -2006.\" Rivista di studi pompeiani 18 (2007): 124-125. It is possible, however, that this fountain associates with the construction of the Avella aqueduct. 624 At the Porta Marina and Nocera the works also led to a similar blockage of the sewers passing through the agger. For the Porta Vesuvio see Seiler et.al \"La regio VI insula 16 e la zona della Porta Vesuvio,\" 252. resulting from the establishment of the pax augusta. (Anon, n.d.) We shall discuss the role of the fortifications in this period further below, but we may note that Augustus promoted the construction of many enceintes and gates as part of his program of civic renewal on the Italian peninsula. At Pompeii the early Imperial period saw the construction of many politically inspired buildings as the Pompeian elite aligned itself with the new realities of power. (Anon, n.d.) In particular, the Eumachia building, the Temple to the Genius of Augustus, the shrine to the public lares on the east side of the Forum, and the private Temple to Fortuna Augusta farther north all celebrated the emperor and his cult. (Anon, n.d.) The changes to the roadways may seem subtle, but they included radical interventions: cutting back scarps, filling in defensive ditches, and the re-paving of roads. The result was a new emphasis on the gates of Pompeii. This seems especially the case where the lowered roadways added to the height of the gates and walls as one passed through the agger. The tall walls compounded the cavernous effect of the passageways already inherent in the design of forecourt gates, thereby enhancing their stateliness and the experience of passing through the limits of the city (figs. 43 and 71). If anything, although the martial function of the fortifications decreased, these modifications on the gates followed the wider urbanization processes occurring on the peninsula. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 219 and also Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 115. 626 As Guzzo, notes an overt marker of this process is the statue that the prominent Pompeian Holconius Rufus commissioned. He depicts himself as military general even though he never went to war to espouse these ideals. He even went as far as to mimic the Augustus Prima Porta. Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 170. (Anon, n.d.) Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 23. After these events the gates remained largely untouched until the effects of the 62 CE earthquake prompted a radical intervention on the Porta Ercolano. 628 This is a remarkable circumstance considering the heavy damage wrought on the area during the siege. Presumably, the gate needed some sort of repairs after the siege, but its scars were likely still present on the masonry as they are on the adjacent curtain wall today. They acted as visual reminder of the attack and conquest of the city, a message perhaps reinforced by the partial burial and reconstruction of the wall toward Porta Vesuvio. Excavated in the 1760's, and therefore on modern view for several centuries, First Style. (Anon, n.d.) Drawings published in the volumes of Gell and Overbeck-Mau illustrate two Ionic marble columns framing the exterior of the eastern pedestrian entrance, but their presence at the time was the result of an erroneous reconstruction using pieces from a nearby tomb. (Anon, n.d.) In similar fashion to the other city gates, the stucco was otherwise a plain white and functioned as an album containing graffiti, city ordinances, and announcements of gladiatorial games. Successive paint coats cleared the clutter, attesting to both the careful maintenance of the gate's appearance and its performance as a billboard in the city. 632 William Gell also published a reconstruction of the gate, a task that few others have attempted ever since. The author himself admits the rather speculative nature of the reconstruction and he projects the gate as a full-fledged Roman triumphal arch crowned with a great biga. (Anon, n.d.) Subsequent reconstructions varied the theme only slightly. Niccolini lowered the height of the two pedestrian entrances, whereas Delaunay published a more reserved version without the crowning biga (figs. 82 and 83). (Anon, n.d.) These somewhat overzealous reconstructions clash with the physical remains. For example, Gell reconstructs full double parapets on either side of the gate, but an inn and stable flanked the gate's southern side, and a staircase rather than the internal parapet abutted it to the north.

A word of caution on the accuracy of Delaunay, however, since he describes the side entrances on one of the towers as being the Porta Stabia, 12. recently, Brands points out the parallels between the Porta Ercolano and the Augustan cavaedium gate types at Fano, Torino, and Spello. (Anon, n.d.) These grand gates featured a similar open central court and the Porta Ercolano resembled their core passageway without the flanking towers. Scholars have questioned the nature of the gate and whether its function was primarily ornamental, defensive, or both. (Anon, n.d.) Open court gates have a clear military function to trap attackers and allow their bombardment from above. Yet the current remains preclude an easy access to the second floor except for an approach from the north. Although the gate resembled the design of the open court types, it likely did not achieve a full military functionality. The specifics of the scholarly debate need not concern us here since its monumental character is evident. In many ways it embodies the post-earthquake reconstruction effort. Its stucco embellishments fit into a roughly 180year old decorative tradition on the fortifications reflecting the proper image of the city that in the post-earthquake period simultaneously referenced its resilience and history. The choice of rebuilding the Porta Ercolano is also no coincidence since it straddled one of the most important routes of the city, connecting it directly with Rome. As noted previously, this circumstance likely led to the construction of the well-finished adjacent opus quadratum tufa masonry. By the time of the gate's reconstruction opulent villas, (Anon, n.d.)

See also Brands, Republikanische Stadttore in Italien, 190. 636 See Brands, Republikanische Stadttore in Italien, 188-190. Scholars have also focused their attention on the closing mechanisms and weather both interior and exterior entrances featured gates. The exterior entrances have no further evidence of closing mechanisms except for grooves intended to accommodate a portcullis shuttering over the main road. The presence of stucco in the rails, however, induced many to believe that the portcullis was never installed since it would have ruined the delicate coat when it opened or closed. See F. Niccolini and F. Niccolini, Le case ed i monumenti di Pompei. vol. 2 (Naples 1862), 9. Also, Overbeck and Mau, Pompeji in seinen Gebäuden, Alterthümen und Kunstwerken, 55. Monnier in particular sees the absent portcullis as a deliberate ploy to draw in attackers and trap them see Monnier, Pompéi et les pompéiens, 101. See also M. Monnier, The Wonders of Pompeii (New York, 1870), 96. In any event, the gate closed on the interior and could still function to keep unwanted elements from entering the perimeter of the walls. elite tombs, and a concentration of elite houses in Regio VI all lined the road, indicating that it retained its status as a prominent thoroughfare in the city. (Anon, n.d.) A new gate was also in the works at the Porta Vesuvio when the eruption occurred. Largely demolished in the earthquake of 62 CE, its new plan featured an elaborate double arch similar to the Porta Marina (fig. 14). Unlike its earlier counterpart, where a terrace eventually shut off the pedestrian sidewalk, the Porta Vesuvio already included a blind sidewalk dead-ending on the old limestone bastion. As mentioned previously, this space preserved a lararium at the time of excavation and the new arch further monumentalized the shrine, suggesting a concern with the aesthetic effects and religious connotations of the gate. The similarity with the Porta Marina is hard to dismiss and, like the Porta Ercolano, points to a continued unified conceptual presentation of the fortifications and the city. A recent hypothesis even proposes that the final design of the Vesuvian gate was a carbon copy of the Porta Ercolano. (Anon, n.d.) Although within the realm of possibilities, this theory remains hard to prove. Regardless of its final monumental appearance the reconstruction effort carried the same message. After the devastating seismic events of 62 CE, the area between the two gates became symbolic of the reconstruction effort since it received the greatest mass of architectural debris associated with the clean-up of the city. (Anon, n.d.) The reconstruction of the two gates therefore carried a further message of rebirth. This statement connected back to (Anon, n.d.) See F. Senatore, \"Necropoli e società nell'antica Pompei. Considerazioni su un sepolcreto di poveri.\" In Pompei, il Vesuvio e la penisola Sorrentina (Rome, 1999), 95. The Porta Ercolano necropolis seems to cater more to the rich where 48% of the tombs represent the elite, as opposed to the 20% of the Porta Nocera. The Porta Ercolano perhaps primarily served Regio VI where there seems to be a higher concentration of opulent houses. On the importance of key roads see Zanker, \"The City as Symbol: Rome and the Creation of an Urban Image,\" 25-41. (Anon, n.d.) On the matter see Frӧlich, \"La porta di Ercolano a Pompei e la cronologia dell'opus vittatum mixtum,\" 151. (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano,\" 278-280, describes large piles up to 1,60m deep outside these two gates. Colonia Augusta Ariminensis. (Anon, n.d.) The new Porta Ercolano probably carried similar messages, creating an interregional connection with Rome through its position on the via Consolare and celebrating the benevolence of the emperor financing the reconstruction effort. The message was clear: no other buildings could symbolize the rebirth of the city more effectively than renewal of the markers on its boundaries. Considering the important developments concerning the gates a few more remarks concerning their function in the city are in order. As mentioned, city gates played an important role as tax barriers. As a result they also carried strong associations with the political and legal authority of the city. Starting in the first century BCE scholars trace a distinct evolution in gate design that included multiple passageways to relieve the traffic congestion that resulted from their role as bottlenecks. This trend continued with the advent of the pax romana under the empire. (Anon, n.d.) Although gates retained a defensive role, this development signals a shift in emphasis toward more practical and monumental considerations in gate design. In fact, monumental gates designed with less emphasis on defense also symbolized the wider protection offered by the emperor and the empire, along with their celebration of local civic identity. (Anon, n.d.) As Cornelis van Tilburg recently points out, the exponential development of Pompeii in the Samnite period probably compounded the issues of traffic congestion. The narrow passageways of the gates probably exacerbated the problem. The appearance of pedestrian passageways in Pompeii is perhaps the result of efforts trying to relieve it. Authorities could separate cart traffic and pedestrians so that they both had an easier 644 J. Ortalli \"Nuove fonti archeologiche per Ariminum. Monumenti, opere pubbliche e assetto urbanistico tra la fondazione coloniale e il principato agosto.\" In Pro poplo arimenese. Atti Del Convegno Internazionale \"Rimini Antica. una respublica fra terra e mare (Faenza, 1995), 469-529. 645 Van Tilburg, \"Gates, Suburby and Traffic in the Roman Empire,\" 133-134 646 On this complex development and relationship see Thomas, Monumentality and the Roman Empire: Architecture in the Antonine Age, 108-113, 127 route into the city. (Anon, n.d.) Although the Porta Marina, due to its heavy slope, seems to preclude the passage of large carts, pack animals could still transit through the gate. Furthermore, the design probably also carried a symbolic element related to the new colony if we consider the construction of the navalia and the strong political associations of the Temple of Venus. Similarly, the post-earthquake emphasis on the gates seems as much a matter of projecting the rebirth of the city as it is a reassertion of local authority. In this context the Porta Ercolano is a prime example of this development. In practical terms the pedestrian passageways helped to regulate and relieve traffic congestion on a main artery into the city. More importantly, the gate not only symbolized the benefaction of the emperor, but also the return of order and the state after the devastating earthquake. These factors also explain the continued emphasis on the proper maintenance of the embellishments on the gates. Following the analysis of the curtain walls and gates, we return to the towers which, by and large, display similar trends. Many carry the unmistakable marks of repairs occurring mostly in the early colony. (Anon, n.d.) Tower II presents some radical alterations to its original structure. Parts of the remains contain modern restorations, but clear seams in the masonry confirm its layout. Brickwork laid in regularly spaced toothed quoins, a technique adopted with increasing sophistication in the first century BCE, confirms restoration work carried out after the siege (fig. 84). (Anon, n.d.) As addressed previously, the unusual floating postern on its western flank suggests a drastic lowering of the surrounding terrain. Equally unusual are the rectangular openings in the front and back walls of the main chamber. Assuming that the modern reconstruction is largely correct, it seems that at some point after the early colonial restorations the tower radically changed function with the addition of the large openings. The circumstances of Tower II are peculiar enough to merit a separate discussion below. Tower III to the east prominently displays opus vittatum mixtum quoins on the remaining corners of the main chamber and a patch of brickwork on the western wall (fig. Towers III, IV and V as mozzate, or chopped off, during the earthquake and never rebuilt. (Anon, n.d.) The emergency brick patchwork and the application of opus vittatum mixtum construction technique, however, are typical of the post-earthquake period. (Anon, n.d.) A small surviving patch of stucco on the eastern quoin points to the application of a new decorative coat restoring its appearance after the repairs. These interventions perhaps connect with a resumption of the burial activities in the necropolis below in the last years of the city after a brief period of abandonment. (Anon, n.d.) Heading toward the amphitheater, modern masonry almost entirely composes the remains of Tower IV and fall outside of our analysis (fig. 59). Tower V presents extensive toothed brickwork in its quoins and southern flank. The construction technique is very similar to that of Tower II suggesting that its refurbishment occurred in the early colony (fig. 86). The ground floor inside the tower has no pavement, and it remains (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri believed that the quoins represent an early imperial reconstruction based on the employment of opus vittatum mixtum at the Porta Ercolano that he dates to the Augustan period. Maiuri, \"Studi e ricerche sulle fortificazioni di Pompei,\" 232. (Anon, n.d.) Frӧlich convincingly shows that this technique is likely a post-earthquake introduction. See Frӧlich, \"La porta di Ercolano a Pompei e la cronologia dell'opus vittatum mixtum.\" 652 Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica, 151-153. unclear when or why it was removed. Modern masonry composes much of the structure higher up. If restored correctly, the floating back door and side entrances are probably the result of a lowering of the agger associated with the construction of the amphitheater in 70 BCE (fig. 60). A sliver of surviving opus vittatum mixtum masonry, set below a modern restoration on the first corner of the stairway, suggests a post-earthquake restoration carried out in conjunction with similar repairs on the neighboring amphitheater. (Anon, n.d.) Adjacent Tower VI does not indicate any major refurbishments in its surviving masonry. Like its neighbor, it also lacks a pavement on the ground floor. Curiously, the corridor accessing the postern sits some 1.5 meters lower than the door to the main chamber making it accessible only by stairs. The steps are otherwise missing, due perhaps to their original construction in perishable materials. Construction of the amphitheater lowered the agger enough to impede access thorough the rear and northern side entrance (fig. 87). As a result, only the southern doorway continued to offer direct access into the building. This is the second of the three towers surrounding the amphitheater clearly displaying measures that reduced its military effectiveness and enhanced its representational role. We shall return to this aspect below. Passed the Porta Sarno, Tower VII also presents clear evidence of restorations. The quoins on each side of the building still display traces of opus vittatum composed of small tufa blocks and set in broad teeth (fig. 88). The application of this technique is rare at Pompeii and its earliest attested use is in the large arcades of the amphitheater. (Anon, n.d.) Despite the different material, the concept behind the technique is similar to the (Anon, n.d.) The entire upper arcade of the amphitheater in opus vittatum mixtum is likely a post-earthquake reconstruction. Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 72. (Anon, n.d.) Adam, \"Building Materials, Construction Techniques and Chronologies,\" 108. Also, Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 72. brickwork highlighted in Towers II and V, and likely represents the same reconstruction event. Further west, the remains of Tower VIII still preserve most of their lower stucco and display clear signs of alteration and demilitarization. The arrow slits on the lowest floor were modified and partially filled in with masonry. Inside, white stucco frames carefully highlight the modified openings, implying their use for an unspecified period of time. On the exterior, extra stucco work masked the alterations but it remains unclear when this transformation occurred. The new arrow slits suggest that the tower changed its strategic role. The windows were clearly adjusted for small caliber weapons indicating that defenders no longer needed to worry about, or no longer possessed, the necessary organization to withstand well-organized sieges. Soon afterward the postern was walled up and the exterior covered with stucco to hide the alteration (fig. 89). (Anon, n.d.) Johannowsky suggests that defensive strategies called for the express camouflaging of the postern and troops would only smash through it in case of a sortie. However, the arch jambs still carry traces of a previous stucco coat indicating that it was once open. (Anon, n.d.) Instead, the careful application of new stucco marks a clear effort to preserve the representative aspect of the tower throughout its history. The earthquake subsequently damaged the building and it effectively ceased to function when a shabby concrete wall closed off the stairs leading to the main chamber. A few fragments of the tower recovered in the lapilli suggest that parts of the building were still standing at the time of the eruption, but that it largely stood abandoned and in ruins. 657 655 Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 28-31. Her excavations recovered dumped earthquake debris in front of the postern, supplying a terminus ante quem for its closure. (Anon, n.d.) Johannowsky, \"Considerazioni sull'architettura militare del II sec. a.C. nei centri della lega nucerina,\" 131. (Anon, n.d.) Chiaramonte Trerè, Nuovi contributi sulle fortificazioni pompeiane, 28-31. Nearby, the ruins of Tower IX differ significantly. Recent excavations have demonstrated that they are part of a post-Sullan reconstruction of the building that included the adjacent curtain wall. The same investigations recovered fragments of the previous tower as they had fallen during the siege. They still carried the original decorative First-Style stucco thereby providing direct evidence of the continuous use of the style on the towers. The remains preserve a barrel vault covering a large chamber (fig. 90). In the back a window surmounts a door that, in absence of the agger, opened onto a street. The lack of stairs and further windows have led the excavators to conclude that the new building only had a ground floor and eventually changed its function to a warehouse. Nevertheless, the exterior of the rebuilt structure also featured First-Style embellishments suggesting that it retained some sort military or public function in unison with the fortifications. (Anon, n.d.) The three towers on the north side of Pompeii do not reveal any distinct repairs in the masonry (fig. 91). As mentioned above, the deep fill that buried their posterns was the most radical change affecting the buildings and reduced their military capabilities. Interestingly, Maiuri discovered the postern and the stairs heading down to the main chamber of Tower XI walled up in a similar fashion to Tower VIII, but it remains unclear when or why this happened. (Anon, n.d.) The earthquake likely demolished large portions of the two western towers. In particular, Tower XII is missing its entire exterior façade and crude walls seal the passageways. Although some of its flanking arrow slits were walled (Anon, n.d.) Maiuri, \"Pompei isolamento della cinta murale fra Porta Vesuvio e Porta Ercolano,\" 292. Perhaps engineers closed the opening to facilitate the deposition of the earth fill and keep the corridor free from debris. up at an unspecified date, Tower X fared slightly better. Maiuri uncovered large parts of it collapsed in the eruption debris on the field side of the fortifications. 660 Claiming Public Land, Chipping away at the so-called Pomerium Perhaps one of the most consistent trends between the installation of the colony and the eruption is the progressive occupation of the stretch of public terrain associated with the line of the fortifications. Its limits began roughly at the base of the agger and moved out to some thirty meters in front of the fortifications. Nissen and Della Corte identified this stretch of land as the pomerium, or sacred boundary of Pompeii, based on the recovery of the cippi of Suedius Clemens each placed some thirty meters in front of the Porta Ercolano, Vesuvio, Nocera, and Marina (fig. 92). (Anon, n.d.) They displayed an inscription that reads: The cippi announced the work of the Tribune Titus Suedius Clemens sent to Pompeii, under the authority of Vespasian, to restore illegally occupied public lands to the city. Scholars have traditionally associated these public lands solely with the fortified line, but a recent theory points out that his intervention included the entire city and its hinterland. In actuality, the work Suedius carried out was part of a wider Vespasianic effort to reclaim public land that also involved Rome itself and cities such as Cuma and Cannae. (Anon, n.d.) Similarly, although the public character of land associated with the fortifications remains undisputed, its function as a pomerium is still debated. (Anon, n.d.) The establishment of a military zone around the fortifications was a matter of strategic importance; defenders could see and engage the enemy, and the attacker could 662 Translation after Mau, Pompei: Its Life and Art, 408 663 L.

During the history of the colony the ordo decurionum, or town council, had jurisdiction over the land. Starting in the Augustan period special dispensations allowed for the construction of honorary schola tombs awarded to prominent citizens in the space directly in front of the gates. (Anon, n.d.) Other types of burials also found their way into the public land but in less visible places. In 1854 excavators recovered some thirty-six cremation burials in the area in front of Tower VII. A few of the names carved into the nearby curtain walls likely refer to some of the individuals in the tombs (fig. 93). (Anon, n.d.) Over the years excavators have recovered further examples west of the Porta Nola and near the Porta Sarno. Also known as the sepolture dei poveri, or tombs of the poor, these were simple burials in a specially designated space for lower classes who could not afford lofty monuments. Coins found in the graves date between Pompey and Tiberius, suggesting a long use of the area. (Anon, n.d.) Other tombs recovered near the amphitheater and outside of the Porta Nola and Sarno, were simple burials for members of the Praetorian Guard. (Anon, n.d.) The Senate dispatched them to Pompeii to restore order to the city after the riot of 59 CE, and their burial in public land likely related to their special status. 670 665 See Tacitus histories 3.30. He vividly describes how attacking troops used buildings illegally built near the walls as firing platforms in offensive operations during the siege against Vitellius in Cremona. See also Lawrence, Greek Aims in Fortification, 39. 666 To date only the Porta Marina and Porta Sarno do not have any evidence of schola tombs. On the type see L.

The housing expansion initiated in the second century BCE continued to encroach upon the city walls stretching between the Porta Ercolano and the Doric Temple. As mentioned, early properties still allowed for a measure of defense since their wide-open terraces were able to accommodate defensive troops. With the advent of the colony the houses eventually spilled over and incorporated the walls (fig. 46). (Tybout, 2007) The exact phasing of this process remains elusive and probably occurred on an individual property basis continuing well into the Julio-Claudian period and beyond. (Anon, n.d.) Identifying the old line of the walls became increasingly difficult and owners deliberately covered up the masonry of the city walls with wall paintings. (Anon, n.d.) Only the House of Umbricius Scaurus (VII.16.15), straddling the walls slightly north of the Porta Marina, included a nod toward the ancient fortifications with a new luxury wing extending slightly beyond the walls built to resemble a defensive tower. (Pesando et al., 2006) Private property also started chipping away at the fortifications in Regio VI after construction of the Augustan castellum led to the closure of the inner pomerial road at the base of the agger. The effect upon the city walls was less dramatic, essentially turning most of the north-south roads of the Regio into private dead-end streets. The House of the Vestals (VI.1.7) eventually incorporated a large part of the agger between the Porta Ercolano and Tower XII. (Anon, n.d.) As the Vespasianic intervention suggests, the expansion of the houses onto the fortifications was not always legal. Nevertheless, they most likely occurred with permission of the ordo decurionum since these projects are too massive and well-coordinated to represent illegal construction activity. (Anon, n.d.) As the expansion continued the old city walls faded away and together with them went the identity of Samnite Pompeii. 677 Broadly speaking, the evidence above highlights a distinct trend: the city walls received an early refurbishment, followed by a weakening of the line in the Augustan period, and ending with reconstruction efforts of the northern gates in the post-earthquake period. These developments largely fall in line with the wider political and historical events of the centuries in consideration. Throughout the history of the Roman colony the walls seem to dramatically change function from a defensive to a more ceremonial role. We have already noted that the First-Style stucco on the towers and gates projected their association with the proper image of the city, but the fortifications also embodied the notions of romanitas, securitas, dignitas, and virtus. The extent to which these notions were associated with the walls changed over time, achieving various degrees of complexity that hinged upon the changing urban, social, and political developments. Given the instability of the Italian peninsula during the early colony, military considerations likely motivated Cuspius and Loreius to rebuild the walls. In this context, the hypothesis identifying the reconstruction occurring in conjunction with the revolt of Spartacus is certainly plausible. Nevertheless, their actions are also appropriate to the establishment of the colonial identity and their euergetism is also an extension of their (Anon, n.d.) Jacobelli, \"Pompei fuori le mura. Note sulla gestione e l'organizzazione dello spazio pubblico e privato,\" 57-58. (Anon, n.d.) Tybout, \"Rooms with a View,\" 408. colony's position in hostile territory. As a result major city gates heralded the entrance back into civilization and projected romanitas, or Romanness, and the protection of Rome. In this context the fortifications also acted as engines of mutual assimilation. (Rebecchi, 1987) City walls were therefore inherently symbolic of a colony's status, signifying its allegiance to Rome, but also its liberty and independence as the privileged markers of actually possessing them. (Février & Pinder, 1969) Pompeii was not an ex-novo foundation, but these ideals likely permeated the new colony, leading to the necessity to rebuild the walls in a way that had little bearing on their intrinsic military value. A multitude of factors led to the successive weakening of the fortifications. With the establishment of the pax augusta the focus on defending the empire shifted to faraway frontiers. As a result, some scholars describe the city walls built during this period as ceremonial rather than defensive. (Anon, n.d.) At Pompeii the period saw a progressive reduction of the defenses with easier access routes into the city and the increased occupation of the fortified line. This phenomenon has led scholars to identify a slow and inexorable decline of the fortifications, including outright abandonment. Yet the evidence suggests that the gates continued to form crucial controlled passageways in and out of the city, perhaps as a reflection of the new emphasis on the state. This development reflects a similar situation occurring in Rome, where the expansion of the city eventually took over and incorporated the line of the Servian Wall built in the fourth century BCE. As the limits of the empire grew, so did the city, and the two conflated to symbolize the power of the Roman state. 686 An explanation for the degraded military capabilities of the walls may also lie in the absence of a regular body of troops to maintain the walls. Three cohorts were stationed at Pompeii during the first civil war and they offered Cicero control of the city as he passed through on his way to join Pompey in Greece in 49 BCE. (Anon, n.d.) Their presence may explain some minor modifications such as those present on Tower VIII. Presumably the pax augusta led to their withdrawal and re-deployment elsewhere. It is not until after the riots of 59 CE between the Nucerians and Pompeians that the Senate sent the Praetorian Guard to restore the order and troops were once again in the city. Their deployment perhaps explains some of the minor repairs carried out on the towers and wall curtain in the last years of the city. Despite their faltering, the defenses still formed a formidable barrier and, as highlighted above, the city added a new emphasis on the gates in the early Imperial period. Perhaps a more productive line of approach to establish their role is to try and answer what exactly the walls intended to keep out. As mentioned in the introduction, city walls also kept out unwanted elements including wild beasts and bandits. These factors clearly played a role throughout the history of the city, but they are particularly clear for the colonial period. In particular wild wolves spotted within the perimeter of the walls were one of the worst omens that could befall a Roman city. They represented an affront to the city's protective gods and also symbolized, death, war, and the wider threats posed by dangerous species. 688 Bandits were similar undesirable elements. They 686 Favro, \"A City in Flux. The Animated Boundaries of (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, 1890)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) Trinquier, \"Les loups sont entrés dans la ville: de la peur du loup a la hantise de la cité ensauvagée,\" 85-118 these threats and, without the immediate danger of organized armies attacking the city, their makeup changed to reflect their role. The post-earthquake shift in emphasis on the gates of the city may find an explanation in the continued connection between the city and its hinterland. The two were not mutually exclusive and gates acted as formalized filtering points for the continuous movement of produce and the population. (Anon, n.d.) The Porta Marina, for example, continued to function as a boundary marker despite the urbanization process occurring around it. In simple terms gates continued their role as tax barriers and we find parallel examples in the custom points first designated under Augustus specifically for this purpose in Rome. Their role became so important that architects of the later Aurelian wall included many existing toll points in its circuit rather than designating new gates to the city. A striking connection with Pompeii lies in the redefinition of the custom points in Rome during the censorship of Vespasian and Titus in 73-74 CE, and perhaps further explains the emphasis on the gates in the final years of the city, especially if we consider the work of Suedius Clemens returning illegally public land to the state. (Anon, n.d.) In this context, it is not surprising that the gates on the north side were the objects of an elaborate reconstruction despite the fact that many areas of the curtain walls were abandoned. Beyond the practical reasons for the changes in the fortifications they continued to resonate in the social and urban matrix of the city. The influx of veterans marked a dramatic shift in its demographic and social make-up, but the exact connotations of this event remains debated. Scholars estimate their numbers anywhere between an entire legion, i.e., 4000-5000 men, and about half that number, all bringing with them family and dependents. (Anon, n.d.) The debate also concerns the extent of property reallocation, a process that often accompanied the establishment of a colony, where the new settlers lived, and how they interacted with the local population. (Anon, n.d.) A point of contention is that many of the grand houses remained in the hands of the old aristocracy, but proscriptions did occur and many properties changed hands. (Anon, n.d.) In broad terms scholarship now identifies three main areas where more affluent colonists settled; the large agricultural villas north of the city, a series of houses lining the via Marina/via dell'Abbondanza axis near the Forum, and the houses along the south and western ridge of the city. (Anon, n.d.) These concentrations reflect the new order; the reallocation of the villas represent an economic takeover, the dwellings near the Forum highlight the presence of the elite near the political center of the city, and the houses along the ridge exploited the views and luxury of the city for the new (Anon, n.d.)

If land reallocation did occur it probably was never completed or the colonists quickly sold their allotments. For the latest on the matter see Savino, \"Note su Pompei colonia sillana: popolazione, strutture agrarie, ordinamento istituzionale,\" 448-455. 696 See J.

He borrows this method from Zevi who used it to identify many of new owners of villas outside of Pompeii as pro-roman or even just Roman colonists. See F. Zevi, \"La città sannitica l'edilizia privata e la Casa del Fauno.\" In Pompei 1. (Naples, 1991) 71-72 and also Zevi, \"Pompei dalla città sannitica alla colonia sillana: per un'interpretazione dei dati archeologici,\" 130, and Lo Cascio,\"Pompei dalla città sannitica alla colonia sillana: le vicende istituzionali,\" 122. Pesando justly warns against reading too much into this phenomenon as redecorations do not necessarily point to new owners.

Other, less affluent colonists probably found a home somewhere northwest of the city in the newly founded Pagus Augustus Felix Suburbanus. (Anon, 1992) Perhaps the most overt markers of transformation of the city are the construction of the amphitheater, the completion of the so-called Odeion Besides examples such as the House of the Faun where the stucco clearly helped mask earthquake repairs, it is unclear what exactly motivated the decision to cover the tufa façades. To some extent it may relate to the notion of \"façadism\" where the owner deliberately chose to preserve or change façades as a reflection of his identity, status, or even political allegiance. (Anon, n.d.) Stephan Mols recently pointed out that the First Style on the exterior of buildings saw a particular resurgence in the Augustan period as a reflection of the renewed emphasis on social mores during his reign. This connection also relates to the proposed origin of the style as an imitation of Athenian civic architecture and the Augustan exaltation of the Classical Greek aesthetic. (Anon, n.d.) The application of the First Style in the Augustan period, therefore, seems to respond to the fashion and politics of the time. It may also reflect a conscious effort to replicate the effect of white marble, especially if we consider its role as a status marker after the opening of the Carrara marble quarries under Augustus. (Anon, n.d.) In fact, the very opening of these quarries allowed the emperor to boast that he transformed Rome into a city of marble and went hand in hand with the development of the new Imperial ideology. (Anon, n.d.) The notions of civic duty and private euergetism to the community were particularly strong in Roman society. It was duty of those who had the resources to (Anon, n.d.) The idea that it might relate to façadism in particular came up in a private conversation with Prof. Clarke. Recently J. Richards broadly defines facadism as the deliberate preservation of the facades of historic buildings, while a new building may appear behind it, or the choice of erecting replicas. Similarly architects may design specific facades to fit into and reflect an already existing cityscape. See J. Richards, Facadism (London, 1994), 7. Such elements may have played a part in the deliberate retention of the tufa facades. The elaboration of this hypothesis, however, merits further investigation elsewhere. (Anon, n.d.) As suggested by S. T.A.M. Mols, \"Il Primo Stile 'retró': dai propilei di Mnesicle a Pompei,\" 245. 707 Zanker Pompeii. Public and Private Life, 117 708 P. Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (Ann Arbor, 1988), 105. contribute to the well-being of the community. It is important to remember that the individuals sponsoring projects dictated the style, building types, and their placement in the city, thereby implicitly reflecting their ideology. (Anon, n.d.) Extending their benevolence on the community through the construction of fortifications was therefore an important symbolic act that carried with it political calculation. Furthermore, it was through the power of their office and their personal wealth that these men could set in motion building programs. Ambitious projects were therefore also the object of jealously and sometimes blocked when those who sponsored them were set to gain too much influence on the community. Nevertheless, euergetism was part of the politics of the period since grand endowments promoted the status of the individual amongst the population. Wealthy provincial individuals hoping to join the political process in Rome first had to prove their mettle at home. (Anon, n.d.) A brief look at the actions of the men of the early ordo decurionum serves to highlight their role in the early colony and further explains why figures such as Loreius and Cuspius chose specifically to rebuild the fortifications. The two most prominent men of the ordo, Marcus Porcius and Quinctius Valgus, were fedelissimi of Sulla and both profited handsomely from his proscriptions. Their personal advancement was directly related to Sulla's cause and their building activity reflected both their personal ambition and that of the Roman dictator. They were responsible for the completion of the teatrum tectum and the amphitheater, two of the most imposing buildings of the new colony. Valgus in particular was very familiar with the importance of architecture as a means to define a city and therefore its use to advance such claims. Originally from Hirpinia, he served as patronus municipii, or city patron, in Aeclanum, where he paid for the (Anon, n.d.) Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society, 24. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) construction of the city walls including the towers and gates. (Anon, n.d.) He is also mentioned as a duumvir quinquennalis for an unidentified settlement near Abellinum where he built the city walls and gates, the Forum, the Curia, and a cistern. (Anon, n.d.) His sponsorship of city walls attests to the role these structures played in the establishment of urban identities, and the ideals of the new elite of Pompeii. These elements suggest that the reconstruction of the fortifications was a reflection of the city's colonial status and part of the euergetism expected from its leaders. (Anon, n.d.) It was in the interest of the local elite, therefore, to achieve a complete civic image as part of their own political claims. Interestingly, Pompeii by this stage had already built many of the buildings that could define it as a Roman city. In fact, it included a Forum and a Basilica; spaces which were inherently part of what constituted a Roman colony. (Anon, n.d.) Pompeii likely adopted them as part of its alliance with Rome. Nevertheless, the buildings erected and modified in the early colony period reveal a distinct effort to further claim the city as Roman. For example, the modifications to the Temple of Apollo, one of the oldest cults in the city, were a clear act of appropriation. Similarly, the transformation of the Temple of Jupiter into a capitolium was a reference to Rome. Furthermore, its placement facing the open forum followed a blue print stretching back to the earliest Roman colonial foundations such as Ostia. Other building types such as the amphitheater and the Palestra were new but became typically 711 CIL I 2 1722 712 ILLRP 598.

The author specifically outlines how cities allied to Rome willfully adopted Roman architectural forms, perhaps even as a mirror of colonies such as Cosa and Alba Fucens. appropriate to a proper Roman city. (Anon, n.d.) Fortifications were, as we have seen, part of these essential buildings that expressed its romanitas and an integral part of colonies. It seems evident, therefore, that the reconstruction of the fortifications was a necessity beyond immediate military concerns. In this context these powerful notions also reflected upon Loreius and Cuspius, their personal ambition, and their influence upon the community. Valgus and Marcus Porcius built the structure and donated it in perpetuity to the colonists of the city. (Anon, n.d.) Scholars have related the choice of locating it in this quarter of the city to a general lack of urbanization and a matter of expediency as the agger supported over half the structure. Recent reevaluations, however, suggest a more complicated reasoning tying the building in to the status of Pompeii as a colony. To a certain extent the traditional views still hold true; engineers likely chose the agger as a convenient terrace to shore up the building. This factor is also true since this is one of the first attested stone amphitheaters, and at this early stage architects were still experimenting with the form. (Anon, n.d.) Similarly its placement in a relatively underdeveloped area of the city allowed for the (Anon, n.d.)

New archaeological discoveries, however, have revealed a distinct urbanization of the regio perhaps along the lines of the agricultural houses present before the eruption. To build the amphitheater the duoviri needed to conduct costly expropriations, demolitions, and perhaps even receive special dispensation from the city council to build on the city walls. (Anon, n.d.) Tybout has even gone as far as relating the choice of placing the building directly on the fortifications to a political statement of conquest and subjugation rather than just a simple matter of convenience.foot_138 More importantly, the amphitheater also carried a relationship to the army, and its veterans, and the colonial identity of the city. A recent theory sees the amphitheater as part of a wider military entertainment complex that included an early version of the neighboring Palestra. (Anon, n.d.) Although an early version of the Palestra remains uncertain, the notion of an entertainment complex initially designed specifically for veterans seems plausible. A building this large carried intrinsic meanings beyond its connections to gladiatorial fighting and included a strong relationship between the army and the Roman colonies of the late Republic. By the first century BCE soldiers trained in gladiatorial techniques and watched spectacles to introduce them to the brutal realities of battle. (Anon, n.d.) Army camps often included amphitheaters and its appearance at Pompeii with a contingent of veterans is a clear result of these associations. In this context the connection between the amphitheater and army camps included visual similarities between the stairways of the arena and the ramps flanking camp gates, giving its façade a reference lost on the modern viewer. (Anon, n.d.) The new amphitheater also acted on a regional level as a spectacular landmark the Catiline conspiracy. The orator praised Sulla as an exemplary citizen and pointed to his role as an arbiter quelling dissension and tensions between the two populations in the colony. The exact connotations of these disputes are the matter of an extensive scholarly debate that we need not revisit here but, as a recent theory prudently points out, the tensions most likely also divided along the pro-Roman and pro-Italian lines of the Social War.foot_141 Given Pompeii's previous allegiance, the intensity of the conflict, and its lingering effects, authorities probably isolated the towers as a security measure. Similarly the revolt of Spartacus, quelled only after a long and bloody conflict that directly involved Campania and the environs of Pompeii, had exposed the dangers related to the gathering of large numbers of gladiators. In both cases the inaccessibility of the towers prevented their hostile takeover during an uprising or riot, and provided a powerful reminder of civic order especially if they were visibly manned during gladiatorial contests. If we follow the traditional dating sequence, the addition of the so-called Palestra radically changed the district with the advent of the empire. The building became part of an organic unit with the amphitheater and its presence altered the meaning of the walls in the district. (Anon, n.d.) The Palestra, in essence a large three-sided portico with an internal pool, is still massive and of equal size to the amphitheater occupying some six regular insulae of the city. Its exact function remains somewhat obscure, but it seems to have worked as a physical and moral courage needed to command units in combat. (Anon, n.d.) Considering the associations between the nearby amphitheater, the fortifications, and their embellishments, a wider symbolism seems at work in the area. Together they projected virtus, the Augustan renewed emphasis on social mores accompanying the image of the proper colony. This was the strongest beliefs connected to military life and, along with the notion of pietas, fundamental to the Augustan ideals accompanying the program of civic renewal and construction of city walls on the Italian peninsula.

One of the most dramatic changes coinciding with the arrival of the colonists is the shift in burial practice from inhumation to cremation, and the appearance of monumental tombs lining the roads in and out of the city. (Anon, n.d.) The aim was promotion of oneself and the gens, resulting in the owners of the tombs jockeying for the best and most prominent locations. Their proximity to the fortifications led to an architectural dialogue between the two, reflecting therein the idea of the city (fig. 98). Tombs were primarily de Maele and J.M. Fossey (Amsterdam, 1992): 211-224. He explains how these twin notions were central to Augustan ideals and the construction of city walls throughout the peninsula. 735 S. Cormack, \"The Tombs at Pompeii.\" In The World of Pompeii, edited by P. Foss and J.J. Dobbins (New York, 2007), 586. representative of the individual, and their relationship with the fortifications highlights the image of the ideal citizen and hence the city. Tomb forms are notoriously difficult to differentiate chronologically, but Pompeii seems to follow a few distinct trends. (Hesberg, 2003) The so-called aedicula tombs found outside of the Porta Nocera were a particularly popular form in the early colony. They feature a high base supporting an aedicula or cella usually displaying statues of the deceased. (Anon, n.d.) The type lost popularity in the Julio-Claudian period when new more elaborate forms appeared in conjunction with the rise of wealthy freedmen who replaced some of the established elite. The new forms included the schola, circular superstructure, chamber, and altar-type tombs that expressly mimicked civic honorific architecture in an effort to connect the deceased with the image of the city. (Anon, n.d.) The dialogue between civic and funerary structures continued with the use of the First Style on the exterior of tombs where it symbolized the notions of citizenship and the city. The aedicula tombs in particular alluded more directly to the city walls. The surviving decoration suggests that they lacked the orthostate-ashlar sequence otherwise characteristic of the First-Style. Instead they only displayed stucco imitative ashlars as a reflection of the masonry that made up the city walls and the embellishments on the towers and gates. The correlation between the two is likely an explicit reference to the role of the newly refurbished fortifications as markers of the city, or as the functional dividers between the realm of the living and the dead, or both. (Anon, n.d.) A further connection perhaps lies in the shape of the aedicula tombs and the nearby towers. Most known examples of the type lie on the western side of the Porta Nocera necropolis at the foot of Tower II. As described previously, the tower stood on a high isolated podium, as did its nearby neighbor to the east. Along with their construction technique of brick quoined opus incertum, the architectural similarity between towers and tombs is striking. The large opening on the façade of Tower II may reflect its later transformation into an aedicula similar to the tombs, or for that matter, some of the other funerary structures featuring high podia nearby (fig. 99). Excavation notebooks report the discovery of an epitaph in the main chamber of the tower during the excavations of the 1950s. The report describes its recovery in a layer of backfill deposited inside the building sometime after its first excavation in the 1800s. (Anon, n.d.) Although this is a secondary context, the epitaph presumably came from the near vicinity-perhaps even from the building itself (fig. 100). The notebook tells us its dimensions, 42x28x4 .5 centimeters, and the literal transcription reads: P. TIN. TIRIVS. P. T. ADIVTOR. ET TIN. TIRIAE. ESTAE ILIAE. SVAE. V. ANNVII ET. SIBI ET. PONTIAE.

SO 739 Mols, \"Il Primo Stile 'retró': Dai propilei di Mnesicle a Pompei,\" 245-246 in particular points to tombs 3S, 13 OS, 9 OS, 29 OS. 740 The excavation reports are incredibly vague describing the recovery of the epitaph in what the excavators designate tower 1. Assuming continuity in excavation nomenclature, this associates it with Tower II since Maiuri later describes it as 1. See Maiuri, Pompei ed Ercolano: Fra case e abitanti, 82-83. RI. SVAE. ET SVIS Unfortunately no other information exists regarding the epitaph and the transcription in the excavation diary seems to contain a few errors. An aggressive translation may read as follows: Publius Tintirius Audiutor, son of Publius [made this] for his daughter Tintiria ...esta [beginning of name apparently lost] (she lived 7 years) and for himself and Pontia Hedyma, his gentle wife and their [family?] 741 The Tintiria gens mentioned in the epitaph are not well attested in Pompeian epigraphy with the exception of N. Tintirius Rufus, who served as an aedile in the year 2 BCE. This was a comparatively low office amongst those available in the governance of the city, but it attests that, for a time at least, the Tintirii were part of the Pompeian elite and perhaps competed for prominence in the funerary landscape. (Anon, n.d.) Considering the inherent height and dominant position of the tower, its re-use as a tomb is not inconceivable in a period when individuals increasingly appropriated the terrain belt associated with the fortifications. In addition, the competition for space in the Porta Nocera necropolis rapidly increased as it expanded first toward the Porta Stabia and later toward the amphitheater in the Julio-Claudian period. (Anon, n.d.) In these circumstances, the 741 I wish to thank Prof. A. Riggsby for his invaluable translation of the text. (Anon, n.d.) Castrén, Ordo Populusque Pompeianus, 229. (Anon, n.d.) See A. Emmerson, \"Reconstructing the Funerary Landscape at Pompeii's Porta Stabia.\" Rivista di studi pompeiani 21 (2010): 77-86. Also D'Ambrosio and De Caro, Un impegno per Pompei, 24-25. tower carried the distinct advantages of prominent display and architectural drama essential in tomb construction. Its transition into private hands may also explain its derelict state, if the expropriations conducted by Suedius Clemens led to the partial demolition of the building. Although we cannot prove that the expropriations led to the demolition of tombs, a nearby schola tomb strikingly displays the signs of a similar fate (fig. 101). (Anon, n.d.) Admittedly, the evidence for a complete transformation of the tower into a tomb is somewhat circumstantial, but it does help explain the curious remains. In any event, the correlation between fortifications and funerary architecture continued more tangibly in the walls that increasingly fenced off tombs starting in the first century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) Outside of Pompeii, a series of unique late-Republican miniature funerary reliefs found mostly in Campania and central Italy, further elucidate the connection between the enclosures and city walls. (Anon, n.d.) The reliefs separately depict the typical monumental cavaedium (court) gates, and towers similar to those of Torino and Spello that appeared in Italy during the Augustan program of civic renewal (fig. 83). (Anon, n.d.) Although most examples are now without context, they probably appeared in tomb enclosures to mimic the city walls that were often located nearby (fig. 102). In a similar fashion to the role of city walls, the precincts symbolically separated the dead from the living and signaled the social status of the tomb owners as freedmen who strongly 744 This is the only schola tomb immediately outside of the Porta Nocera and its owner is unknown.

The connection between the two is clear and fortifications continued to form a powerful reference point for civic identification. At Pompeii many of the enclosure walls functioned in a similar manner and kept unwanted things and people away from the buildings. Amongst the surviving examples many have doorways offering access to the tombs, whereas others featured small jogs to secure a ladder, or included rough lava boulders set as steps in the concrete to climb over the wall. (Anon, n.d.) The most prominent enclosures, located primarily in the Porta Ercolano necropolis, featured further decorations. For example, the Tomb of N. Festius Ampliatus prominently displayed gladiatorial reliefs on the exterior. Another pair of gladiators is painted on one of the interior walls of the Tomb of Caius Vestorius Priscus at the Porta Vesuvio. These scenes are particularly apt to the funerary realm given the funerary origin of the combats. (Anon, n.d.) Another common theme is the presence of small merlons marking the enclosures. (Anon, n.d.) On occasion the merlons also featured small detailed scenes related to the funerary realm including scenes of offering, or depictions of the Oedipus and the sphinx (fig. 103). The two merlons facing the road on the cenotaph of the augustales C. Calventius Quietus featured Victoria carrying a Celtic horn, a motif borrowed from triumphal art. (Anon, n.d.) As is the case with the Palestra, these merlons referenced the ideal of (Anon, n.d.) See F. Rebecchi, \"Antefatti tipologici delle porte a galleria. Su alcuni rilievi funerari di età tardorepubblicana con raffigurazione di porte urbiche.\" Bullettino della commissione archeologica comunale di Roma 86 (1978-79): 153-166. Also see von Hesberg, Römische Gräbbauten, 63. In the Etruscan figurative tradition gates often represented the separation between the dead and the living, and were sometimes represented as city gates. See G. Camporeale, \"La città murata d'Etruria nella tradizione letteraria e figurativa.\" In La città murata in Etruria (Pisa 2008): 22. 749 Typical examples are: the Tomb of M. Obellius Firmus outside of Porta Nola, tomb ES7 at the Porta Nocera, and South tomb G at the Fondo Pacifico. 750 Kockel, Die Gräbbauten vor dem Herkulaner Tor in Pompeji, 75, 84. 751 The most marked examples are tomb ES5 at the Porta Nocera, the tombs of Marcus Veius Marcellus and Caius Vestorius Priscus outside the Porta Vesuvio, Tomb of Naevoleia Tyche (süd 22), Tomb of Numerius Istacidius Helenus (süd 21), Tomb of C. Calventius Quietus (süd 20) Caius Fabius Secundus (süd 18), and Aulus Umbricius Scaurus (süd 17). 752 Many disappeared soon after excavation but Mazois recorded four surviving examples. One merlon featured Victoria carrying a Celtic horn, a motif borrowed from triumphal art. A second depicted Oedipus probably served to foster erudite conversations during elaborate meals (fig. 106). It is a simultaneous narrative of the story from the moment the son of Daedalus plunges to his death after nearing the sun to the recovery of his body. (Anon, n.d.) Notably the artist depicted Crete, or Knossos, in the background as a heavily fortified city showing its walls surrounding a mass of unidentifiable buildings. The towers and the gates prominently face the viewer and stand out as the most obvious markers of the city. The artist displays the fortifications as robust ramparts built in regular ashlar isodomic masonry that may reflect the opus quadratum of the walls of Pompeii. More importantly, it is not the collection of buildings that symbolize the city, but rather their placement behind the protection of fortified defenses that complete its image and status. The House of the Lararium of Achilles (I.6.4) contains a similar but more simplistic example in the stucco frieze depicting the Homeric cycle in a sacellum dedicated to the familial cult. In three separate instances the artist, although clearly constrained by the limited space of the frieze, chose to render Troy as a simple large city gate flanked by two large towers (fig. 107). Each scene depicts the departure from or the arrival to Troy, whether it is Hector in the act of leaving to confront Achilles, the dragging of his body around the city, or Priam recovering his remains. (Anon, n.d.) The gate vault is overly large to accommodate the figures. The gate itself is reminiscent of the large tower-flanked gates built in the Augustan period throughout the Roman west. In both cases, and these are certainly not isolated examples, the visual and imaginative concept of 758 See V.

Scagliarini Corlàita (Bologna, 1997): 37-38. the city translated to the fortifications enclosing it more than any other architectural element. 760 Images of fortifications also gained popularity as framing bands in black-andwhite mosaics during the first century BCE. They originate from the imitative carpet fringes bordering Hellenistic mosaics. 761 Although lost to us, the most elaborate carpets were probably a status symbol, and the translation of their borders into city walls may reflect similar connotations of elite ostentation and perhaps even citizenship. The earliest examples of fortified bands date to the late third and mid-second century BCE and were found in opulent houses in the Roman colonies of Atri and Suasa in Italy (fig.108). 762 They likely referred to the notions of securitas, dignitas, and the projection of Roman power associated with the fortifications of colonies exposed in enemy territory. In the late Republic and early Principate they became particularly popular in Italy and the Roman west as explicit emblems of romanitas reflecting the real fortifications built in new 760 Simple representations of city walls appear in the early third century BCE Esquiline tomb of Fabius or Fannius. Here at least one scene shows a simple monolithic wall with merlons representing a city. Later more complicated renditions of city walls coincide with broader urban images such as the fresco depicting a city in a cryptoporticus beneath the Baths of Trajan in Rome. The fresco illustrates an ideal Roman city complete with characteristic monuments, such as temples and theaters, and the city walls feature prominently as part of the urban ideal.

(Iorio, 2008) In some cases they also framed elaborate labyrinths, and the fortified bands may also function as reflections of the Minotaur myth. (Kern, 1981) A distinct possibility exists that these mosaics were mere decorative motifs and acted as functional dividers guiding viewers through houses. (Anon, 1979) These views are undoubtedly valid, and the mosaics likely included a varying mix of these meanings depending on their immediate contexts and commissioners. In the region of Campania, Pompeii alone holds six known examples at the villas of Diomedes and P. Fannius Synistor, and the Houses of the Menander (I.10.4), M. Caesius Blandus (VII.1.40), the Centenary (IX.8.6), and the Wild Boar (VIII.3.8). (Anon, 2005) The depictions range from simple tower or city gate motifs in the House of M. Caesius Blandus to the elaborate wall systems surrounding labyrinths at the Villa of Diomedes. They became particularly popular with the introduction of the Second-Style, placed either in panels or thresholds announcing spaces, or as bands functioning as complete metaphorical fortifications protecting the space. (Anon, n.d.) The similarity and extensive tradition of the type, ranging from the third century BCE to the Flavian period, suggests that they also were decorative motifs widely available in pattern books. (Anon, n.d.) The House of the Menander, for example, preserves a fragmentary Second-Style mosaic panel depicting a fortification lining the impluvium of the atriolum (fig. 109). The panel here fits into a wider patterned repertoire of crenellated-tower patterns, discussed further below, and its isolated context suggests its primary function as a decorative motif. (Anon, n.d.) The examples contained in the villas of Diomedes, and P. Fannius Synistor are either completely lost or in such a fragmentary state as not to merit extensive discussion (fig.110). 771 Suffice it to say that, like the panel in the House of the Menander, they functioned in Second-Style ensembles in luxury dwellings associated with the new colonists. They may therefore have carried further symbolic references with the refurbished fortifications of Pompeii such as romanitas. With these issues in mind, Pompeii also preserves examples that are specific commissions diverging from the typical representations. They have induced 769 See Becatti, Mosaici e pavimenti marmorei, 297-299 and also Lavagne, \"Un embléme de Romanitas: Le motif des tours et ramparts en mosaïque,\" 138-139. 770 The Second-Style panel is heavily damaged but still displays the corner of a city gate and a wall curtain rendered in opus quadratum and capped with an oversized T-shaped merlon. It leads to a tower with a small window. Ling describes it as a single gate flanked by two towers, whereas Iorio rightly identifies a continuation of the enceinte on each side of the tower. This continuation suggests that it derived from band mosaics.

Scholars have consistently described the Poppaei as the gens owning the house. They eventually produced Poppea, the wife of Nero. Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 122. 771 The example in the Villa of Diomedes is preserved only in an early nineteenth century drawing. See L.Barré, Ercolano e Pompei: Raccolta generale de pitture, bronzi, mosaici, vol. 5 (Venice, 1862) fig. 6.4. The drawing shows an elaborate enceinte surrounding a labyrinth with no entry or exit. It dates to anywhere between 80 and 60 BCE. See Kern, Labirinti 25-26, 115 for the date. The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor once contained an early example of a complete band mosaic depicting a fortification running around the entirety of the small peristyle. Today only a fragment survives dated variously to the early Second-Style and the Imperial period. See F.Barnabei, La villa pompeiana di P. Fannio Sinistore scoperta presso Boscoreale (Roma, 1901), 17; Ling et.al The Insula of the Menander at Pompeii: The Decorations 57; Iorio \"La presenza della cinta muraria nei mosaici di Pompei,\" 291. For the identification of the owner see G. Sauron, \"Le propriétaire de la villa dite de P. Fannius Synistor à Boscoreale vers 50 Av. J.C. P.

Blandus, and one refers to him as a centurion of the Praetorian Guard. (Los, 1995) The Caesii were a distinguished colonial family and L. Caesius, a pro-Sullan man enriched by the proscriptions, financed the Forum baths during his tenure as a duovir iure dicundo. (Anon, n.d.) Fiorelli first associated Blandus with the house, and Matteo Della Corte connected him further by describing the distinct martial character of the decorations as reflective of his rank. (Anon, n.d.) He argued that the entrance mosaic referenced his overseas military adventures including a victory over an unknown city acknowledged in the threshold. (Anon, n.d.) This reasoning is in many ways far-fetched and, although the house may have belonged to the Caesii, most of the pavements date to the Second-Style and certainly do not reflect the exploits of Blandus as a Praetorian Guard. (Anon, 1938) A more recent hypothesis builds on the six fragments of the inscription commemorating Loreius and Cuspius as the restorers of the walls. Excavators originally found them re-used in a threshold and the peristyle floor of the house. (Anon, n.d.) Damaged in the earthquake of 62 CE, the theory proposes that the fragments found their way into the house because one of the two duumvirs was an ancestor of its last owner. (Anon, n.d.) The evidence is again somewhat circumstantial, especially if we consider that the inscription ended up in the floors rather than a more prominent position referencing the ancestry of the owner. Yet, if we assume a continuity of ownership, the fauces mosaic may represent a direct commission by one of the duumvirs to further celebrate his euergetism. In any event, all we can really say is that the fauces mosaic reflects the owner's strong identification with the symbols of Pompeii. In this context the fortifications in the threshold likely reference to the newly refurbished city walls as a conceptual expression of the colony and its romanitas. Such an expression is all the more compelling if we accept the Loreii, Cuspii, or Caesii as owners of the house, since all three were strong pro-Sullan gentes supplying duumvirs early in the colony. The House of the Wild Boar (VIII.3.8) preserves a spectacular example of a mosaic with city walls in its atrium (fig. 112). Dating to the early Imperial period, the mosaic spans the entire space with a continuous band depicting city walls framing a motif of intersecting perpendicular \"I\" shaped forms. (Anon, n.d.) The curtain wall features oversized regular ashlar masonry and large T-shaped merlons similar to the mosaic in the House of C. Blandus. Towers appear at regular intervals and on each corner of the rectangular 780 Fiorelli, Giornale degli scavi di Pompei vol. 13-15 (Naples, 1862), 96.

Niccolini renders this mosaic incorrectly with dolphins and other marine life rather than the intersecting I shapes. This serves as a reminder not to accept secondary evidence as implicitly correct. F. Niccolini and F. Niccolini, Le case ed i monumenti di Pompei. vol. 3 (Naples 1890), Pl. 5. referred to the siege and their military exploits. (Anon, n.d.) The theory is rather far-fetched and without further evidence the conclusions remain highly debatable. We do know, however, that the dwelling was a so-called ordo decurionum house lining the via Marina/via (Anon, n.d.)

Another mosaic belonging to the same period once adorned a cubiculum opening onto the main peristyle of the House of the Centenary (fig. 113). (Anon, n.d.)

Scholars first identified it as a Second-Style mosaic due largely to its erroneous attribution to the House of the Silver Wedding. A new evaluation identified it as a rare Third-Style composition dating to the early Augustan era. See also, V. Sampaolo, \"IX 8, 3.7: Casa del Centenario.\" In Pompei: Pitture e mosaici, 9 pt.2 (Rome, 1990), 978-980. The gorgon and fortified scene, both facing the rear of the room, acted as an apotropaic device safeguarding the individuals inside. However, the fortified circuit and its inclusion in the emblema is a motif without known parallels that was probably uniquely associated with the owner. The composition fits into a wider marine decorative theme of the house linking perhaps to the merchant profession of the owner, or as a port metaphor for the safety and refuge offered by the home. (Anon, n.d.) The two panels in the cubiculum likely composed a single scene, and a recent theory suggests that the mosaic might even depict a city particularly dear to the owner, perhaps Alexandria, due to the presence of the lighthouse and the palm tree. (Anon, n.d.) If it indeed represents the Egyptian city, the rendition of the walls and the lighthouse are a remarkable short hand for the large and complex metropolis. Less complex city wall renditions, typical of the Second-Style, involve seriated towers joined with low curtain walls placed in thresholds. The House of Tryptolemus (VII.7.5) contains a prime example of the type with a double band acting as an extended (Anon, n.d.) Coralini, \"I pavimenti della Casa del Centenario a Pompei\" 48, 54-56. The house allegedly belonged to A. Rustius Verus, or Ti. Claudius Verus, in the final years of Pompeii, but the commissioner of the mosaic remains anonymous, Della Corte Case ed abitanti di Pompei, 133. On the Caudii and the Rustii see Castrén, Ordo Populusque Pompeianus,154, 214. 790 Pesando and Guidobaldi, Pompei, Oplontis, Ercolano, Stabiae, 241. threshold to a prominent oecus (fig. 114). The polychrome mosaic features an ingenious reversible design where the merlons of each tower form the crenellations of the opposite low curtain walls and vice-versa, resulting in a line of fortifications on either side. The overall result depicts two lines of walls that clearly announced the limits of the room on each side. (Anon, n.d.) The space was a tablinum of sorts that still contains a prestigious emblema in opus scutulatum, a rarity for this period in Pompeii. Its presence, along with a general refurbishment of the dwelling in the early colony, has led to a recent conclusion this was an ordo-decurionum house, belonging perhaps to one of the founders of the colony. 792 A slightly simpler band runs around the impluvium of the House of Cornelius Rufus (VIII.4.15). Now almost completely destroyed, a few old photographs capture its original layout composed of black and white towers alternating to form two lines; one facing the impluvium and the other the atrium (fig. 115). (Anon, n.d.) On the southern side the band jutted out to envelop the well-head and a large marble table with prominent back to back griffins as leg supports. A herm recovered in the atrium attests that the house belonged to Cornelius Rufus, a member of the Cornelii, the descendants of Sullan clients including P. Cornelius Sulla, one of the founders of the colony. (Anon, n.d.) In practical terms the apotropaic value of these two examples is evident and their regular pattern suggests that they were a common decorative theme. Considering their placement in public areas related to patron-791 I. Bragantini, \"VII 7,5: Casa di Trittolemo.\" In Pompei: Pitture e Mosaici, 7 (Rome, 1990), 232-233. (Anon, n.d.) The emblema was a particularly prestigious collection of marble types, with parallels found only in the in the House of the Faun, the Temple of Apollo and the Temple of Jupiter after its early colonial refurbishment. The House of Tryptolemus is also a prime example of the proscription process as it expanded to include the entire insula strategically located north and west of the Temples of Venus and Apollo, see Pesando, Gli ozi di Ercole: Residenze di lusso a Pompei ed Ercolano, 103-105. Scholars have otherwise, rather precariously, identified L. Calpurnius Diogenes or the Cisonii as the owners of the house. See Della Corte, Case ed abitanti di Pompei, 220. 793 I. Bragantini, \"VIII 4, 15.30: Casa di Cornelius Rufus.\" In Pompei: Pitture e mosaici, 8 (Rome, 1990), 518-520. 794 Castrén, Ordo Populusque Pompeianus, 157; Fiorelli, Descrizione di Pompeii, 340-341. The mosaic is undated due to the loss of the decorative schemes in the house, although much of the atrium receives new Fourth-Style paintings. client rituals however, and the prominence of the families, the mosaics likely also carried associations of romanitas and probably referenced the newly refurbished walls of the city. This brief survey highlights the preponderance of city wall mosaics dating to the late Republican and early Imperial period of the colony. To a certain extent they undoubtedly were part of decorative motifs available to artists; their significance sometimes did not go beyond that. Nevertheless, their boundary defining and protective roles translate naturally from the real enceintes defending the community. The period of their highest popularity broadly coincides with the refurbishment of the fortifications. The connection between the two occurred on multiple levels with the examples in the Pompeian pavements working as apotropaic devices and distinct emblems of the new colony. Furthermore, the mosaics provided a powerful reminder of the relationship between the city walls, the Pompeian elite, and even the political messages of the new empire. The ideals associated with city walls, their status as boundary markers, and their apotropaic and religious values, clearly connected in the domestic and political sphere to help foster the identity of the new city. Moving beyond the mosaics, we return to the amphitheater district and the city walls framing it. The fresco depicting the riot between Pompeian and Nucerian factions offers an impression of the quarter in the years leading up to the earthquake (fig. 116). It is a vivid depiction of Tacitus's narration of the events of 59 CE which left many spectators dead, and ensured an imperial ban on games in the city for a period of ten years. (Anon, n.d.) These events are a testament to the continued importance of the district in the history of the Pompeii. The fresco is an unusual historical document responding directly (Anon, n.d.) Tacitus, Annals XIV.17. to very specific demands of the commissioner. It therefore offers a glimpse of the buildings and the fortifications in the public imagination. The owner was likely involved in the happenings of that day and chose to immortalize and display the event in his peristyle where only selected guests could admire it. 796 However, we should remember that the fresco survives because excavators detached it from the wall and that parts of the composition may be lost and unknown. The fresco displays the arena quarter from a bird's eye perspective, allowing the best view of the action occurring in and around the amphitheater. The artist stressed the recognizable aspects of the building including its prominent stair ramps that even today The reliefs have drawn much scholarly discussion concerning their placement, ownership, and depicted buildings. 800 A similar complex discussion involves the motive for their commission identified as commemorative, votive, or apotropaic. (Anon, n.d.) The reliefs are a clear historical document and as such differ significantly from other more generalized civic images. Their importance lies in the very conceptualization of the disaster with the Temple of Jupiter, and the Porta Vesuvio as monuments defining the city. To a certain extent this should be hardly surprising since the gate was an important landmark in the city and lies within sight of the entrance to the house. In fact, if we follow the theory outlined previously associating the gate with the ancient Porta Campana, we may even speculate that its presence on the lararium is the result of the Caecilii identifying with the campanienses electoral college. (Anon, n.d.) We have no concrete evidence of that, but the house belonged to L. Caecilius Jucundus. He was a wealthy banker and son of L. Caecilius Felix, a freedman of the Caecilii, a family tracing its roots to colonial settlers. (Anon, n.d.) As freedmen they had little direct Roman ancestry, and Lauren Petersen recently points out how the lararium, and the main atrium where it stood, were part of a deliberate decorative design expressly creating an ancestor house to dignify the gens. Here Jucundus attempted to portray himself as more Roman than he actually was and the lararium exalted him further as an exemplary citizen of Pompeii. 804 Jucundus belonged to the wealthy freedmen, a class that often exhibited a strong identification with the status quo that had enabled their social mobility. (Anon, n.d.) Perhaps Aineias the Tactician best 801 Maiuri, L'ultima fase edilizia di Pompei, 17-21 argues for commemorative, I. S. Ryberg, Rites of the State Religion in Roman art (Rome, 1955), 170-171 makes a case for votive, whereas G. Spano, \"Nuove osservazioni intorno ai bassirilievi pompeiani ricordanti il terremoto del 63 d.C.\" In Studi in onore di Riccardo Filangieri (Napoli, 1959),16-19 sees them in an apotropaic function. 802 Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society, 34-45 describes the strength of neighborhood identity in Pompeii and discusses a reformation of the vici under Augustus as part of the new policy of empire. The neighborhood may therefore not be related to the Campanienses, but may have acquired a different name at this stage. 803 Castrén, Ordo Populusque Pompeianus, 120, 145. 804 L. Hackworth Petersen, The Freedman in Roman Art and Art History (New York, 2006),181-182. 805 Castrén, Ordo Populusque Pompeianus, 124. emphasized the concept when he recommended that the most prominent members of a city receive the highest ranking positions in its defense. They would exhibit the most loyalty to the existing status quo since they had the most to lose if the city fell. (Anon, n.d.) The choice of associating the disaster with a collapsing Porta Vesuvio and making it the object of daily prayers in a private lararium speaks volumes about the role fortifications, and more specifically gates, still played in the concept of the city. One of the common themes throughout the history of Pompeii is the religious symbolism associated with its city walls. As discussed in the previous chapters, the topic closely relates to the identity of the inhabitants and how they perceived the fortifications protecting them. In most basic terms the gods protected the city and the citizens protected them by placing their sanctuaries behind the safety of the fortifications. The direct visual association between the fortifications and the gods of the city was a recurrent theme at Pompeii that focused on the Temple of Mefitis Fisica on the southwestern tip of the plateau, and the Temple of Minerva in the Triangular Forum. In this position they fulfilled the Vitruvian prescriptions that the temples of the protective gods should be in eminent places with commanding views of the city. (Anon, n.d.) The Roman period of Pompeii preserves important evidence revealing the depth of the connection between the gods, the city walls, and the image of the city. They suggest a complex relationship that mirrors the delicate balance of appropriation and preservation of the fortifications. Perhaps the most recognizable and direct symbolic connection between the image of Pompeii and its city walls was the manifestation of the Venus Fisica Pompeiana. (Anon, n.d.) Aeneas Tacticus 1.6, 1.7, and 5.1. (Anon, n.d.) Vitruvius 1.7.1 Scholarship has traditionally identified her cult as an overt stamp of the dictator's conquest on the city and the construction of her temple directly onto the city walls as an indelible mark of subjugation and loss of independence. (Wolf, 2002) As evidenced previously, recent discoveries provide a less dramatic view. Cultic traces stretch to the Archaic period and downdate construction of the main sanctuary to the last quarter of the second century BCE, well before the foundation of the colony. The sanctuary featured a central temple enclosed by porticoes on three sides that afforded a visitor spacious views of the countryside and the Bay of Naples (fig. 62). This design resembled the larger sanctuaries in Italy such as Fortuna Primigenia in Palestrina, Hercules in Tivoli, and Jupiter Anxur in Terracina, reflecting Pompeii's will to join the architectural developments of the peninsula. (Wolf, 2009) Recent scholarship also revises the cult of Venus Fisica Pompeiana as an appropriation of the Samnite Mefitis Fisica. (Lejeune, 1964) Her main sanctuary was in the territory of the Hirpini near the sources of the Sarno River in the Asanto Valley. Mefitis was the personification of bad sulfurous air and the appellative Fisica indicates her primary role as an intercessor between the underworld and the heavens. (Sogliano, 1932) She also presided over fertility, initiation rites into adulthood, natural cycles, and agreements (fides), and was associated with grain, water, and the goddess Ceres. The Mamii were her principal known champions inside the city. They were an old and powerful Samnite family who later also included a prominent priestess to the cult of Venus. The transformation of Mefitis occurred with the arrival of the colonists. Her temple received modifications that included a new decorative program and the reduction of the double terrace supporting it into a single platform (fig.118). Although less dramatic than building an entirely new temple, this modification, or completion depending on the point of view, still provided a powerful example of Roman appropriation of both the cult and the city. 812 Venus was also a personal protectress of Augustus and a subsequent refurbishment of the temple in the late Augustan period provided a similar political statement. This phase marked a grand expansion of the sanctuary leading to the further narrowing of the via Marina, and the extensive use of marble to replace the previous tufa. This move is reminiscent of the grand aurea templa, or golden temples such as the Temple of Apollo, built by the emperor to emphasize his pietas in Rome. 813 Venus Pompeiana usually carries a standard set of attributes: a mural crown or diadem, a scepter, an olive or myrtle branch, and an overturned ship's rudder. She is often heavily bejeweled and wears a blue mantle covering a purple chiton, occasionally decorated with stars (fig. 119). 814 Her attributes are similar to those of Cybele and Fortuna, sometimes leading to debates concerning her identification. Her overall iconography is close to that of the Greek Tychai personifying cities, and the rudder 812 Lepone, \"Venus Fisica Pompeiana,\" 163-167. See also Bernabei, Contributi di archeologia vesuviana. Raccolta critica della documentazione III, i culti di Pompei, 46. And see Curti, \"Venere Fisica trionfante ed il porto di Pompeii, 72. M. Wolf, \"Forschungen zur Tempel Architektur Pompejis,\" 269 suggests it was finished under Sulla and this is certainly possible. 813 Jacobelli and Pensabene, \"La decorazione architettonica del Tempio di Venere a Pompei.

See also Clarke Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans, 89. clearly refers to Pompeii as a port city, or perhaps to Fortuna as guider of lives. (Anon, n.d.) We find her depictions in three main contexts: household lararia, public compita, and on the exterior of houses and shops where she either stands alone, or is part of wider representations of the twelve gods. (Anon, n.d.) The most widely recognized depictions survive on the façade of the Shop of the Procession of Cybele (IX.7.1), and the Shop of Verecundus (IX.7.5-7). On the first façade she stands opposite to a procession honoring Cybele and their combined occurrence stresses the role of both goddesses as protectress of the city. Their presence reflects the piety of the store owner who sought their protection for his business. On the Shop of Verecundus, Venus stands in a quadriga pulled by elephants. In a separate register below her stands Verecundus, a cloth maker and owner of the store she protected. (Anon, n.d.) Along with her presence in many public and private shrines, these images attest to her widespread popularity as protectress of the city and its population. The preservation and transformation of the cult poses some interesting questions regarding the social development of the city from the Samnite to the Roman period. The evidence from the walls and gates suggests a similar continuity but not a direct appropriation. We have already proposed that the Porta Stabia, Ercolano, Marina, Nola, and Vesuvio likely carried religious references to Minerva. However, unlike Venus Pompeiana, the references to Minerva are less evident. For example, besides the graffito mentioning PATRVA, the statuette recovered in the fill of the sidewalk at the Porta Stabia remains unidentified (fig. 28). (Devore et al., 2003) A secure identification also is lacking for the fragments Maiuri found near the Porta Ercolano. The scholar associated them with a shrine that was completely demolished along with the Samnite gate, and struggled to securely identify the pieces pointing to Venus and Minerva as possible candidates. (Anon, n.d.) In addition, the frescos of the lararium at the Porta Vesuvio were faded beyond recognition at the time of excavation. (Anon, n.d.) Only the Porta Marina and Nola have provided more secure identifications. The bust above the Porta Nola, albeit heavily damaged, still displays a few long curly locks extending from the base of her helmet that have provided its link to Minerva (fig. 41 and 50). The Porta Marina still includes an overt religious reference in the form of a large niche in its right forward bastion as one enters the city. Apart from a small podium and a rectangular frame, the niche is now largely devoid of embellishments, but white stucco completely covered it at the time of its excavation (fig. 120). (Anon, n.d.) The reports describe the recovery of three large terracotta statue fragments and two smaller pieces of a hand associated with the shrine. (Anon, n.d.) Hermann von Rohden reunited the fragments in a drawing published in 1880, but they subsequently vanished into obscurity and were considered lost. (Eschebach & Müller-Trollius, 1993) As a result of these circumstances, scholars have largely ignored Minerva's connection to the fortifications and any wider associations she might have had with the protection of the city. In the summer of 2010 the insight of the archives director at Pompeii, Dott.ssa Grete Stefani, led to the rediscovery of the Porta Marina Minerva. Although somewhat battered, the pieces unmistakably join into Von Rohden's reconstruction (fig. 121). The figure stands on her left leg in a gentle contrapposto pose with her right hand resting on her hip. She wears a sleeveless chiton, and a chlamys draped over her right shoulder and arm. The head is gone as is almost the entirety of her left side above the knee. Her left foot peeks through the drapery next to a stylized rock. It preserves an attachment that may be the remnant of a shield that once stood next to her leg. The trace of the shield is the only defining attribute that led to her identification with Minerva in her role as protectress of the fortifications. Von Rohden pointed out the exquisite workmanship of the piece and its Hellenistic character. Yet he was unable to date the statue on stylistic grounds because of its heavy damage. Instead, he dated it more broadly to a refurbishment of the gate based on the fact that the niche is an integral part of the masonry and was not cut into it at a later date. (Anon, n.d.) Scholars now consider this part of the gate to be part of a post-colonial refurbishment, but the statue may be a relic of an earlier phase. The statue is badly damaged, but its recovery context suggests that it broke and was put back into place sometime before the eruption. Despite her battered state she continued to stand vigil over the gate, suggesting a strong continuity with her role as protectress of the fortifications. August Mau originally suggested that Minerva protecting the city gates in Pompeii was part of an overt Greek influence on the city and her role as Athena Polias. 824 Von Rohden, Die Terracotten von Pompeji, 44. Phrygian Minerva as a pro-Roman cult originating in Tarentum in the fourth century BCE. (Anon, n.d.) A series of nearby sanctuaries at Stabia, Punta della Campanella and the site known as Località Bottaro, along with regional temples further south at Fratte, Tarentum, and Paestum, signal the importance of the cult. (Anon, n.d.) More importantly, the Athena and Hercules antefixes recovered at Pompeii, Stabia, and Punta della Campanella were fashioned from the same molds, suggesting that the cult was part of an orchestrated political introduction in the region. Scholars have identified the Nucerian league or a renascent Neapolis as financing the sanctuaries outside of Pompeii, motivated either by their new alliance with Rome, or a final assertion of local identity during the Samnite wars. (Anon, n.d.) For the Punta della Campanella Sanctuary, the most important in the bay, this effort may represent a distinct act of appropriation of a previous cult and, therefore, the region. In fact, some scholars consider the earliest sanctuary at the Punta della Campanella as distinctly Greek, tying it 829 S.

(Anon, 1998) The first traces of the sanctuary, however, stretch back into the sixth century BCE. In a brief article, J.P. Morel even goes as far as connecting its foundation, and that of the Temple of Athena at Pompeii, to a Neapolitan attempt to culturally appropriate the southern Bay of Naples. (Morel, 1982) This early connection between the sanctuaries is difficult to trace with any further certainty. Nevertheless, the votive terracotta statuettes recovered in the sanctuaries associated with the Phrygian Minerva, including the temple at Pompeii, display remarkable similarities (fig. 123). The most common example shows a standing Athena wearing a Phrygian helmet; she braces a shield against her left leg, and in her right hand she holds a patera resting on a colonnette. (Anon, 1990) The popularity of the type has led some scholars to identify it as a copy of the cult statue at Punta della Campanella. The other recovered types need not concern us with the exception of a variant recovered at Paestum and Stabia where Minerva rests her right arm on her hip and holds a shield on her left side in a similar fashion to the Porta Marina example (fig. 124). (Anon, n.d.) Although removed and in the Naples museum, a similar variant also appears in a fresco on the façade of the Shop of the Carpenters' procession (VI.7.8-11). The fresco shows carpenters carrying an effigy of Minerva on a bier in honor of her role as protectress of their trade. Only a fragment of the statue is visible, but enough remains to identify the goddess holding a patera in her right hand and a shield resting against her left leg (fig. 125). Scholars hypothesize that these depictions represent actual cult statues. The image on the bier may well reflect the Punta della Campanella or the Temple of Minerva statues, especially if the lowered patera on the statuettes is artistic shorthand for her extended arm. (Anon, n.d.) If anything, these close associations suggest that the Porta Marina statue was part of the wider regional Minerva cult that also protected Pompeii. Rather aptly this Minerva, amongst her traditional roles promoting fertility and artisanship, also protected navigation, a crucial activity for a port city like Pompeii. (Anon, n.d.) The placement of her sanctuary as a visual beacon in the bay and its strong association with the fortifications seems hardly accidental, and perhaps also explains a decline of the cult once the colonists appropriated Venus Pompeiana. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests a distinct continuity of her cult at the gates and walls of the city perhaps due to her wider role as protectress of fortifications. Elsewhere in the Roman world, the colony of Tarragona in modern Spain preserves a relief of Minerva on a defensive tower known as the Torre de San Magín, or Torre de Minerva, dating to the foundation of the colony in the early second century BCE. The material, a local lime-sandstone, and the style suggest that a local artist carved the relief. (Grünhagen, 1976) Only the bottom half survives, but it is enough to identify the figure as Minerva holding a lance and leaning on a shield decorated with a wolf's head (fig. 126). Its placement on the tower is a clear indication of Minerva's role as protectress of fortifications, but it also acted as a projection of romanitas upon the countryside and the city. (Polo, 2003) Another example comes from the Porta Romana at Ostia Antica where a life-size monumental marble sculpture of Minerva still survives. The statue includes her familiar attributes; she holds a shield decorated with a gorgon with her right hand, wears a helmet on her head, and two prominent wings spring from her back (fig. 127). The sculpture functioned as a type of caryatid in a monumental version of the gate built under Domitian, but it perhaps originally belonged to an earlier version built allegedly built by Cicero in the 63 BCE. (Hesberg, 1998) In both phases she performed in her guise as protectress of the city gate. Incidentally, Cicero himself describes Minerva as custos urbis, or the protectress of the city of Rome, and Plutarch recounts how the orator dedicated a statue of her from his own home at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline. (Anon, n.d.) The evidence, scant as it may be, points to a strong continuous presence of Minerva protecting the walls at Pompeii. To some extent the cult is also traceable to the start of the Roman influence in Campania and Pompeii's alliance with Rome. The ruined state of the temple after the earthquake points to a reduced importance of the cult, and the city walls, in addition to some of the gates, were similarly in disrepair and used as a quarry. (Anon, n.d.) Much of the evidence is debatable and perhaps accidental as Athena/Minerva traditionally plays an important role as protectress of city walls. Nevertheless, her vigilance over the city and its gates provided a powerful reference point for Pompeii's inhabitants and the region. The pro-Roman inception of the Phrygian Minerva, however, led to the continuity and the strong association between Minerva and city walls. Looking back, the conclusions we may gather from the evidence show a few consistent factors in the role of fortifications. Chief amongst these is that they played a central role in the determination of the city's identity throughout its history. Their sheer size, scale, and investment made them the largest public monument and a solid marker of the city. As a result, the population actively engaged in shaping and appropriating the structure as a reflection of their own social make-up and political status. In most basic terms the fortifications consistently provided an area of refuge setting a lowest common denominator of security to the population. This factor is most evident in early Pompeii when the fortifications responded to clear basic needs protecting the community: its people, magistrates, religious idols, and sources of sustenance. The placement of the settlement on a high strategic ridge controlling communication routes and overlooking the Sarno valley also projected and legitimized its power. The city walls essentially acted as a monument to territorial claims. The use of local construction materials in particular further strengthened the notion, connecting the fortifications directly to the landscape supporting the community. In addition, the physical proximity between the fortifications and the sanctuaries of the city symbolically strengthened the bond between the religious and martial elements protecting the community. These factors also further legitimized the power of the commissioners of the structures. The use of similar construction materials in both monument types visually stressed these statements: the walls acted as proud markers of independence to the population and those approaching by land or sea. These powerful elements also resonated throughout the settlement finding a direct correlation between the enceinte, the buildings it enclosed, the landscape, and the people it protected. These were critical elements to basic survival and translated into a distinct symbolic role for the defenses that helped define the image of the city throughout its history. The degree to which the enceinte could forge a sense of security relates to its real and perceived effectiveness to neutralize the threat of war and the dangers of the The basic notions of protection, achievement, and independence were powerful concepts that translated into the enceinte as a stage for the community they enclosed. They were a monument to the social structure that built them. The figures behind their construction manipulated and appropriated these messages as a legitimization of their own power and ambition. As a result their resonance with the urban framework is far from coincidental. From their earliest inception they established an architectural dialogue with the city clearly indicated in the aesthetic considerations at play beyond their purely military design. The most emphatic statements reside in the rusticated masonry socle and the use of limestone and tufa throughout the defenses. These are not subtle embellishments but massive statements of power, all the more evident in the implicit correlation between the appearance of elite housing, manicured avenues such as the via dell'Abbondanza, public buildings, and the city walls. Although the periodization remains somewhat unclear, the employment of such materials echoed the wealth and ambitions of the community. As a result, the fortifications mirrored the status quo and their role to preserve it from both internal and external threats. These factors also explain the acts of private euergetism on the city walls as a direct reflection of the elite's status as the patrons of civic order. The deliberate aesthetic juxtaposition of limestone and tufa may therefore constitute a single conceptual design or a symbolic act of appropriation Figure 7 The Oscan inscription at the Porta Stabia.

Interestingly, his excavations in the house uncovered a rough stucco coating on the blocks set in the foundation trench of the two interior rooms. Maiuri uses this as further proof that the blocks clearly originated from another building. He does not elaborate further, but the discovery indirectly implies that the original orthostate wall included a stucco decoration. However, the blocks may also come from other buildings.

Welch, The Roman Amphitheatre: From its Origins to the Colosseum (Cambridge; New York, 2009), 88-100 This was a direct result of the Marian reforms. These included recruiting a standing professional army from the poorest Roman citizens and equipping them at the state's expense. The state also paid for their training using gladiator trainers. Prior to this the traditional recruit paid his way into the army on a seasonal basis. See Goldsworthy, In the Name ofRome,[136][137][138][139][140] Guzzo, Pompei. Storia e paesaggi della città antica,(Devore & Ellis, 2008)(Seiler et al., 2005) A. Maiuri, \"Pompei.

The large backdoor, however, is reminiscent of Tower IX. The artist perhaps took this building as inspiration because this stretch of wall is also without the agger. Here I agree withMaiuri's assessment, A. Maiuri, L'ultima fase edilizia di Pompei (Spoleto, 1942),17- 21. Although his assessment that the cart and the altar represent an offering for the survival of Jucundus's pack animals seems a little far-fetched. See V. Huet, \"Le laraire de L. Caecilius Jucundus: Un relief hors norme?\" In Contributi di archeologia vesuviana. Raccolta critica della documentazione III, i culti di Pompeii, edited by L.Bernabei (Naples, 2007), 142-150 for a summary of the various theories.",

    "abstract": "A traveller to the battlefields of the Anglo-Zulu War in Northern KwaZulu-Natal will come across, at Isandlwana, a memorial to the Natal Carbineers, an infantry regiment that served on the side of the British during the war. 2",
    "full_text": "The memorial is situated on the site where the Carbineers made their last stand in the Battle of Isandlwana, as well as where Lieutenant Colonel Durnford, commander of the No. 2 Column and one of the most experienced officers in the battle, is said to have fallen. Alongside the article a poem was included, composed in Latin and accompanied by an English translation by the poet, styled simply by his or her initials C. D., entitled: \"IN REDITUM VOLUNTARIORUM MILITUM CARMEN ALCAICUM\" in Latin and \"An Alcaic Ode on the Return of the Volunteers\" in English. (Anon, n.d.) This poem is composed in Alcaic metre supposedly invented by the Greek lyric poet Alcaeus of Mytilene, as the title suggests. The accompanying English translation of the Latin poem is a somewhat free translation of the Latin, but is perhaps rendered in this fashion to preserve its poetic metre. In the poem the end of the war is celebrated, as is the return of husbands, brothers and sons from the war as well as the bravery and valour which the Natal Carbineers were said to have demonstrated on the battlefield at Isandlwana. In the poem, a traveller passing by is addressed and asked to remember the sacrifice made by these men for their country during the war. Reading both of these poems begs the question: why did those commemorating the dead at the Battle of Isandlwana in 1879 choose to compare them to those who died at Thermopylae over two thousand years before? Since Homer's Iliad, war and poetry have shared a fraternal bond. Poetry often is used to express public, and private, sentiment during and after wartime. One of the most employed genres of poetry during wartime is the epitaph. This genre is, as Anne Carson (1999:73) rightly affirms, a genre of verse that profoundly concerns itself with \"seeing what is not there\" and it attempts to \"insert a dead and vanished past into the living present\". (Anon, n.d.) She also notes that, since at least from Homer onwards, an epitaph has been used as a way to alert someone passing by to stop and remark on it (Carson 1999:73). (Anon, n.d.) The Greco-Persian Wars of the 5 th Century BC also inspired many epitaphs, like other wars, and provided for Simonides, the \"unofficial poet\" of these wars, a subject for numerous lines of his poetry. (Anon, n.d.) Simonides was the most prolific composer of epitaphs in antiquity and in fact set the conventions of the genre (Carson 1999:73). He is attested to have composed poems or epigrams for all of the major battles of the Greco-Persian Wars: Plataea, Artemisium and Salamis. 9 It is his poems for Thermopylae, however, that won him the most fame in the minds of the West and perhaps more importantly won immediate fame for the Spartan dead. Herodotus records three epigrams, which he attributes to Simonides, for the dead at 5 This poem is reproduced in full in the Appendix. Presumably what Carson means by \"seeing what is not there\" is the fact that the epitaph stands, usually, in the place of the fallen, or the battle, and so allows the reader to \"see\" the battle, or fallen soldiers who were in the very same place previously by reading the poem. 7 Also see Iliad 7.81-91. 8 Simonides as a professional poet composed numerous poems for cities, athletes and rulers. While composing poems for the Persian Wars, it is not clear which were, if any, specifically commissioned. 9 For Plataea, see POxy 3965; see also Boedeker 1996:223-242. There are two possible poems ascribed to Simonides for the Battle of Artemisium see Podlecki 1968:262-266. For the Battle of Salamis, see Fr. 65 D quoted in Plutarch's de malignitate Herodoti. Thermopylae. (Anon, n.d.) The first epigram was composed for all the Greeks who fell at Thermopylae; it reads: Muri£sin pot t´de triakos…aij ™m£conto ™k Peloponn£sou cili£dej tštorej. Four thousand from the Peloponnese once here fought Against three hundred myriads. Secondly, one specifically for the Spartans, quoted previously, and thirdly and finally, one for the seer Megistias, which reads as follows: MnÁma tÒde kleino‹o Megist…a, Ón pote MÁdoi SperceiÕn potamÕn kte‹nan ¢meiy£menoi, m£ntioj, Öj tÒte KÁraj ™percomšnaj s£fa e\"dëj oÙk oetlh Sp£rthj ¹gemÒna prolipe‹n. Here is a memorial of famous Megistias, whom once the Medes Killed, having crossed the Spercheius river, A seer, who, knowing plainly that his doom was approaching, Did not dare to desert the leader of the Spartans. Collectively these poems celebrate the loyalty, bravery and obedience that the Greeks demonstrated at the Battle of Thermopylae. However, it is Simonides' epigram for the Spartan dead in particular that has received the most attention by scholars and writers alike, becoming the epigram par excellence of the genre and has been described as demonstrating \"edle Einfalt und stille Größe\". 11 It is therefore no surprise that it was this epigram in particular, apart from the rest, which was used in commemorating the British and their dead at the Battle of Isandlwana. Apart from these epigrams recorded by Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus also records an encomium, which he states Simonides wrote in praise of the Spartans' valour at Thermopylae.foot_1 10 Hdt. 7.228. For a discussion on whether all three epigrams are the work of Simonides or only the final one concerning Megistias, see Podlecki 1968:257-275. For the purposes of this article I have assumed single authorship. 11 Kytzler 2004:325 \"noble simplicity and quiet greatness\". Writers as varied as Cicero in antiquity, the German polymath Friedrich Schiller as well as more modern writers like Heinrich Böll and William Golding have all appropriated Simonides' epigram. Adolf Hitler himself appropriated the epigram into a German context. In Mein Kampf (1925) Hitler appeals to the Spartans' valour at Thermopylae in comparing them to the Germans who fought in the Great War. He writes: \"Traveller, when you come to Germany, / Tell the Homeland that we lie here, true to / the Fatherland and faithful to our duty\". Even in recent years, popular fiction writer Steven Pressfield has also adapted the epigram in his 1999 novel, Gates of Fire, as has Frank Miller in his 1998/9 graphic novel 300. The poem reads as follows: tîn ™n QermopÚlaij qanÒntwn eÙkle¾j mn ¡ tÚca, kalÕj d' Ð pÒtmoj, bwmÕj d' Ð t£foj, prÕ gÒwn d mn©stij, Ð d' otoj oepainoj. ™nt£fion d toioàton oÜt' eÙrëj oÜq' Ð pandam£twr ¢maurèsei crÒnoj ¢ndrîn ¢gaqîn.

Of those who perished at Thermopylae All glorious is the fortune, fair the doom; Their grave's an altar, ceaseless memory's theirs Instead of lamentation, and their fate Is chant of praise. Such winding-sheet as this Nor mould nor all-consuming time shall waste. The sepulchre of valiant men has taken The fair renown of Hellas for its inmate. And witness is Leonidas, once king Of Sparta, who hath left behind a crown Of valour mighty and undying fame. Diodorus interprets their stand at Thermopylae as an act of extreme self-sacrifice, having given up their own lives for the common salvation of the Greeks. (Anon, n.d.) Aided by this outpouring of poetry, one could easily conclude with Burn (1984:420-421) that the legend of Thermopylae was \"not slow to be born\". Simonides and his fellow Greeks, Herodotus and Diodorus, were not the only ones in antiquity to fuel the flames of the legend of Thermopylae. Similarly the Romans too, looked back to Thermopylae as an exemplum of courage and bravery. Aulus Gellius in his Noctes Atticae records that Cato the Elder in his work Origins, which we now possess only in fragments, made one of the earliest comparisons of a battle subsequent to the one at Thermopylae. He compares Leonidas and his three hundred Spartans to the Roman military tribune Caedicius and four hundred of his men. During the first Punic War, seeing that the Carthaginian general had advanced to a superior strategic point, and thus had exposed the Roman soldiers to attack, Caedicius approached the consul and offered himself and his four hundred men to advance against the enemy with the outcome of being slaughtered, but in so doing enabled the rest of the Roman army to move to a position of safety. According to Cato, all four hundred men fell except Caedicius, who although being severely wounded was recovered to safety by his fellow soldiers. According to Aulus Gellius, Cato made the comment that, unlike his Greek counterpart Leonidas, Caedicius received little glory for his deeds. He states that: Leonidas Laco, qui simile apud Thermopylas fecit, propter eius virtutes omnis Graecia gloriam atque gratiam praecipuam claritudinis inclitissimae decoravere monumentis: signis, statius, elogiis, histories, aliisque rebus gratissimum id eius factum habuere; at tribuno militum parva laus pro factis relicta, qui idem fecerat atque rem serverat. The Laconian Leonidas, who performed a like exploit at Thermopylae, because of his valour won unexampled glory and gratitude from all Greece, and was honoured with memorials of the highest distinction; they showed their appreciation of that deed of his by pictures, statues and honourary inscriptions, in their histories, and in other ways; but the tribune of the soldiers, who had done the same thing and saved an army, gained small glory for his deeds. (Anon, n.d.) Thus the British appropriation of Thermopylae and Simonides' epigram is not without precedents. In fact the Battle of Thermopylae has been \"misappropriated\" as recently as the Second World War, when Hermann Göring used the battle as a comparable model of the Nazi's battle for Stalingrad. (Anon, n.d.) A crucial fact that must also be kept in mind with regard to the use of Thermopylae as a model for those in the British colony during this period is the influence of Greece and Rome on Victorian Britain. The influence of the classical tradition on the Victorian era has been clearly demonstrated by scholars such as Norman Vance (2007:87-100). Vance has established the heritage of Greece and Rome on all areas of Victorian life; from politics and religion to even things as banal as the steam engine. One may surmise then that this influence was felt even in Britain's colonies. In fact, not only did the classical world in general influence this period, but Ian Macgregor-Morris argues, convincingly, that the second half of the 18 th century and the first half of the 19 th can be understood as the \"Age of Leonidas\" in Britain in particular, stating that it was during this period that \"Leonidas and Thermopylae served as moral ideals [and] were seen to epitomise the often vaguely defined virtues of patriotism and liberty, virtues that were to play such a crucial role in the thought and politics of the period\" (Macgregor-Morris 2000:11). And he goes on to state that, \"at a time when the classical tradition was reaching its height in the public consciousness, Leonidas and Thermopylae represented the very qualities for which antiquity, and ancient Greece in particular, were being venerated\" (Macgregor- Morris 2000:11). (Anon, n.d.) This provides perhaps one more motive for turning to Thermopylae as an exemplum for the Battle at Isandlwana. Closer reflection, however, on the appropriation of the Battle of 14 Aul. Gell. NA 3.7, trans. Rolfe 1961. 15 See Kytzler 2004:328-329 & Hardwick 2003:1 for the relevance of this comparison in view of its context. In fact, other Classical references are also to be found in Anglo-Zulu War poetry. For example: H. B. Worth calls upon Melpomene, the muse of tragedy, to aid him in his poetical composition in Victoria Aut Gloria, and in another anonymous stanza, Virgil is referred to: The youths that Virgil celebrates, / And makes immortal by his song , / Did not much braver things than these … Both of the texts of these poems are quoted in Verdonck 2006:93-108. Thermopylae as well as Simonides' epigram by the British in commemorating their own dead at Isandlwana proves to be problematic. At Thermopylae a small Greek force, comprising of Thebans, Thespians and Spartans and led by Leonidas, the Spartan king, were willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good of Greece. They fought in defence of their land against the expansionist Persian Empire and with the desire to live free from the tyrannical rule of the Great King. These Greeks held off the Persian king, Xerxes, and his far larger army for two days at the pass of Thermopylae, until finally being betrayed on the third day by Ephialtes and being overcome. All died except a few Thebans, who are said to have surrendered. It is one of the key encounters between the Persians and the Greeks in the Persian Wars, and yet unlike the battles of Marathon, Salamis and Plataea, Thermopylae was a defeat for the Greeks. Like Thermopylae, historians of the Battle of Isandlwana also remain undecided on the actual events of the battle, with many of the sources offering differing accounts. (Anon, n.d.) The basic account of events is as follows: on the 11 th of January 1879 British troops under the command of Lord Chelmsford entered Zululand to enforce an ultimatum made by Sir Bartle Frere in the previous month. This ultimatum had demanded the payment of fines, surrender of certain Zulu men to colonial authorities and, most importantly, the abolition of the Zulu military system. It was only a few days later, on the 22 nd of January, that these troops who had entered Zululand with high hopes of imperialist expansion, received a severe blow when their soldiers stationed at Isandlwana were thoroughly defeated at the hands of the Zulus. This Battle at Isandlwana proved to be a blemish on the \"glory\" of the British Empire. One similarity between the Greeks at Thermopylae and the British troops at Isandlwana was that they were both far outnumbered by their opponents who had far larger forces. But unlike Thermopylae, the British at Isandlwana had no natural geographical features that would aid their smaller numbers. Despite not having a narrow pass to manipulate to their advantage, the British did manage to back themselves up against the hill of Isandlwana, to prevent attack from the rear. What we can know for certain is that like the Greeks at Thermopylae, it was a defeat for the British and a decisive victory for the Zulus, unlike the other battles of the Anglo-Zulu war such as Rorke's Drift and Ulundi, in which the British demonstrated superior tactical skills and armament. (Anon, n.d.) But conversely to Thermopylae, it was the British fighting at Isandlwana who were the aggressors with imperialistic aims and instead it is the Zulus who fought to defend their freedom against the territory-grabbing British. A comparison between the Zulus and the Spartans in terms of their similarities as martial societies has been undertaken before; this comparison, however, is not in relation to the Battle of Thermopylae. (Anon, n.d.) However, if this comparison was extended to Isandlwana and Thermopylae, it would be a logical result to match the Zulus with the Spartans and make the British 17 See Morris 1965, Guy 1979 and Lock 2002. There is a dearth in literature (whether in English or Zulu) on the Anglo-Zulu War from a \"Zulu perspective\". See Cope 1981:41-50 for an explanation of this, and for a general survey of literature on the war up to 1980. synonymous with the Persians. This brief description of the antagonists and defenders at both Thermopylae and Isandlwana hopefully demonstrates the problematic nature of this appropriation. It must be noted that apart from the Battle at Isandlwana, the battle at Rorke's Drift, another major conflict during the Anglo-Zulu War, which occurred on the same day as the Battle of Isandlwana, approximately 10 kilometres west of Isandlwana, across the Buffalo River, has also been likened to Thermopylae in poetry. In another poem printed in the Cape Times on the 20 th of February 1879, an unnamed poet wrote: For in that little fortress Five score at most held out, While twice two thousand Zulus Raised high their battle shout. 'Twas but a hundred heroes -Leonidas had three -Yet have they made of that stockade A new Thermopylae! Unlike the Battle of Isandlwana, the Battle of Rorke's Drift was a victory for the British and thus immediately a comparison with Thermopylae breaks down. It did however demonstrate the British troops' ability to hold out against a much larger force in a similar manner to those Greeks at the Anopaean path. Therefore the motif of \"few against many\" is appropriate to the comparison. At the mission station by Rorke's Drift, 139 British troops successfully defended themselves against a mass of some 4000 Zulu warriors. Due to large casualties, the Zulus began withdrawing after midnight, ending their attack completely sometime after 4 a.m. The battle was celebrated as a victory by the British and the Victoria Cross, which is the highest military decoration awarded to British forces for valour in warfare, was awarded to eleven of the men who took part in the defence at Rorke's Drift. Another longer poem also purporting to compare Rorke's Drift to Thermopylae appeared in Britain in March of 1879. The poem in fact compares the Battle of Isandlwana to Thermopylae. Presumably because both battles were fought on the very same day and conflicting news reports were circulated, the poet confused the two battles. Written by Albert H. Bencke, the poem's title: Thermopylae BC 480. Rorke's Drift, Natal AD 1879 as well as its subtitle: \"An Historical Parallel\", immediately signals to the reader the intended comparison. In his preface to the poem, Bencke states his intentions: The following lines were written on the first arrival of the news of destruction of a wing of the 24 th Regiment, when such expression as \"disgraceful defeat\", \"tarnished honour\", \"humiliating disaster\", were used by certain journals with most unseemly freedom. It was to combat these expressions that these lines were written. http://akroterion.journals.ac.za The poem is divided into two shorter poems, one on the Battle of Thermopylae consisting of eight quatrains and the second focusing on the events of the day of both battles: Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift. This poem, although originally nine stanzas also of four lines each, was altered by Bencke, who replaced stanza VII with two other quatrains. The first poem recalls that the \"brave and free\" Greeks under Leonidas held the pass at Thermopylae against the Persians. The size of the opposing forces is alluded to, with the Greeks being described as \"the little band of heroes\" and the Persians simply as \"the mighty host\" or again, \"the mighty foe\". The Greeks' unwillingness to flee from the battle, but rather to stay and fight until death is also recalled: Nought remains except to die; / Yet the little band of heroes / One and all disdain to fly. Stanza VI reports the positivist views held by most of the Battle of Thermopylae: Scanty is the Persian triumph, / Though, indeed, they win the pass … Despite the Persian victory at Thermopylae, post-battle propaganda viewed the defeat as a sort of victory, or at very least a spur for the Greeks onto later victory at Salamis. 20 This is also pointed out by Bencke in the poem: Nor in vain was great example, / As the Persians found, I wis, / When it taught the Grecian people / How to win at Salamis. The final stanza of the \"Thermopylae poem\" demonstrates something of the mirage created for Sparta because of the Battle of Thermopylae, it reads: Many a fight have won the Spartans, / Battles great, by land and sea, / But their Maidens' boast was ever / How was lost Thermopylae. The juxtaposition of \"won\" in the first line with \"lost\" in the last poignantly illustrates Thermopylae's importance in Sparta's military history. Despite the title of the second poem: \"Rorke's Drift AD 1879\" the majority of the poem is spent reflecting on the defeat suffered by the British at the hands of the Zulus at Isandlwana. It begins by referring to the \"woeful sad disaster\" that the Battle of Isandlwana turned out to be for the British. The weather (\"On a gloomy winter's evening\") in Britain reflects the mood that the public must have felt upon hearing of the defeat. The implications of shame and honour that the defeat caused for the soldiers and the country are then appealed to in stanza II. Again, like in the \"Thermopylae poem\" the size of each of the armies is noted (\"Twenty thousand savage foemen\") and the Zulus are described to be, despite being \"savage\", trained and armed with European skill and weapon. (Anon, n.d.) Bencke aims to stress the point that only because of the \"civilizing\" aspect of European culture are these \"barbarians\" 20 Perhaps the English idiom \"You may have won the battle, but you will not win the war\" is most appropriate. The fact that the Zulus had large quantities of European firearms is attested to by historians of the Anglo-Zulu War, but that they were trained to use them is another matter. Greaves 2002:67 notes: \"By the time of the British invasion the Zulu army possessed firearms in large numbers … but most Zulus were untrained and highly inaccurate …\" able to win the battle. In stanza V, Bencke appeals to his reader to forbear their cry of \"Shame\" until they have heard of the noble stand made by the few troops at Rorke's Drift. Much is made in the poem of the loss of \"colours\" of the Queen's 24 th Regiment of Foot. This anecdote from the final stages of the Battle of Isandlwana has proved popular in subsequent retellings of the battle. The details are as follows: Lieutenants Melville and Coghill, mounted officers of the 24 th Regiment, in an attempt to save the Queen's Colours from the Zulus, escaped from the camp and made a heroic ride of about 5 miles to the Buffalo River. Both were able to cross the river but on the Natal bank were killed by the local Zulus. During the river crossing, with the river being in flood, the flag was inadvertently lost down the river, uncaptured by the Zulus, on whom the significance of capturing the colours was lost. They were subsequently retrieved after the battle, after which they were returned to Britain and now reside, displayed in Brecon Cathedral in Wales. Bencke's initial manuscript seems to have been written prior to the recovery of the flag. In his unedited text, he acknowledges that Lieutenants Melville and Coghill lost the Queen's Colour. However in the emended stanzas he writes: Rumour said they lost the colours, / Gold inwrought with fame of old, / But t'was false, alone there failed / Hands the colours to uphold. He acknowledges the two soldiers' deaths in attempting to save the flag: E'en in death they yet preserved them, / Twain they died the flag to save. Stanza eight provides the now well-worn motive for the soldiers' \"heroic\" deaths: Death they could not but foreknow / Yet to save their country's honour / Died, their faces to the foe. Like at Thermopylae the soldiers resigned themselves to their impending deaths for honour's sake. The final stanza of the poem questions the notions of honour and shame in this battle, most probably in opposition to contemporary journalists' reports, and it appeals to the immortal glory that the soldiers have won for themselves by dying on their country's behalf: Yea so long as time may be / Purest glory shall illumine / \"Twenty-fourth's\" Thermopylae! The poem attempts to salvage the reputation of the British soldiers' conduct at the Battle of Isandlwana. By appealing to the epic stand at Rorke's Drift after the defeat at Isandlwana, the public's attention was focused away from the shame of the defeat and onto the honour of the victory, no matter how small it was. Greaves (2002:178) rightly concludes: \"an inglorious defeat could be offset by a glorious victory\". The Battle of Thermopylae, Cartledge (2004:171) argues, was subsequently used by the Greeks as a \"morale victory\". And as Peter Green (1996:145) has argued, the defeat at Thermopylae in fact spurred Greece on to victory at the Battles of Salamis and Plataea. So in a similar way, the shame that the defeat at Isandlwana caused for the British, spurred them on to their ultimate victory at the last major battle of the Anglo-Zulu war: the Battle of Ulundi on the 4 th of July 1879. Jeff Guy (1979:53-54) writes of the British responses to Isandlwana: \"there was no debate over the fact that the Zulu had to be punished for daring to defend their independence so effectively\". The only other similarity between the two groups of soldiers is that they both fought in obedience to their orders, the Spartans to their laws and the British under Chelmsford's command. The British forces' sentiment towards the war at Isandlwana is perhaps akin to those of the Spartans at Thermopylae. For, judging by the tone of these poems, the British forces viewed fighting and dying for one's country as something noble. Lines in the inscription like the ones that state: \"Falling To Dye The Earth / With Brave Men's Blood\" glamourises men who die in battle on behalf of their country as brave. And again, so too do the following lines of the poem printed in the Natal Witness: Contemnit audax. Duxit in ardua Virtus repulsae nescia vel fugae, Lauroque ditavit future, Heu nimium juvenes fideles! Inter profundae laetitiae sonos, Sunt quas amarus flere iubet dolor, Optata non illas salutant Oscula, nec tenerae loqulae. But that man fears dishonour more than death, Whom freedom nurtures with sure trust in God; He goes unflinching through opposing troops, And blenches not at war's uplifted rod, Brave because true. So our too trustful lads, Valour, which knows not how to cringe or fly, Beckoned right on to danger and to fame, And left them all to suffer, some to die. Or again: Hinc homines procul Cedant profane. Sistite paullulum, Vos o viatores! Honore Ne careant patriae sepulcra. Nam sempiterna est gloria; posteris, Quum nostra dudum praeteriit dies, Narrabit Isandlwana nomen, Nobilium facinus viorum. … Let no rude step profane These sacred precincts. Traveller, pause awhile; They who lie here died for their country's sake, Their memory shall enjoy their country's smile. Self-sacrifice ne'er dies. And still when down The stream of time our record disappears, Will Isandlwana to our sons proclaim The noble exploits of our Carbineers. These lines excerpted from the longer poem are addressed, like Simonides' epigram, to a traveller who would pass by the place where the fallen soldiers lie, and they express attitudes to war and death that would have been all too familiar in Spartan society. The tone of the poem is often exultant, despite acknowledging the defeat that the battle was. Praise is assigned to those who died, not for their victory in battle, but rather for the way they conducted themselves in defeat and for going to their deaths bravely. Despite the optimistic tone of the poem, however, the following lines acknowledge and mourn the losses felt on the side of the British. However, these losses are used to assign even more glory to the self-sacrifice the soldiers made on behalf of their country: Inter profundae laetitiae sonos, Sunt quas amarus flere jubet dolor, Optata non illas salutant Oscula, nec tenerae loqulae. Forget not how amidst yon notes of joy, Bleeds many a woman's silent aching heart, Whose lips no more one other's lips may meet, Nor to his ear love's tender words impart. In discussing the poetry of often anonymous poets, on the periphery of the Victorian canon, who sought to commemorate the battles of Anglo-Zulu War in their verse, Verdonck (2006:98) states: In adopting the idiom and the structure, then, both rhetorical and metaphorical, generally associated with the auctoritas of Greco-Roman antiquity and the chivalric fantasia of medieval times, these poems mean to position themselves (as minstrels, the medium of heroism) and the heroes of which they sing the praise (the very currency of these ancient narratives) on a historical continuum which works at bringing together the British empire and the mythical dominion of a past that is univocally perceived as heroic and venerable. In other words, these poets are doing their very best to place the \"heroes\" and battles that they write about in a long and established tradition of glory and praise. The atmosphere that these poems create, and the language -often ornate, archaic and grandiloquent -within which this atmosphere is couched, creates a heroic credibility to the dismal outcome of events at Isandlwana for example, and justifies the very presence of the British in Natal and Zululand. In effect, as Verdonck (2006:98) rightly concludes: \"These poems, in short, want poetry, not history, in the Aristotelian sense\". Similar to the sentiments expressed by the British are the well-known laconic sayings such as the one attributed to a Spartan woman and mother, by Plutarch, in which the Spartan mother after having given her son a shield encourages him to either return with it or on it. (Anon, n.d.) The mother expects her child to either return victorious to Sparta, or if not, to have died in combat. In a similar way to Plutarch, Herodotus also illustrates these shared sentiments and attitudes by relaying the story of Aristodemus, one of the three hundred who escaped death on account of his blindness. Unlike a fellow-Spartan, Eurytus, who was also suffering with ophthalmia, but rejoined the three hundred to die by their sides, Aristodemus returned to Sparta, where, Herodotus tells us, he was disgraced and dishonoured. No Spartan gave him fire, or spoke to him except to label him a coward. (Anon, n.d.) In a similar story Herodotus tells of one Pantites, who by carrying a message to Thessaly, also did not die with Leonidas and his three hundred men. (Anon, n.d.) In shame, however, he committed suicide upon his return to Sparta. Xenophon traces the origins of this shame and honour culture to Sparta's legendary law-giver Lycurgus, stating that \"Axion d toà LukoÚrgou kaˆ tÒde ¢gasqÁnai, tÕ katerg£sasqai ™n tÍ pÒlei aƒretèteron enai tÕn kalÕn q£naton ¢ntˆ toà a\"scroà b…ou. He caused his people to choose an honourable death in preference to a disgraceful life. (Anon, n.d.) The passage goes on to illustrate how Lycurgus achieved this feat: ™ke‹noj to…nun safîj pareskeÚase to‹j mn ¢gaqo‹j eÙdaimon…an, to‹j d kako‹j kakodaimon…an. ™n mn g¦r ta‹j ¥llaij pÒlesin, ÐpÒtan tij kakÕj gšnhtai, ™p…klhsin mÒnon oecei kakÕj enai, ¢gor£zei d ™n tù aÙtù Ð kakÕj t¢gaqù kaˆ k£qhtai kaˆ gumn£zetai, ™¦n boÚlhtai• ™n d tÍ Lakeda…moni p©j mn ¥n tij a\"scunqe…h tÕn kakÕn sÚskhnon paralabe‹n, p©j d' ¨n ™n pala…smati suggumnast»n. Clearly, what he did was to ensure that the brave should have happiness, and the coward misery. For in other states when a man proves a coward, the only consequence is that he is called a coward. He goes to the same market as the brave man, sits beside him, attends the same gymnasium, if he chooses. But in Lacedamon everyone would be ashamed to have a coward with him at the mess or to be matched with him in a wrestling bout. In summation then, Spartans were bound to their honour, which depended to a large degree on how the fellow-members of their society perceived them. The Victorian British were by no means a shame and honour society to the same extreme as that of the Spartan one, but in a similar way did place huge importance on an individual's standing in society, and so too in a similar way believed that death for the sake of one's country was a noble thing. (Anon, n.d.) The Chief Justice, Sir Henry Connor, is reported in the Natal Witness on the 9 th of August 1879 as insisting that to die fighting for England at Isandlwana was \"as they knew from the days of their Latin Grammar, an honourable and a beautiful thing\". (Anon, n.d.) And in the same vein, Sir Henry Bulwer, the Governor of Natal, is reported as saying: We rejoice to know that when the danger of that fierce death came suddenly upon them, our men faced it bravely, and that they gave up their young lives gallantly and nobly, and that their death was a soldier's death, a death honourable to all men … [and] that they have done their duty right-well, and that they have worthily upheld the reputation of this Colony. (Anon, n.d.) These similarities, then, that remain between the Greeks fighting at the Battle of Thermopylae, and the British in the battles of the Anglo-Zulu War, particularly Isandlwana, are shown in the views held by each side with regard to war and death experienced in battle in the service of one's country. The differences between them, however, are numerous, and we must therefore conclude that the battles of the Anglo-Zulu War definitely do not present an African Thermopylae. This ideal was heavily criticized by another \"war poet\", Wilfred Owen in his poem on the First World War: Dulce et Decorum est published posthumously in 1920. In this poem, quoting wellknown lines from Horace's Odes 3.3.13, Owen states that, if seeing the horrors of war, and in his case the trench warfare of the First World War, then a person would not tell a child the \"old lie\" that dying for one's country is fitting and sweet. http://akroterion.journals.ac.za Diod.

Un percorso ispirato ad una forma di sacralità antica quanto interiore, vagando per luci, aedicolae, aedes. Il \"Bosco del Frutteto\", realizzato nell'inverno 2022-2023, ha previsto la messa a dimora di circa 3.000 piante tra alberi da bosco e da frutto. Come per i vigneti di Pompei, oggetto di una pro-7 cedura simile, anche per la gestione dei terreni agricoli e di nuovi orti didattici, si è adottata la formula del partenariato pubblico-privato con un avviso di manifestazione di interesse pubblicato nel settembre 2023 e che condurrà ad individuare un partner economico, scientifico e sociale che possa garantire, in stretta connessione con l'Area Cura del Verde del Parco archeologico di Pompei, l'adozione delle migliori buone pratiche di gestione dei terreni secondo i dettami della coltivazione biologica e dell'adozione delle pratiche in uso nell'antichità.

Excavations at Pompeii I 14, Season One (2022): A Brief Report INTRODUCTION The Pompeii I.14 project is a collaboration led by Tulane University and the Parco Archeologico di Pompeii, including as key contributors Oxford University, Princeton University, Carleton College, and the Geospatial and Virtual Archaeology Laboratory and Studio of Indiana State University 1. Through stratigraphic excavation in the (once united) properties I 14, 1/11-13 and I 14, 14, we aim not only to illuminate the development of this area of Region I, but also to answer key questions on Roman urbanism, related particularly to sub-elite experience, urban infrastructure, and the functioning of cities beyond their formal boundaries. Our first season of field excavation in the summer of 2022 focused on Property I 14, 1/11-13 (fig. 1) 2 .This building was cleared partially during Maiuri's work south of the via dell'Abbondanza in the 1950s and fully revealed in the 1990s 3 . Although it has been considered a house at the time of the eruption in 79 CE, its final arrangement includes few standard markers of domestic space. Instead, it featured an unusual arrangement of at least nine interior dining rooms of various sizes and a garden on two levels that included a large masonry triclinium (fig. 2). The arrangement suggests not a house but a restaurant, with any domestic function secondary to that use. Two large shops incorporated into the facade (at Entrances I 14, 11 and I 14, 13) completed the commercial suite, while a staircase off a central corridor offered access to a second story that possibly included living space above 4 . The complex appears to have operated together with two neighboring buildings: a bar at the southeastern corner of the block (I 14, 15) and a smaller building next door, which included a large kitchen (Anon, n.d.). While the three structures had been interconnected at some point in their lives, by 79 CE the doors between them were blocked. Nevertheless, the restaurant had no kitchen in its final phase, strongly suggesting that the three continued to function as a unit, even without internal communication 5 . Our work in the 2022 season targeted three areas of Property I 14, 1/11-13: the shop in the southwestern corner and surrounding rooms (Zone B), the garden (Zone C), and a suite of five rooms in the northeastern corner of the property, all of which appear to have functioned as dining rooms at the time of the eruption in 79 CE (Zone D). We aimed first to understand the chronological development of the architecture in these areas, building a larger picture of when the building was erected, how it changed through time, and what preceded it. We sought also to understand the infrastructure that allowed it to function, in particular water and waste management strategies as well as the organization of the garden. The results presented here are necessarily brief and preliminary; a full report will follow 6 . EXCAVATIONS IN ZONE B (AA1000, AA 4000, AA5000, AA7000) Zone B consisted of the shop at the southwestern corner of Property I 14, 1/11-13 (Entrance I 14,",

    "full_text": "The discovery of Pompeii, 2 even more than that of Herculaneum, 3 presented the Neapolitan antiquarians and the Bourbon Court, already engaged in financing the first exploits in archaeology of the young Kingdom of Naples, with an entirely new set of problems, new even compared to an Italian tradition of the excavation of antiquities by now several centuries old, particularly in Rome and its neighborhood, as at Hadrian's villa at Tivoli. The depth of the ruins and their wonderful preservation suggested that rather than expose them, as at Rome, they should follow the example of the Herculaneum excavations, using shafts and tunnels to mine the ruins, a method used three decades before by the prince d'Elboeuf, (Anon, n.d.) and more recently by the Spanish military engineer Roque de Alcubierre. (Anon, n.d.) Niccolò Marcello Venuti, the librarian of the King and a fine antiquarian, argued for exposure of the ruins, at Herculaneum as well: \"I would have wished -he reminded his friend Anton Francesco Gori in April 1748 -that all that beautiful Theater could be excavated in apricum [in the open air]...; I also craved for digging to start from the seaside, but I had no such authority to work in my way. \" Only an open air excavation would give the actual view of the ancient city re-emerging (fig. 1), the feature that was the most fascinating for many scholars. Thus, among the first to visit the excavations, in 1739, the French President Charles de Brosses wrote to the great naturalist Leclerc de Buffon: 6 \"there is nothing in the world more singular, than to have found an entire city under the earth.\" Even more visionary was Scipione Maffei in 1747, when he wrote: \"O what a great fortune of our times it is that there was discovered not one or another single ancient monument, but a whole city! [...] It would be desirable above all, that they decide to work from above, lifting, and carrying away that mountain of ash [...] An enormous undertaking indeed, but a little one for a powerful king and provided with heroic spirit as he is [...] in this way, we will revive the dead city, which, after a thousand and seven hundred years, will see the sun again [...] To the greatest benefit of the country, all the men of learning of Europe will flock to Naples [...] Proceeding in blind and narrow tunnels, much will be inevitably spoiled and destroyed, neither will you ever see a noble building in its entirety nor its elevations, nor you will know how and where the many statues, and the other ornaments were situated [...] It will be also inevitable to cut many objects into pieces, in order to remove them from their places and carry them away. So much has happened to many painted walls [...]. On the contrary, clearing and leaving everything in its place, the whole city would be an incomparable Museum.\" (Anon, n.d.) In 1750 Maffei applied the same ideas to Pompeii, saying to one of is Neapolitan guests, that \"if these discoveries, really rare and amazing as they are, were not covered again, [even] in his already decrepit and dilapidated age, he would put himself in a litter to have the pleasure, before dying, of seeing these miraculous remains, uncorrupted, and authentic, of noble antiquity.\" But most of the antiquarians, Italians and foreigners, supported the opposite option, considering the huge mass of volcanic material that should have to be removed, the presence of the modern town of Resina above the ancient city, elements that made any open air excavation too expensive. So Gabriel Richard (1748) stated: \"only an extreme love for antiquity could inspire a similar idea... \" 8 and Winckelmann himself thought that the idea was quite silly, writing to the Count of Bruhl \"but about the unveiling of the entire city, I would invite those who wish for this to reflect, that since the houses were crushed by the enormous weight of the lava, you would not see anything but the ruined walls ... and what advantage? What to see old ruined walls ... just to satisfy the ill-timed curiosity of few\". (Anon, n.d.) Thus the decision was made to continue mining Herculaneum through tunnels (fig. 2) that now followed, now pierced the walls, looking for paintings, statues and other ornaments to be exhibited in the new Museum Herculanense that the King had established in his new Royal Palace on the seaside of Portici. (Anon, n.d.) This method aimed at the excavation of objects to collect, without too much regard for the structures from which they were extracted; and as was traditional in all the excavations for antiquities since the Renaissance, this was also applied in the first phase to the excavations of Pompeii, which started, as we known, in 1748. (Anon, n.d.) Here on the hill of the \"Civita\" the situation was more favorable than at Herculaneum, with open countryside rather than modern settlements above it, and with the ruins buried by a much thinner and finer volcanic materials. Thus the excavations were much easier and it was possible to carry out an open-air excavation, even though the cost of expropriating the land was still a consideration. To avoid this cost for a few years the diggers proceeded in the usual way, renting only the areas they intended to explore for the time of the excavations. After recovering the ancient objects and emptying the buildings of whatever was considered interesting, the ruins were reburied and the land returned to the owners. From the 23rd of March 1748 onward this happened in the Amphitheater, in the so-called Villa of Cicero, in the house of Julia Felix, 12 in shop V.1.32. Excavators jhopped around from site to site, without any clear strategy, in search of possible precious artifacts. Apart from some objects of great value, such as the mosaic emblemata by Dioskourides or the painted figurines of dancing Maenads and Satyrs that thrilled Winckelmann (who described them as \"light as Thought and beautiful as if from the hands of Graces\"-flüchtig wie ein Gedanke, und schön, wie von der Hand der Gratien), 13 in these early years Pompeii repaid the investment with few works of art comparable to the extraordinary wealth of sculptures and paintings discovered in Herculaneum, 14 and this disappointment led the excavators to stop the undertaking after two years. The break lasted a good five years, during which digging moved, in search of a better luck, to Gragnano and the villas of Stabiae, equally despoiled and reburied, while diggers continuing to rummage through Herculaneum in underground tunnels. Finally the decision was made -and this time definitively -to go back to Pompeii, starting in 1754 at the Herculaneum Gate, and encouraged by the discovery (1763) of the first inscription that explicitly confirmed that the city they were digging was really the famous Pompeii cited by the texts. From 1763 onwards the excavators finally began to leave the excavated buildings uncovered. The same method of excavation was meanwhile improved, thanks to the contribution of new technicians who had joined the Spanish military engineers, as the French Pierre Bardet 15 and the Swiss Karl Weber, praised by Winckelmann for his \"clever principles.\" (Anon, n.d.) A debate between Weber and the restorer Paderni is a good example of the different points of view of those who aimed to detect and study the ancient buildings and those who still cared only for the artifacts. 17 So Paderni writes in 1761: \"[Weber] is stubborn in mapping… [Herculaneum], Pompeii and Stabiae, claiming through his Swiss reasons these maps to be more necessary and to have more relevance than any monuments or artifacts that you could (Anon, n.d.) The opposition between the two points of view was stark, all the more so in that now, left in sight and stripped of their decorations and their furnishings, the ancient structures of Pompeii appeared just as ordinary masonry, 19 covered with painted plaster which soon discoloured, so far from that idea of the \"incomparable Museum\" that Maffei had envisioned. And their excavation was a task so different from \"the glorious restoration\" of the ancient monuments that in 1751 Pancrazi had celebrated in the frontispiece of his \"Antiquities of Sicily\" and as one of the special virtues of King Charles, 20 not by chance portrayed with the digging tools at his feet on the \"Prodromi\" of the \"Antichità di Ercolano\". In contrast to the structures, the artifacts extracted from the excavations and entrusted to the Museum restorers exercised a safe and durable fascination. The restoration technique of the paintings had become impeccable: the paintings were cut and mounted on slate supports, according to the method of detachment widely practiced in Rome, where most recently, in 1721, Francis 12.

In a letter on 12 August 1760 Tanucci wrote to the King Charles III that Paderni disagreed with Weber saying that the latter kept busy the workers to draw his imaginary plans and hindered to get the desired fruit from the excavations \"Veber discorda da Paderni, e questo dice, che il gusto di Veber in far piante immaginarie occupa la gente e impedisce il frutto dell 'escavazioni\" (De voS 1991: 111, note 15). Nevertheless we should remember that in 1740 it had been just Paderni to request that the situation of the excavated sites \"la situazione dei luoghi\" be carefully surveyed (De voS 1991: 104). 19. The judgment on the Pompeian architecture had soon become severe; particularly it was compared with the monuments of Rome. Thus Goethe in his diary on 11 March 1787 complained that the houses of Pompeii looked more like maquettes and dolls houses than to real buildings \"mehr Modell und Puppenschrank als Gebäude». And Charles A. Amaury-Duval would observe in 1829 that \"in Pompeii, everything is nice, but nothing is beautiful; there are often some taste, grace, never grandeur or majesty... others are amazed by the pleasantness, the decor, the comfort of every house, by the beauty and the splendor of the paintings after 17 centuries, by the solidity of the construction, and especially by their elegance in a city which is yet so small. They are full of enthusiastic admiration, and find that the most modest work of the ancients is, in comparison, a reason for us to blush and to recognize our inferiority. I would be tempted to side with these last ones\" (arChitetti franCeSi 1981: 87, 89, transl. Author). 20. zevi i 1988: 13; allroGGen-BeDel 1991. I Farnese had the frescoes from the Domus Transitoria on the Palatine hill detached. The most brilliant example of this technique in Pompeii was the detachment in 1755, carried out by Joseph Canart, 21 of the entire wall of the tablinum from the praedia of Julia Felix (fig. 3), an exploit then repeated at a distance of about a century, with the detachment of the whole mosaic of Alexander in the House of the Faun. (Anon, n.d.) The problem of the protection of the painted surfaces was also quickly resolved with the adoption in 1750 of a varnish invented by the Special Artillery Commissioner Stefano Mariconi, 23 based on a mixture of beeswax in an alcohol solution that has proved so far to be effective in keeping intact the colors of the vast majority of detached frescoes. (Anon, n.d.) But the true problem was the number. Just as it would be impossible for the few available restorers to cope with the restoration of the mass of materials that were taken in the excavations -to the point that it was even decided to melt the \"useless\" fragments of bronze objects 25 -so even more unthinkable seemed the conservation of the most part, in quantitative terms, of painted plasters and floors left in situ. Rather, the fear that by bribing some guards or workers some collectors could get hold of some fragment of ancient painting left in situ led to the decision (20 April, 1761) to destroy with picks \"useless ancient colored plasters\", i.e. the paintings not reputed 25. The scandalous event was the treatment of the quadriga found in the theater of Herculaneum. Its metal -according the Winckelmann's accusation in his letter to the Earl of Brühl -had been used for casting, in addition to two big portraits of the King and of the Queen, the famous \"Mazzocchi\" Horse, that was in the truth a patchwork of pieces from many different statues and painted gypsum. The defense on behalf of the members of the Royal Herculaneum Academy was written by Ferdinando Galiani and by the Director of the Royal Museum of Capodimonte, Mattia Zarrillo: Giudizio dell'abate Winckelmann intorno alle scoperte di Ercolano contenuto in una lettera ad un amico, libretto anonimo stesa da F. Galiani e M. Zarrilli, Napoli 1765. worthy of the royal collections. We must nevertheless remember that in the face of the wave of criticism that such barbarity raised, this order was soon revoked by the royal edict of 12 November 1763. (Anon, n.d.) But in general they were satisfied just to patch up the walls to avoid their collapse, to restore the wooden lintels in the rooms to support the overlaying masonry, to fix the plaster with metal clamps, at most, to cover the top of the walls, straightened by horizontal cuts, with sloping tiles to prevent the rain infiltration. These proceedings proved completely insufficient for paintings left in place, and their rapid degradation troubled the visitors accustomed to appreciate their shining colors as soon as they emerged from the soil. In 1782 the Swedish Admiral and Earl Carl August Ehrensvärd writing to his friend Louis Masreliez after a visit in Pompeii recalled having seen the \"terrible spectacle\" of the pavements in mosaic and of the wall paintings destroyed by the frost. (Anon, n.d.) A few years later, in 1786, the Polish Prince Stanislaus Poniatowski, nephew of the last Polish King Stanislaus II, noted: \"I found --that the paintings of this lovely building [the Temple of Isis], as well as all the others, had suffered since 1765 when I was here, in such a manner that they are almost unrecognizable. The scant care they have for the maintenance of these buildings makes it possibly a good thing for the Arts that excavations are so slow and that many buildings that were brought to light have been reburied.\" (Anon, n.d.) An early example of a temporary shelter is a wooden structure with a thatched roof (the so called \"lupinati\" quoted by the reports of the Soprastanti), 29 erected on the temple of Isis and known from a Desprez's drawing 30 and a Philipp Hackert painting (fig. 4), (Anon, n.d.) but these were a kind of protection not only rarely adopted, but also absolutely unstable and 26. zevi 1980: 58. 27. olauSSon 2015: 56 and note 9. 28. BilinSKi 1982. 29. From 1765 the Minister Tanucci ordered La Vega to provide some protection to the paintings \"which should remain in the temple of Isis\". And La Vega answered that he would \"build for the paintings in the portico a shelter of the same kind that I believe should be done for the temple, but with a lighter wooden structure and with a cover of straw instead of brick tiles, as it is usual for the huts\" (\"un coperto.. della stessa forma che stimo doversi fare il tetto, solo con la differenza di farlo di legno più leggiero e di mettervi invece di tegole delle stoppie, come si sogliono fare le capanne\": Strazzullo 1982 B: 266-267. The pictures of Desprez and Hackert show that finally also the shelter on the temple remained covered by straw. 30. louiS-Jean DeSPrez, Isis Temple in Pompeii, Nationalmuseum Stockholm, in PoMPei e l'euroPa 1748-1943:18 and 67, Cat. N. 1.12 a. 31. Cfr. View of the Great Theater of Pompeii (1793), gouache on pen, Klassik Stiftung Weimar, Graphische Sammlungen (StolzenBurG et al. 2008: 309). inadequate, a sign that the battle for the preservation of the paintings in situ was intended to be completely lost, at least until the decision, at the end of the following century, to install more effective shelters or to rebuild the ancient roofs. In the end, from the very beginning, the Bourbon excavators had resigned themselves, even without explicitly saying so, to the slow, inevitable loss of the decorations left in place, believing that the only possible protection, the one that would ensure the perpetual preservation of what was dug, was graphic documentation and subsequent publication in the \"Antichità di Ercolano\". The care for this activity was absolute, with accurate survey and measurements, carried out by skilled draftsman before the detachment of the selected panels (e.g., in the temple of Isis (fig. 5)), a quality of documentation that still made it possible to reconstruct in a model the original state of the decoration about two and a half a century after the excavations. (Anon, n.d.) There was, however, a basic reason for this resignation, namely the endemic shortage of financial resources. The cost of the excavations in fact fell, like that of all the other Royal Sites, on the budget of the Royal Household, as the King was the private owner both of the excavations and of the museum. Despite the regime of absolute monarchy, it was impossible for the King to spend much more even though it exposed him to sometimes fierce criticism from his guests, as happened during the visit of the Archduke and Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II of Austria to his brother-in-love, the King of Naples Ferdinand IV. The two sovereigns visited Pompeii on April 6 th , 1769 accompanied by the Queen Maria Carolina, the Austrian Ambassador Count Kaunitz, the English Ambassador William Hamilton, 33 and provided of the learned guide of the antiquarian-adventurer Pierre d'Hancarville. \"Their Majesties came in the first place to the Quarter [the so-called Gladiators Barracks, the porticus post scaenam behind the Theater NdT], and they wanted to examine all its parts with attention [ ...] The Austrian Sovereign observed with pleasure the building, but regretted that they had not also removed the 32.

From this place their Majesties went to the West in a house where ... as by a previous order of H.E. the Marquis Tanucci the number of workmen had been increased a few days since,... they watched with pleasure the digging, and after a short time a bronze vase emerged [and many others things]. [The Emperor] congratulated the King for having made this day such a good hunt... then he asked La Vega how many workmen were employed in that work, and having learned that they were 30, he said to the King, how he could allow that such a work go so feebly. And when he was answered that little by little everything would be done, the Emperor added, that there was not in Europe, in Asia, in Africa and in America a similar thing, and that this was a very special honor to the Kingdom; then he asked the King about who was in charge of these antiquities, and he was told it was the Marquis Tanucci. Her Majesty the Queen showed the same displeasure, and together they urged the King to put more labour into this work ...\" 34 This was not a job for 30 workers, but \"a work to employ three thousand men\": such was the severe final judgment of the young Archduke. Some years afterwards the King of Sweden, Gustav III, visiting Pompeii on 12 February 1784, was also disappointed by the slowness of the excavations. (Anon, n.d.) The idea of digging the whole of the city quickly was not only held by Emperors and Kings but was also shared by many travelers, like the Englishman John Moore (in Naples in 1770-75), who criticized the Bourbon court for their lack of strategy, \"they dig only to chase treasures. If the attention of the King was less sensitive to precious artifacts, the city [Pompeii] would be now completely unearthed. The beggars of Naples could accomplish the work in a year's time\". (Anon, n.d.) . This criticism about the slowness of the excavations did not take into account either the foreseeable impossibility of conserving the city, especially if excavated in such hurry, or the poverty of the Kingdom (beyond the misleading opulence of the Royal palaces like Caserta or Capodimonte). The Prime Minister, Marquis Tanucci, while appreciating antiquity as a well educated man, was fully aware of the limited resources in Naples. So when the Ambassador of Naples in Paris Ferdinando Galiani informed him of the French criticism of the slow pace of the publications of the antiquities discovered, he replied: \"... we [Neapolitans are poor, and we can't follow in their footsteps a rich Nation (the French) until we bleed ourselves dry [just to satisfy their wish for more copies of the Antiquities].\" 37 For the same economic reasons it was decided to employ children in the excavations alongside adult workers and Tunisian slaves: on October 29, 1763, in view of the excavation of the Herculaneum Gate, the order was given \"to choose, in addition to the workers of the excavation of Pompeii, fifteen children paid one carlino a day.\" Soon they would be joined by women, to the delight of the picturesque sensibilities of foreign painters. But even the workers' wages were miserable: on March 10, 1764 \"Master Antonio Scognamiglio, his children, and all the workers of Pompeii, complain that they are, in Torre Annunziata, in dire need from hunger, as they cannot have bread, rarely paying four grana the eight-ounce piece...\" Despite these difficulties, however, the excavations were no longer just a King's whim. The antiquities around Vesuvius had become an obligatory stop on the Grand Tourparticularly since the Museum of Portici was picked out by such famous travelers as Goethe in his \"Journey in Italy\" (he was in Naples in 1787) as \"the alpha and omega of all collections of antiquities\" 38 and Vesuvius started to be studied by amateur scientists like William Hamilton or depicted by specialized painters such as Pierre Volaire, . This indisputable international prestige was not accompanied, however, by a real consensus of Neapolitan society, not only of the largely illiterate populace, but also of those same educated and enlightened people who hoped for deep reforms capable of raising the Southern population from misery and who saw in the archaeological excavations a strategy of the Court to deter foreign visitors from understanding the most urgent problems of the Kingdom 39 . Thus Ferdinando Galiani wrote in a letter to the physician Antonio Cocchi \"The ultramontane 34. fiorelli 1860-64, under the date. 35. olauSSon 2015: 56 reports a passage of the letter of the King to the Earl G. P. Creutz \"the day before yesterday I was in Pompeii. There is nothing more fascinating than this discovery and it's really sad that they do not work with a greater ardor\". And, writing to his sister: \"I regret that the excavations of these interesting and unique memories are not yet completed.\" 36. fino 1988: 20, note 10. 37. aJello 1988: 55. 38. J.W.

Come then, my dear Cocchi, to see this country in the way it should rightly be seen. You, who have an healthy intellect, you will find pleasure finding the hidden causes of many strange phenomena, and you will not feel harassed if the stones of Herculaneum miss a distinguished interpreter and the cinerary urns of the tombs of the Nonii are so broken as to be eternally wept for as lost. I write this because I begin to be tired of the complaints of the learned travelers... \" The idea of digging all the ancient city as fast as possible remained in the background in the French period as well (Anon, n.d.) . Apart from the rushed excavations carried out by General Championnet at the time of the ephemeral Neapolitan Republic in 1799 41 , the second Herculaneum Academy (1787) tried to rationalize the excavation work with powerful earthworks to complete the large buildings left half -filled, such as the Theater (1792-93) or the Odeion (1793-1795) and they went so far as to experiment with explosives in areas free from structures in order to dig faster. (Anon, n.d.) At the request of the new King Joseph Bonaparte, the Chief Superintendent of the Royal Museum and of the excavations of the Kingdom, Michele Arditi, 43 prepared a new plan of Pompeii with a large project of expropriation and a resumption of excavations on the via Consulares and the Street of tombs. To remove the earth from the excavations, they decided to use, instead of wheelbarrows, whose maintenance was expensive, a chain of buckets operated by children, 44 who, in addition to their low cost, in this way would be removed from idleness and could harden \"their limbs to fatigue to gradually become useful farmers for the countryside, and able to defend the fatherland\". But once again, the funds allocated were not sufficient to the project: \"the work continues -states a record on February 10, 1808 -but the workers are missing, unable to exist without weekly wages, nor do I have the courage to force them.\" At the end of the reign of Joseph Bonaparte (1808), only the houses of Sallustius, of Apollo and that of Baker had been dug. The new royal couple, Joachim Murat and his wife Caroline Bonaparte, addressed the theme of Pompeii with the urge to show in this field too the benefits of the \"French system\". It was above all Caroline's \"anticomania\" (she will be mocked as \"the Queen of Pompeii\" by the pro-Bourbons), that had a decisive influence (fig. 6). (Anon, n.d.) Thanks to substantial new funding for the excavations, from 1809 on a hundred workers dug there, with the intention, explicitly declared by the rulers in a visit on October 3, 1809, to see \" the entire city dug up promptly\" \"wiping out\" the earth mass quickly, even \"in three or four years\" according to the Queen, (Anon, n.d.) Caroline added to the State funds 2000 ducats a month from her personal funds to speed the excavations by engaging hundreds of workers -the record is 624 in mid-September of 1813 for the excavation of the Amphitheatre. In March 1814, 25 carts were at work, replacing the bucket chains. These large expenditures also caused a change in the administrative management: in 1811, after a vain resistance, antiquarians had to accept the idea of \"Roads Engineers,\" chosen by the \"perverse practice of the reverse auction,\" considered a danger for the safe carrying out of the excavations and of the restorations. The winner of the tender, the contractor Giuseppe dell'Aquila would then be reconfirmed for decades, to fuel long suspicions about the correctness of his management and rumors about the real causes of poor maintenance. Caroline would even get from her husband a regiment of sappers (Mazois counted up to 1500), who, however, were used in the excavation of the Amphitheater and of the city walls as it was deemed prudent to avoiding using this not entirely reliable staff on the ancient houses. (fig. 7) . The strategy was, however, very clear. As Charles de Clarac, the painter who tutored the king's sons, wrote in 1813: \"... it is very interesting to know the perimeter [of the city]; on the other hand it will be a great advantage in order to speed the excavations.\" 47 Such an undertaking required a systematic approach. Thus Arditi declared the urgency of an inventory of the site: \"... we could not expect to find in Pompeia things really very precious as artistic masterpieces; the most substantial point is to bring to light all the perimeter of the city and to know exactly its dimension [...] it will be fine to give a name to each city district, to the streets and to the houses and to give a number to these [...] ; it 46. fiorelli 1860-1864, at the date 3 October 1809. Some days before, on 28 September, in his letter to the Minister Capecelatro, Arditi had set out his clear program, aimed not at searching for objects but at discovering the ancient city, which should be considered the most interesting monument: \"... la principale mia idea [è] posta nel dissotterrare la città, e non già nel trovare oggetti antichi. La città che dopo duemila anni vien fuori si deve tenere senza dubbio pel maggiore e pel più interessante monumento\" (ibidem: 231 ss.). 47. Biography in a note in Architetti Francesi 1981: 287; another one by N. Monteix, in C.Barbillon, Ph. Sénéchal (curr.), Dictionnaire des historiens de l'art actifs en France de la Révolution à la Première Guerre Mondiale (1789-1920), http://www.inha.fr/resources/publications/ dictionnaire-critique-des-historiens-de-l'art/mazois-françois.html. would be necessary, as the excavation progresses, to have an exact inventory [...]. It would be necessary to have, one day, a map of all the houses in the city.\" (Anon, n.d.) The Queen's architect, François Mazois, did excellent work in his surveys and in his studies of graphic restoration, establishing the basic tools for those \"Essays of Restoration\", to which the \"French Winckelmann\", Quatremère de Quincy, the Secretary of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, 49 pushed the scholars of the French Academy 50 , although he himself found the Pompeian architecture of poor quality. Beside the scientific studies, more immediate measures for the preservation of the structures were also taken. Thus Minister Zurlo, concerned about the conservation of the excavations of Pompeii and the consistent abuse in the restorations of extensions and additions that threatened to obscure the ancient parts, created in 1813 a Commission consisting of three archaeologists (Michele Arditi, Carlo Maria Rosini and Francesco Maria Avellino) and three architects (Francesco Carelli, Francesco Maresca and Raffaele Minervini). The Commission drew up a Rule 51 that paid particular attention to the preservation both of \"any piece of ancient plaster\" by copper clamps and edge strips of modern mortar, and even of bare walls, that, should it be necessary, could also be covered with new plaster. After his return in 1815, King Ferdinand of Bourbon did not want to appear to have beenoutdone on Pompeii's stage by his French predecessors so that, despite the lack of funds that obliged the improvident decision to return to private hands the areas of the city expropriated by the French, 52 great amounts of digging took place (fig. 8), completing the excavations of the Forum, of the Forum Baths, of the Temple of Fortuna Augusta, and finally joining the two worksites of the Theatres and of the Tomb Road (fig. 9). Nor were the 48.

Pompei non avrebbe avuto né le opportunità, né i mezzi, per innalzare quei grandi monumenti in cui l'arte può sfoggiare tutte le sue risorse. Vi si trovano, infatti, più o meno, tutti gli edifici che caratterizzano le grandi città, ma, per così dire, al diminutivo, sia nel modulo compositivo, sia infine per la qualità e la taglia dei materiali impiegati.\" fino 1988: 28, nota 21. 50. arChitetti franCeSi 1981. 51. 1. Si desidera, che qualunque pezzo di vecchio intonaco si ritrovi sia gelosamente conservato, e non parendole sufficiente il circondarlo con intonaco nuovo propone, che si faccia uso de' chiodi di rame inventati da Carlo Maratta, non già di quelli di ferro soggetti ad una pronta decomposizione, che si sono finora adoperati in Pompei. Quest'operazione è precisamente necessaria per gli intonachi dipinti, che fanno la maggiore bellezza della distrutta Pompei. 2. L'intonaco nuovo, col quale si circonda l'antico dovrà esser composto con ottima calce, e con arena, e dove si tratta d'opere rispettabili, anche con polvere di marmo, affinché riesca perfettamente solido e tale che impedisca alle piogge di penetrare nell'intonaco antico. 3. Si prescrive di usare tutta la possibile economia nel rivestire le vecchie mura d'intonaco nuovo. La Commissione ha riconosciuto la necessità pe' muri molto corrosi, e d'opera incerta, e per questi suggerisce, che vi si lascino degli spazi non coverti, i quali faccian conoscere il genere di costruzione dell'antico muro e diano ora sicuro argomento come distinguerlo. Per quelli poi di mattoni e ad opera reticolata, e altri che siano perfettamente nobili, la Commissione opina di non rivestirli. 4. Affinché vi sia una perpetua distinzione tra la parte antica e la parte restaurata, propone la Commissione che una linea di permanente colore o serpeggiante o retta secondo l'andamento del restauro vi sia sempre impressa ... e che sulla faccia della parte ristaurata si metta in volgare Italiano la data del mese, e dell'anno, preceduta dalla parola RESTAURO intera o mezza. 5. Che in generale tutti gli intonachi si eseguano con buona calce e ottima arena affinché non accada l'inconveniente che tra poco tempo le nuove ruine si confondano, e imitino le antiche. Per la qual cosa si userà anche la diligenza praticata finora di lasciare i nuovi intonachi in uno stato di rozzezza, affinché si discerna la modernità del lavoro. (Translation by the Author: 1. We desire that any piece of ancient plaster found be jealously conserved, and if it is not deemed sufficient to surround it with new plaster, we suggest the use of the copper clamps invented by Carlo Maratta, instead of the iron ones subject to a rapid decomposition, which have so far been used in Pompeii. This operation is specifically required for the painted plaster, which forms the greatest beauty of the destroyed city of Pompeii. 2. New plaster, with which to surround the ancient one, should be made up with excellent lime, and sand, and in the case of excellent works of art, even with marble powder, so that it becomes perfectly solid and can inhibit rainfall from penetrating the ancient plaster. 3. We prescribe all the possible economy in covering the ancient old walls with new plaster. The Commission recognized the need for walls which are badly eroded, and in opus incertum, and for these suggests leaving some areas uncovered, through which it would be possible to recognize the type of construction of the ancient wall and to have a clear evidence to distinguish it. For the wall in brick and in opus reticulatum, and others that are perfectly noble, the Commission thinks it best not to cover them. 4. In order to have a perpetual distinction between the ancient and the restored part, the Commission proposes that a line of permanent color, meandering or straight according to the way of the restoration, should be imprinted forever... and that on the face of the restored area should be put a label in vulgar Italian with the indication of the month and the year preceded by the word (whole or half) RESTAURO. 5. We prescribe that as a general rule all plasters be executed with good lime and excellent sand so to avoid the inconvenience that in a short time the new ruins be confused, and imitate the ancient ones. To that effect it will also be used the -so far-practiced diligence, to leave the new plaster in an unfinished state, so that the modernity of the work is discernible...). 52. aDaMo MuSCettola 2001. works limited to digging: in 1823 3,000 additional ducats were allotted for the restoration of the ancient buildings according to a plan proposed by Michele Arditi and Antonio Bonucci (fig. 10). One year later a special Commission chaired by Carlo M. Rosini was established to set new \"Instructions\" for the restoration of the buildings of Pompeii that remained in force until the unification of Italy. (Anon, n.d.) In addition to some practical 1. Whatever wall belonging to buildings that should be henceforth discovered in Pompeii, this should be excavated in no way other than on both sides, at the same time, and gradually. 2. In the moment of the excavation the Architect Director, under the terms of the Regulation in force, shoud provide an exact record of the detached parts of the buildings, indicating the site of the same, their shape, size, and any other circumstances needed not to lose the evidence of the ancient structure of these buildings, how the doorways and the windows are, where are the holes for the timbers and the like. He will also add drawings and plans, as happens now. 3. In the same time that walls are excavated, on their extremities a plaster should be applied to prevent degradations that could result from penetration of rainwater. The ancient plasters, painted or unpainted, if they are not firmly attached to walls, should also be carefully held firm by sharp pointed bronze clamps, so that they do not get ruined. The Architect Director will examine their condition, and after calculating the necessary expenditure, will apply to this Royal Secretariat and the Ministry of State the authorization to execute them. conservation measures that were established -tiles and mortars for the tops of the walls, clamps, etc. -(fig. 11), these Instructions were primarily aimed at delimiting the field of discretion of the Architect Director, who could authorize only \"urgent restorations, aimed at avoiding the collapse of the ancient walls and other parts of ancient buildings, applying props or technical means\", while any other issue had to be submitted to the Ministry 4. The restorations are divided into urgent and ordinary, and the latter into small and important. The urgent restorations are aimed at avoiding the ruin of the walls and other parts of ancient buildings, by applying props or other artifices, and these restorations are entirely entrusted to the care and diligence of the Architect Director, who alone remains responsible. In this part he is authorized to do everything that he considers appropriate and should only report directly to the Ministry. Ordinary restorations of small importance consist in rebuilding some small part of a wall and in putting back in its place pieces moved away and detached. Important restorations consist in the reconstruction of some ancient building, in the reconstruction of their roofs and the like. 5. No restoration of the ordinary kind can be executed before the Commission has given its opinion and this has been approved. Therefore the Architect Director will explain to the Commission by a reasoned report the restorations to be carried out, adding plans, drawings and notes as quoted in previous art. 2. The Commission will meet twice a month in one of the rooms of the Royal Museum, to revise the projects and propose the necessary. The Architect Director, when he can, will be present at the sessions and take part in the deliberations. The opinions of the Commission will be recorded on separate sheets, one for the small restorations and another one for the important ones, in both of them with indication of the expenditure. 7. If the Commission deem necessary that two of its components, i.e. a member of the Herculaneum Academy and another of the Fine Arts Academy, should transfer to Pompeii when the important restorations are carried out in order to observe their progress, it will request it reporting to this Ministry through the President of the Royal Society and will wait for the approval). Some of the decisions of the Commission, regarding the restorations to the Forum's buildings, are still preserved. In particular a decision of 1830: \"I. Doversi restaurare la porta pubblica verso il sobborgo Augusto Felice, rifare la parte caduta della volta, e costruirvi un lastrico al di sopra di lapillo battuto. Doversi fasciare le lesioni nelle volte delle terme. Doversi riguardare come ben eseguito il ristabilimento delle colonne ne' portici della casa del Centauro cogli stessi pezzi antichi, e rifatte le mura del sotterraneo. 2. Non doversi poi eseguire alcun restauro ne' alle volte del sotterraneo medesimo, tranne quei rinforzi dettati dall'arte per non farle crollare né alla Casa di Meleagro, nè alla cella del tempio di Venere oltre a quelli già eseguiti. 3. Per ciò che riguarda la riparazione delle fabbriche in qualche sito del Foro, nella strada che vi conduce ed altrove, doversi fare soltanto ciò che strettamente occorre per non farle rovinare ed eseguirsi per norma generale il meno che sia possibile\". and the Commission itself. Equally interesting are the Instructions given in 1828 for the restoration of the excavations of Herculaneum, 54 then restarted for the first time in the open air (the House of Argos and the House of Aristides). The discovery of the timber-framed masonry and of clear elements of the upper floors, which are typical of the situation in Herculaneum, suggested some more specific instructions: How \"small walls or partitions, only used for internal divisions, when they are no longer able to stand, should be rebuilt to the same height of about 6 palms \" or \"upper floors should be rebuilt in the areas that most require it: in the remaining parts only new planking will be adapted \" and \"on one single occasion only, a small upstairs room should be covered by a roof to the original dimensions and pattern, so that an indelible and sure record of this interesting and hitherto questionable element of ancient architecture be preserved\". At Pompeii, too, roofs were an issue. The idea of protecting some buildings of the site by stable roofs or even by complete reconstructions had been in the air for a long time, especially for \"touristic\" purposes. Thus Stanislaus Poniatowski (visiting Pompeii in 1785-86) wrote: \" ... it would be a good thing , if they had restored in the best way the Barracks, the Theatre , the temple of Isis , a country-and a city house, leaving in its place what had been found; and to erect in a well-chosen site a building in which all the ancient artifacts of this site could be deposited with explanations that recalled exactly the provenance; and to build a comfortable hotel, and to give to the national and foreign visitors the freedom to see, draw and measure everything; thus the country 54. 1. Gli architravi antichi debbono essere rimpiazzati co' nuovi in tutte le parti ove sostengono delle fabbriche. Per tale operazione si debbono queste demolire (se ciò fosse inevitabile) e poscia riedificare per l'altezza di circa palmi 6, onde il disegno dell'antico edifizio non resti perduto. 2. Le colonne debbono essere ripristinate co' loro medesimi pezzi, ed i capitelli ristaurati ne' siti ove sono meno danneggiati, sul modello delle parti conservate. 3. Le piccole mura o telajetti, serviti per la sola divisione interna e che non potessero più sostenersi, verranno rifatti per la stessa altezza di circa palmi 6, e per lo stesso motivo. 4. I pavimenti delle stanze superiori verranno ricostruiti nelle parti che più lo richiederanno: pel rimanente vi si adatterà di nuovo soltanto il tavolato. 5. Per una volta sola si coprirà d'un tetto sulle misure e sul modello antico, una stanzina del piano superiore, affinché rimanga un monumento indelebile e sicuro di quest'interessante e finora dubbiosa parte dell'antica architettura. Translation by the Author: I. The public gate toward the Augustus Felix suburban neighbourhood should be restored, the fallen part of the dome should be reconstructed, and a floor should be laid above the beaten lapilli layer. The cracks in the vaults of the Baths should be consolidated. The restoration of the columns in the porticos of the House of the Centaur using the ancient pieces of them, and the reconstruction of the basement walls should be regarded as well executed. to prevent them from spoiling should be done and that following the general rule of minimal possible intervention 1. The ancient lintels must be replaced by new ones in all the parts where they support constructions. For this operation it is permitted to demolish them (when this is unavoidable) and afterwards to rebuild them to the height of about 6 palms, whereby the shape of the ancient building be not lost. 2. The columns must be restored using their same pieces, and the capitals restored in the less damaged parts, on the model of the preserved parts. 3. Small walls or partitions, only used for internal divisions, when they are no longer able to stand, should be rebuilt to the same height of about 6 palms and for the same reason. 4. The upper floors should be rebuilt in the areas that most require it: in the remaining parts only new planking will be adapted. 5. On one single occasion only, a small upstairs room should be covered by a roof to the original dimensions and pattern, so that an indelible and sure record of this interesting and hitherto questionable element of ancient architecture be preserved. would be given a lot of money and taste ...\" 55 . In his turn, in his \"Voyage à Costantinople, en Italie et aux îles de l'Archipel\" (Paris 1798) Chateaubriand had imagined 56 \"leaving the things in the sites where and how they had been found, reconstruct roofs, ceilings, floors and windows to prevent the degradation of paintings and walls, all this within a general plan to make a great Pompeian \"Museum of the Domestic History of the Roman People\". This idea was now gradually returning into vogue now that the Northern tourists, especially the British, were returning in large numbers to Pompeii, 57 provided with excellent new guidebooks such as the W. Gell's Pompeiana, (Anon, n.d.) To support the growing \"tourist\" attractiveness of the site, the staff responsible for Pompeii began to think of leaving valuable paintings in situ under shelters. It was decided in this way in 1820 that a painting of Mars and Venus, should be left in place and protected by \"a box on the wall where it exists, to be opened at will\". In the following year, having decided to leave in situ other paintings, they put in wooden gates to prohibit entrance into unguarded houses. It is perhaps no coincidence that one year after the enactment of the new regulations for the ruins of Pompeii, and the first draft of the Regulations for the Royal Bourbon Museum in 1829, a general make-over of the excavations was carried out by consolidating the plaster and the walls (fig. 12), covering the paintings with a protective varnish using the new recipe invented by the Neapolitan painter Andrea Celestino, putting plates with names and numbers on the streets and houses, repositioning in situ slate copies of the most important inscriptions and gypsum replicas of the most beautiful statues from Pompeii in the Naples Museum (fig. 13). Even the local service structure was improved. At the suggestion of the Royal Academy of Archaeology, in 1824 a small restoration workshop was created in the excavations to restore the bronze objects before sending them to Naples, and a room was set up for the draughtsmen. In the meantime, far from Pompeii, the \"Essais de Restauration\" of Foreign Architects 59 started to be reflected in daring real reconstructions of Pompeian houses: so the Pompejanum (fig. 14) erected in 1841 in Aschaffenburg on the 55. BilinSKi 1982: 75. 56. arChitetti franCeSi 1981: 43; zevi 1980: 62; De ChateauBrianD 1947: 69; Galletier 1934. On the history of this idea, recently MilaneSe 2015. Among the first, and in a less poetic way, the idea had been advanced by the Earl of Salisbury in his visit to the Portici Museum in 1791 (fino 1988: 31 and note 28): to return to life an unearthed city would be a simpler and more beautiful idea. If all this furniture and these implements, at which we look emotionless ranged along the clean walls of a Museum crammed like an immense deposit of trinkets, had been replaced in good order in the houses of Pompeii, the illusion would be created in its entirety, and everything would arouse a greater respect and a stimulate greater curiosity (paraphrase by the Author). The political crisis of 1848 rang the alarm about the problems of the excavations. The King was obliged to accept to set up a Special Committee \"of learned people and egregious artists\" to \"procure a reorganization and reforms in Royal Bourbon Museum and in the Excavations of antiquities of the Kingdom\" which produced a draft proposal of an \"Organic Law for the Royal Museum of Antiquities and the Excavations\", which was never issued because of the violent end of the constitutional attempt. The Commission, very strict with the renovations and roofing projects in Pompeii 62 , dictated some specific articles of the Regulation on the way of carrying out the restorations, which constitute evidence of some \"best practices\" of the time (tiles at the top of the walls, propping, clamps for the plasters, seasonal straw protections for the most important paintings and sand covering for mosaics) (Anon, n.d.) . 60. SinKel 1964. 61. On this topic, recently ManGone 2015 62. Among them that painting, deemed \"indecent\" by the Acting Architect Director Carlo Bonucci, in the recently excavated house of M. Lucretius (or of the Suonatrici, IX, 3, 5) 63. 194. Come saranno interamente scoverte le mura, di un edifizio [...] verranno preservate nella parte superiore con tegole, o da uno strato di malta o d'asfalto, affinché l'acqua non filtri nelle pietre e le sconnetta. Si avrà speciale cura dell'Architetto perché il motivo de' ruderi non sia deturpato con improprio aggiustamento di linee. 195. Le mura, che minacciano di cadere saranno subito puntellate per rinforzarle con fabbrica di mattoni o di pietre secondo il bisogno, ed il luogo. Translation by the Author: 194. As they will be entirely uncovered, the top of the walls of a building [...] will be conserved aby putting tiles on them, or a layer of mortar or asphalt, so to avoid the rainwater from filtering among the stones and disconnecting them. The Architect should have a special care not to disfigure the shape of the ruins by an improper adjustment of the lines. 195. The walls that threaten to collapse will be immediately shored up to strengthen them with brick or stone structures, according to the need and the site. 196. The mortar suspected of an imminent detachment from the walls should be fixed at their ends by copper clamps with sharp points, or by strips of mortar or asphalt; this should be carried out with any other plaster when it seems necessary. 197. At the end of October of every year the walls that have a greater need of care or caution because of the quality, importance and refinement of their decoration should be covered with straw mats in a wooden framework arranged as not to touch the paintings. Although the planned Excavations Reform ended together with the constitutional government, the need for a general rethinking remained. It was left to one of the protagonists of the Commission of '48, Giuseppe Fiorelli, to accomplish some of its goals after Italian Unification. (Anon, n.d.) Engaged in proving its superiority over the previous Italian kingdoms, including in the field of the protection of antiquities, the new Italian government, established by the Piedmonteses in 1861, allocated 110,000 Lira per year for the restarting of the excavations of Pompeii, almost in the manner of Caroline Murat, with as many as 512 workers. One year later King Vittorio Emanuele II personally inaugurated the new excavations of Herculaneum ( 1868 15). (Anon, n.d.) During this period the use of photography for documentary purposes was consolidated (after its initial use for \"artistic\" and \"touristic\" purposes) (fig. 16) 67 , the Soprastanti were required to dig from the top of the ground down, and to observe and to register in the \"Giornale degli Scavi\", the Excavations Journal\" 68 even the smallest details because they would serve for the reconstruction of the ancient buildings, although Fiorelli still preferred graphic documentation. (Anon, n.d.) Fiorelli showed a great prudence, even restraint, in the restorations, limiting himself to a very few interesting anastyloses such as the portico of the temple of Apollo (fig. 17) (Anon, n.d.) . Eugene E. Viollet-le-Duc's praise of Fiorelli is significant 71 : he says that the new excavations at Pompeii after 1860 are \"directed and performed methodically and (...have the quality...) of preserving evidence that in other times was overlooked. The care is pushed as far as possible, and so the results are really instructive. Past mistakes have been corrected and we begin to have a pretty good idea of the construction of these houses and the way in which they were fitted with wood paneling and furniture.\" And yet it will certainly not have escaped Fiorelli, engaged in the elaboration of the famous cork model of 68. CaStiGlione Morelli Del franCo 1991. 69. In his report of 1873 (fiorelli 1873: 85 ss.), Fiorelli points out the caution to be used during the excavations \".. qualsiasi pezzo di marmo, di pietra o di intonaco, che mostri di essere stato divelto dal suo posto primitivo nell'atto dello scavo, sarà immediatamente collocato al suo posto con calce, con grappe di ferro, o con altri modi richiesti dal bisogno […] i mattoni interi, le pietre, i marmi …verranno serbati per poi essere adoperati ne' restauri. Le mura dipinte, appena scoverte, dovranno essere con diligenza ripulite e nettate con ferri e spazzole a tal uopo destinate […]. E' vietato di lavorare o graffiare con ferri qualunque oggetto, dovendo solo essere nettato dalla terra che lo circonda\" (any piece of marble, stone or plaster, showing itself, at the moment of digging, to have been torn from its original place, will be immediately replaced in its position by means of lime, iron clamps, or other ways required by the need [... ] the unbroken bricks, stones, marbles ... will be stored to be later reused in the restorations. The painted walls just discovered, must be diligently cleaned and netted with tools and brushes designed to this purpose [...]. It is forbidden to work or scratch with iron tools any ancient object, having only to be cleansed from the soil surrounding it; translation by the Author). In the following report sent to the Minister of the Public Instruction in 1885 (fiorelli 1885: 58), he is very prudent regarding the restorations by reconstruction, stating that in view of them very accurate preliminary studies needed to be carried out: \"Occorre che ai restauri degli edifici riconosciuti degni di tutela procedano i necessari studi storici ed artistici, affinché coloro che devono attendervi, possano trasportarsi nell'età in cui quelli furono innalzati e giudicare pienamente della loro esatta reintegrazione\" […]la conservazione dei monumenti e degli oggetti riuscirà completa quando sarà preceduta dall'opera di ricognizione piena di tutto ciò che forma il soggetto della scienza; senza di che è assolutamente impossibile decidere di ciò che si debba conservare, e del modo di effettuarlo\" (\"It is necessary that the restoration of the buildings deserving protection should be accompanied by the appropriate historical and artistic studies, so that those tasked to carry them out can transport themselves to the period when those buildings were erected and fully judge on their exact reintegration \"[...] The conservation of the monuments and of the objects will fully succeed only when it will be preceded by the work of full examination of all that forms the subject of science; without that it is absolutely impossible to decide what it should be conserved and in which way\". Translation by the Author). Notwithstanding the focus on the most accurate restorations, it was accepted that, in case of urgent need to save paintings or mosaics considered of particular importance, they could continue to be removed from the buildings and sent to the Naples Museum, on the decision of the Council of the Superintendence and upon proposal of the Inspector assigned to the Excavations. 70. In his youth he shared the Chateaubriand's idea of a fully \"restored\" house in Pompeii. In the projected Law of reform of the excavations of Pompeii and the Naples Museum in 1848, under article 205-206 he wrote \"in Pompei sarà compiutamente restaurata una casa, le cui dipinture saranno fatte dai disegnatori del luogo. Si rimetteranno al loro posto gli oggetti rinvenuti e se vi si trovarono ossa se ne ricomporranno gli scheletri. Questa casa sarà mostrata come modello di un edificio pompeiano…\" (a house will be completely restored in Pompeii and its paintings will be executed by the local draughtsman. The objects found will be replaced in their sites, and if human bones were found, the skeletons will be reassembled. This house will be shown as a model of a Pompeian building). the excavations of Pompeii in the Naples Museum (fig. 18) 72 , how, except for those preserved in the Museum, most of the Pompeian paintings and mosaics could not be reproduced in miniature on the cork walls because they went already lost, and of them only the drawings and watercolors in the Archives remained. The only ones to survive were those conserved indoors or protected in a timely fashion by canopies: for example, the walls of the Baths, or the tablinum and other rooms in the House of the Hunt (VI, 4, 48), or the rear wall in the garden of the House of Sallustius, or of that of the Little Fountain (VI, 8, 23), or the peristyle of the House of the Dioscuri (VI, 9, 6). Both because of these conservation needs , but perhaps also under the thrust of the contemporary, successful \"Pompeianist\" paintings, such as the famous ones by Alma Tadema (fig. 19) (Anon, n.d.) , or those by the more modest but very popular Italians Fausto and Felice Niccolini (fig. 20), the disciples and successors of Fiorelli, Michele Ruggiero (1875-1893) and Giulio de Petra (1893-1901), increasingly took the initiative of rebuilding the spaces and volumes of the ancient buildings, covering them with new roofs imitating the ancient ones 74 . At first, this happened only 1748-1943: 294, cat. n. 3.10A. 74. To cover these roofs were used at first ancient tiles found unbroken in the excavations, without caring too much if they were removed , 8.6; excavation: 1879, 1881, 1902). Then, more and more systematically the issue of the full stylistic reconstruction was addressed: thus in the House of the Vettii (VI,15,1; excavated from 1894 to 1895), where not only the walls and roofs were rebuilt, but also the marble and bronze sculptures were left in place in the garden (fig. 22), in its turn replanted on the lines of the ancient plantings, while the fountains were put back into operation, as a plaque in honor of the Minister Guido Baccelli affixed on the dining room wall of the house proudly states. The example of this restoration was followed few years later in the House of the Golden Cupids (VI, 16, 7). According Antonio Sogliano, this new style of restoration had returned to Pompeii its \"artistic and archaeological interest\" 75 . Not only art: the repositioning of the \"cave canem\" mosaic in the House of the Tragic Poet had increased, on its own, the revenue from tickets, from 60,000 to 100,000 Lira! The premise of the new policy was the alleged ability not only to understand scientifically the ancient structures, enabling their faithful rebuilding, 76 but also to maintain them on-site and with them the architectural decorative elements with the same effectiveness as a museum, and, of course, with a far greater appeal to visitors. 77 . Moreover the new policy multiplied the size of the required maintenance, because of the increased from the true findspot. Between the end of the Nineteenth and the early Twentieth century a plant was installed in the excavations to produce concrete \"flat and curve tiles imitating the ancient\". Sogliano reports that for the restoration of the House of the Silver Wedding «in mancanza di tegole antiche se ne vanno costruendo delle simili in Pompei, con notevole economia di prezzo su qualunque riproduzione industriale. Ne occorrono circa ottocento, e già 250 son pronte e tali, che, se per forma e colore imitano perfettamente le antiche, restano al contrario sempre da queste distinte pei materiali onde son composte e che sono il cemento idraulico, la sabbia ed il lapillo locale» (lacking ancient tiles, new ones similar to them are being made in Pompeii, with a considerable saving of money on any industrial reproduction. About 800 are needed, and 250 are already ready and such that, if the shape and color perfectly imitate the ancient, on the contrary they remain always distinct because of the materials by which they are composed: hydraulic cement, sand and local pumice stone (lapilli). Transl. Author).CITAtion needed! 75. So SoGliano 1902. The archaeologist Antonio Sogliano, Inspector and, since 1905, Director of the Excavations, was the true theoretician and executor of these new restorations : SoGliano 1901; SoGliano 1904; SoGliano 1906; SoGliano 1907; SoGliano 1908; SoGliano 1909. 76. Unfortunately the documents reporting the excavations and restoration/conservation works written by the Soprastanti do not allow us to assess this ability: Thus e.g . eSPoSito-riSPoli, 2009, in PartiColar: 127: \"Nelle relazioni di scavo custodite presso l'archivio della Soprintendenza Archeologica di Pompei le notizie concernenti lo scavo e alle prime opere provvisionali per proteggere le strutture e le decorazioni sono quasi del tutto assenti. È molto più facile apprendere dello stato di salute degli operai addetti allo scavo, o anche degli animali da soma utilizzati per trasportare i carrelli pieni di lapillo. Altre volte le relazioni sono costellate di semplici elenchi degli operai o delle effettive giornate di lavoro\" (In the excavation reports kept in the archives of the Archaeological Superintendence of Pompeii entries related to the excavations and to the first provisional works to protect structures and decorations are almost entirely absent. It is much easier to learn about the health of the workers involved in the excavation, or even of the pack animals used to carry the trucks filled with pumice stones. In some other cases the reports are dotted with mere lists of the workers or of the actual work days. Translation by the Author). 77. In this period to protect the paintings glass sheets were used and clothes to be lifted through racks. They also moved from the use of metal clamps to the so called \"lacertini\" or \"solini\", concrete mortar strips to secure the edges of the ancient plasters and prevent the infiltration of rainwater. (SoGliano 1909: 18-19, 25). number of structures involved, both ancient and modern. Thus, although it would have been wiser to limit severely the new excavations, fitting them to the real maintenance capacity, the desire of both the Ministry and the archaeologists to dig ever more was stimulated by the great international echo that accompanied each new discovery. And when all was said and done, those generations had a great confidence in the future of the young Nation. Similarly they trusted in the new modern materials, especially iron, used in the shelters over the mosaic fountains (in the House of the Scientists, VI,14, 43, excavated 1845 (fig. 23); in the House of the Arches IX, 7, 20, excavated 1879); in the belts to strengthen unstable structures, in lintels with iron beams instead of wooden ones (although covered with wood), in the frames supporting the marble furnishings left in place (fig. 24 a, b, c). The reinforced concrete used in floors and lintels was also new, but, alas the use of local volcanic pumice stone in the mixture instead of gravel, turned out to be a huge mistake, because the porosity of the pumice has caused, over time, the oxidation of the iron frames and the collapse of the structures. Another mistake was the introduction of asbestos-concrete, the so called Eternit, then a new technology (patented by the Austrian Ludwig Hatschek in 1901) which we now know to be toxic. Beside the materials some new techniques were updated such as the lead sheets inserted at the base of painted walls to protect them from rising damp. Far more questionable was the political choice permitting all excavations outside the State-owned archaeological area of the ancient city to be carried out by private individuals with the same predatory criteria used by the first diggers of Bourbon times: they dug only to extract valuable artifacts to be sold on the international market, minus the portion owed to the State for the Naples Museum, and then reburied the remains they had stripped bare. Among the new elements of this period, we must recall the interest of the Director of Excavations (since 1905), Antonio Sogliano, and of Paolo Orsi, Special Commissioner in Naples and Pompeii in 1901, in studying the pre-Roman city's history through stratigraphic excavations (such as those newly carried out by Giacomo Boni at the Roman Forum in Rome), a branch of studies alternative to the excavation of the Roman city in extension (and certainly less critical for conservation). (Anon, n.d.) As at Herculaneum, at Pompeii the excavations of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century had provided evidence for second floors in many houses. This important element was exploited to the maximum in the campaign of excavations and restorations carried out by Vittorio Spinazzola (1911-1923) along the Via dell'Abbondanza 79 , an excavation aimed not at exploring the individual houses in depth, but only in revealing their façades along the main street of the city and rebuilding this picturesque urban setting, with its electoral propaganda posters, advertisements, the arcades of the upper floors 80 , the protruding prospects and the balconies of the houses, the shops fronts with the actual artifacts found there exhibited in glass showcases 81 . The result was a deep change in the image of Pompeii. The comparison with the almost-bare first section of the same street excavated in the Bourbon period shows how much had been lost in the previous excavations. Nevertheless, the decision to leave unexcavated the areas behind the facades would result in serious conservation problems, problems which are still unresolved. The new excavation methods were applied on a large scale by the successor of Spinazzola, Amedeo Maiuri (1923-1967) both in Pompeii 82 and in Herculaneum (fig. 25) (Anon, n.d.) . In his very extensive excavations, he not only resumed the systematic exploration of whole houses, but also practised on a large scale the reconstruction 79. Cfr. SPinazzola 1953; DelPino 2001. In the first part of his work (SPinazzola 1953: 18-32) he describes punctually his excavation and restoration methods in Pompeii. The cornerstones of them were: «1. Precisione e limitazione dell'obiettivo o degli obiettivi dello scavo, e continuità così nel proseguirli come nell'ubicazione di esso» ; 2) «Cognizione ed impostazione dei problemi della ricerca, e fede in essa»; 3) «Scavo sistematico per strati, con esame, avvicinamento e ricostruzione immediata, per strati, degli elementi architettonici rinvenuti e fotografati «in situ», e prima e poi»; 4) «Impiego delle maestranze e tecnica dello scavo e dei restauri». Translation by the Author: \"1) Accuracy and exact definition of the excavations objectives, and continuity, both in carrying out and in positioning them; 2) \"Recognition and establishment of the research problems, and faith in it\"; 3) \"Systematic excavation by layers, with examination, approach and immediate reconstruction, by layers, of the architectural elements found and photographed in situ, and before and after; 4) \"Utilization of the workers and excavation and restoration techniques\"). Spinazzola had also proposed a diversification of restoration types. Where there were sure elements available for a faithful reconstruction of the ancient buildings, then it was the reconstruction of the floors and of the structures located on the upper floor was permitted. Where, on the contrary, there were no sure elements to carry out a scientifically reliable reconstruction then only protecting shelters were acceptable , using materials completely different from the ancient ones, such as roofs of tiles or metal sheets resting on steel beams, which should however, suggest in a way, the general frame of the ancient roof. 80. Such reconstructions had had antecedents in those executed in Sogliano's time, like the balcony of the House of the Cenacolo (V 2, g). 81. See the example in the Asellina's thermopolium, where, as soon the excavation ended, all the objects and the pottery found in the shop were exhibited on the selling counter, inside a glass showcase in an iron frame. (see the pictures in Pompeii Superintendence Archive C438, C517, C568). 82. Maiuri 1928; Maiuri 1939; zevi 2001. 83. Maiuri 1929; Maiuri 1933; Maiuri 1936; Maiuri 1958a; Maiuri 1958b;.

The result, in terms of image, had a great impact on Fascist propaganda, offering Pompeii as a virtuous example of the regime's ability to manage cultural heritage both in terms of protection and in terms of touristpromotion (fig. 26) 85 . We should remember, for example, that in 1934 the Torre Annunziata -Castellammare section of the Circumvesuviana railway was opened, with a new station at the excavations, named \"Villa of the Mysteries\", to make it easier to get to Pompeii from Naples. Maiuri himself promoted new popular activities in the excavations, adding lighting (fig. 27) for night visits and the use of the theaters for staging ancient dramas. Among the restorations executed in the period before World War II, notable is the reconstruction, in 1934, of the upper part of Tower XI of the city-walls -the so-called tower of Mercury -, already studied by Mazois. Its top terrace was made accessible so that it could serve as a scenic lookout over the ruins and the surrounding countryside. Both Spinazzola and Maiuri were supported by very good technicians, such as the engineers Salvatore Cozzi and Luigi Iacono and by skilled draughtsmen and worksite assistants. Thanks to government support they were able to pay substantial attention to maintenance, cared by for by teams of masons, paintings and mosaics conservators, carpenters, blacksmiths, plumbers, and gardeners. Their techniques were often antiquated -a the use of a wax solution to coat the frescoes, actually the old Bourbon method in which petrol or formaldehyde had simply replaced alcohol, but all in all they were tested and they worked -or at least they avoided further damage. The Second World War marked a break in the excavations but not in the restoration activity, even if, given the shortage of resources, this was concentrated on the anastylosis of part of some great monuments 84. On the occasion of the restoration of the Istacidii Tomb, Maiuri observed (cfr. Maiuri 1939; note 63: «il dubbio può solo affacciarsi quando da un restauro di protezione si passi ad un restauro di ripristino, dove la sola norma da seguire è dettata dall'esperienza di chi abbia educato l'occhio all'ambiente edilizio e urbanistico di Pompei, legge suprema e inderogabile essendo quella dell'onestà senza camuffamenti del nuovo per l'antico». (\"The doubt can only arise when we pass from a protective restoration to a reconstruction restoration, where the only rule to follow is dictated by the experience of those who have educated their eyes to the built and urban environment of Pompeii; the supreme and imperative law being that of honesty, without camouflage of the new for the ancient\" (translation by the Author). 85. Sarfatti,1924. (the tomb of Istacidii 86 , the tribunal of the Basilica (fig. 28), the portico of the Forum). The lack of resources, however, meant that the restoration entailed the use of precarious solutions, such as the reuse in reinforced concrete of iron nails rescued from old gates and floors. A mention should finally be made of the devastating effects of the repeated bombing that, aiming at a German division alleged to be stationed in the ruins, struck Pompeii in September 24 1943 to 26, with more than 150 bombs, provoking destruction in the Forum, the Antiquarium and in various houses of the city (fig. 29) 87 . The unsustainable choice of expanding the excavated area was repeated after the Second World War when a new large-scale program of excavations as a way to create jobs for the unemployed was launched, not only outside the walls to clean up the great spoil heaps of the previous excavations, but also inside them, in the Regiones I and II, increasing by about one third the exposed area. Among the accompanying measures, the idea of selling the pumice (lapilli) from the archaeological layers covering the ruins to private quarry companies, authorized to take it out with the trucks from well inside the same ancient houses, caused serious damage and left a situation of incompleteness that has prevented restoration until few years ago, when it was possible to resolve it, if only partially. The Irpinia earthquake of 1980-81 marked a dramatic watershed 88 . Not so much for the actual damage, resulting only in a few collapses, but more in a general weakening of the already crumbling walls of the city. Moreover, for the first time, taking a cue from some previous systematic initiatives, such as a general photo campaign promoted by the Istituto Centrale del Catalogo, and the National Photographic Cabinet 89 , it was possible to make an exact evaluation of the whole situation. For the first time the systematic survey of the damage and the computer processing of the quantitative data allowed us (I served then as Director of the Excavations 90 ) to show that Pompeii had been excavated too much, and that the most of it had been lost (about 80% of paintings and the floors found since the beginning of the excavations) and that the cost of the conservation of the surviving structures, including those reduced to bare ruins, was well above the current budget availability (fig. 30). The continued prevalent use of the excavations for profit, with a strong emphasis on tourist use, had not helped to improve the situation. In fact, internal maintenance was almost abandoned; masons and conservators had almost disappeared, replaced by custodial staff, while the increased number of visitors -currently running towards 3 million per year -further aggravated the problems: wear, graffiti on the plasters and eroded floors, added to the problems of invasive vegetation 91 , unchecked borders of the unexcavated areas (fig. 31), resistance to weathering and uncontrolled hydrogeology 92 . This longstanding maintenance crisis has produced in recent years periodic episodes of collapse of structures. The response has been wholly inadequate for the resumption of a smooth and continuous maintenance program: Instead, a number of special laws have solved some local issues but have left unresolved the general, systemic problem. The effort to rationalize maintenance initiated by P. G. Guzzo 93 was interrupted at the end of the term of that Superintendent, and the recent experience of the Special Civil Protection Commissioneers in Pompeii, has been dedicated mainly to enhancing touristic use through \"events\" 94 . Luckily, in the meantime the excavation of new 89. Pitture e pavimenti, 1981-1986; Pompei. Pitture e mosaici 1990-1999. 90. De Caro 1983. 91. Sul problema, vedi già Maiuri 1978; Ciarallo 2004: 92. See the Michele Cordaro's considerations on the need to carry out a mapping research of the subsoil of Pompeii, to recover, besides archaeological data, information on the geological stratification beneath the city and, above all, on the water collecting and draining systems: CorDaro 2001. 93. franChi Dell 'orto 1990; lonGoBarDi-ManDara 1997; Guzzo 1999; Guzzo 2003; Guzzo 2007; lonGoBarDi 2002; riSPoli-De CaroliS-Paone 2007; eSPoSito-riSPoli 2009, in particolar: 127-133. 94. See a comment by Guzzo (2010: 7): \"Tutti ricordiamo che, secondo Winckelmann, gli ingegneri militari dell'esercito borbonico stavano al compito loro affidato di scavare Ercolano e Pompei come i granchi alla luna. In questo primo decennio del XXI secolo, più di due secoli e mezzo dopo quell'inizio, la situazione descritta dal Sassone sembra ripetersi con maggiore enfasi e una patina tecnologica, ma con simili proporzioni. Generali dell'aereonautica e soccorritori in caso di catastrofi naturali sono stati incaricati di prendersi cura di Pompei: stanti le rispettive formazioni professionali non potevano che tentare di o trasformare un'antica città in una caserma, oppure in una caricatura di se stessa, così da abbagliare gli occhi di quanti desiderano essere solamente sbalorditi..\" (We all remember that, according Winckelmann, the military engineers of the Bourbons army stood in the same relationship to the task assigned to them to excavate Herculaneum and Pompeii as crabs were to the moon. In this first ten years of the 21st century, two and half century after that beginning, the situation described by the Saxon seems to repeat itself with a larger emphasis and a technological patina, but on a similar scale. Generals of the areas have been progressively reduced to a very few and slow cases like that of the House of Julius Polybius (IX, 13, 1-3), and the complex known as the House of the Chaste Lovers (IX, 12, 6, 7, 9), where the partial reconstruction of the buildings is still protected by a canopy waiting for a final solution according to new criteria that would take into account the problem of maintenance 95 . Upon enrollment of Pompeii in the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 1997, the evaluation of the Committee on the conservation aspects took into account the many critical issues resulting from the history of the site, 96 but it considered them with generous optimism based on recent technical progress rather than the actual capacity to put conservation and maintenance back on the road to long-term sustainability. Aside from journalistic exaggerations, often moved by issues far from those of cultural heritage conservation, such an optimistic view has been put in question by events such as the Air Force and rescuers for cases of natural disasters have been assigned to care for Pompeii. Given their professional training they could only try to transform the ancient city into a barracks or a burlesque of itself, such as to dazzle the eyes of those who only wished to be stunned.\" (translation of the Author). 95. See BelloMo, M., 1999: 63-64. A recent dissertation at the Architecture Faculty of the Turin Politecnico has counted in Pompeii about 150 buildings with total or partial roofs or shelters of 29 different types, using different materials (www.architesi.polito.it/pdf/SalassaCM_ IT.pdf ); see also the lectures at the Bologna Conference of 2000 (http://www.arch.unipi.it/arco/novita/giornata.html). 96. \"Both sites, and Pompeii in particular, illustrate the evolution of conservation techniques over the past two centuries. The degree of reconstruction and the use of materials such as concrete and steel in restorations and reconstructions carried out before the 1980s would not be acceptable if performed today; they are, in fact, being replaced progressively by modern techniques and materials. It may be argued, however, that these early restorations have a historicity of their own which is worthy of some form of conservation. The wall paintings were in the past generally conserved using organic materials, which have caused little, if any, damage to them. However, the techniques used for remounting them using concrete were harmful, and a new method using instead aluminum and plastic, developed by the lstituto per il Restauro in Rome, is now being applied progressively to all the paintings. There are serious structural problems at both sites resulting from a variety of factors, such as inappropriate materials, rising damp, and rain and wind attack, and these were exacerbated by the 1980 earthquake... Several new approaches are being implemented at Pompeii. lnstead of concentrating on single buildings, restoration and conservation are being directed to entire quarters of the ancient town, consisting of one or more insulae, so as to achieve a more integrated result.\". Longobardi, Pompei sostenibile, Rome 2002) collapse of the Schola Armatorum November 6, 2010 (fig. 32). There is no doubt, in the light of the history that we have briefly related, that the conservation of Pompeii is a problem of such a size and from such ancient roots as to require, beside such specific interventions as those that will be carried out in the framework of the ongoing \"Great Pompeii Project\" funded by the European Union and the Italian Government, long-term solutions that can only be organizational. (Anon, n.d.) An organization designed to recover, in modern and updated forms, this wealth of experience dedicated to stable maintenance. We should also consider, if it proves to be necessary, drastic measures such as re-burying some areas. This work should be carried with the careful attention that John Ruskin recommended.I have had the good fortune to learn from an old worker on the Excavations: \"Take care of your monuments and you will not feel the need to restore them. Throw some lead sheets on the roof: a few leaves swept in time from the gutter will save the roof and the wall. Keep an eye on the old building with loving care, protect it the best you can at any price from any squandering influence. Count the stones and watch them; encircle it with an iron belt where it is breaking up, support it with wooden props where it declines. Don't fret because of this: it's better to have a crutch than only one leg. Do all this assiduously, with tenderness and with reverence and and many generations will be born under its shadow.\" Stefano De Caro stefadec50@gmail.com sdc@iccrom.org The Author Stefano De Caro has been since 2012 Director-General of ICCROM, the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, Rome.

    "title": "The loss of geological memory of past catastrophes: the case of Pompeii",
    "abstract": "In 79 A.D. Vesuvius buried entire cities in a few days under a blanket of pumice and ashes. It was a sudden event, which occurred after centuries of inactivity, heralded only by earthquakes that repeated periodically, for many years, creating addiction rather than alarm. After the event, the vegetation covered the volcanic products, and the memory of the disaster was lost. The first excavations began in Herculaneum in 1738 and in Pompeii ten years later, in times when archeology still did not exist. Much was destroyed, given away, thrown away. Almost intact buildings emerged, with all their contents, with many inhabitants caught on the run. The arduous process of recovering the sites has had important and not always happy stages, accompanied by continuous progress in the excavation methods. Volcanology has drawn from those experiences as much as it could, setting itself the goal of reconstructing the story of an explosive eruption, the first in the world to be described, by Pliny the Younger, the one that most left its mark on buildings, vegetation, animals and humans. Without the eruption, Pompeii and Herculaneum would have disappeared. The details on how the romans lost their lives in the tragedy is an important component to be offered to Pompeii's visitors and that is at present largely imperfect. Knowing it and reconstructing its impact on people and the territory, going beyond the archaeological site, is an experience of the past and a warning for today and for the future.",
    "full_text": "The eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE consisted in the formation of a convective eruptive column over thirty km high, followed by a convective/collapsing column producing pulsating pyroclastic density currents and ended with voluminous pyroclastic density currents. During the first part of the eruption pumices transported by the convective column fell in the direction of Pompeii where they gently accumulated up to form a deposit of about 3 m (Figure 1a). The first pyroclastic flows descended towards Herculaneum after 7-9 hours from the eruption onset and reached their climax about 18-19 hours from the eruption onset when they spread over the entire territory of the gulf. The onset of the pyroclastic flow activity was accompanied by a parallel increase of seismic shaking that reached its maximum right before the largest flow were produced. The eruption lasted no more than two or three days and between 4 and 5 cubic km of magma were emitted, mainly during the eruptive sustained column phase (Sigurdsson et al., 1985)(Anon, n.d.). The generalized stratigraphic column is shown in Figure 1b (Anon, n.d.) whereas in fig. 1a we show the deposit stratigraphy in the city of Pompei along with the corresponding eruption units. Many of the victims brought to light by the archaeological excavations in the town of Pompei were found, either inside (40%) the houses whose roofs collapsed during the pumice accumulation and the strong ground shaking or inside and outside (60%) the houses, above the pumice fall, and within the deposit of the pyroclastic density currents that enveloped the city during the second phase of the eruption (Anon, 2003). The burial of entire cities and their rediscovery marked the birth of archeology (Figure 2). The information, that can be obtained on how the volcanic phenomenon impacted the roman town, and how the inhabitants managed to survive during the different steps of the tragedy inevitably depends on the archaeological excavation which, for obvious reasons, demolishes the geological outcrop (Figure 3). The great archaeological spectacle has always overshadowed the way in which both people and structures were impacted in the different moments of the eruption due to the lack of awareness in more distant centuries, the little attention in recent times, and the the lack of the contribution of other disciplines. Unraveling how the tragedy unfolded, has been considered marginal. The most complete works on the event remain those of a few volcanologists who were able to benefit from participation in the excavation, on outcrops that are no longer available. In this paper we try to derive, from few examples, some qualitative assessments of the impact of the eruption on buildings and people through archaeological reports and observation of images taken during excavations.There are also questions about some interventions which, if better documented, could have added important details about the eruption. 2 The products of the eruption of 79 CE. From below there are about 3 m of pumice, white at the base, gray from the middle of the layer, alternating upwards with flow products. The upper layer is formed by pyroclastic density current products. The generalized stratigraphic column of the eruption products [after (Cioni et al., 2000). Therefore, the first question that arises is: what remains in Pompeii of the eruption that buried it in 79 AD? The only remnants are those left by the first excavations, led since 1748 by generals of the Bourbon engineering corps, in times when there was no archeology and even less volcanology. Then, what was saved from the reconstructions of the 1800s and 1900s and the hasty restorations after the serious damage of the bombings in 1943. Of all the deposits that buried the city, the only left over are those that have not yet been excavated, but which are inexorably reducing (Anon, 2003)(Scandone et al., 2019). To get some observations on the products of the eruption while they were still intact, it was necessary to read the excavation notebooks, the oldest written in ancient Spanish, then gradually in an Italian that approached today's one. Fortunately, Giuseppe Fiorelli translated the excavation notebooks from 1748 to 1860 in the Pompeianarum Antiquitatum Historia, (PAH) (Anon, 1860). The reports are detailed on the findings, superficial on the description of the deposit, when it is noted, of course in relation with the knowledge of the time, even hasty on the number, position, and characteristics of the victims. In the midst of that quantity of precious finds, skeletons were rarely preserved, often thrown away with the resulting material (Figure 4). Some examples of early observation are given by the excavation of the \"Villa di Diomede\" (n. 1 in Figure 2), a building outside Porta Ercolano, unearthed between 1771 and 1774 under the guidance of the two Spanish brothers Francesco and Pietro La Vega. May 2, 1771 -\"two skeletons, the head of one is preserved, the one entirely with teeth\". December 11, 1772 -18 large human skeletons were found, one of a boy, and the other like milk infant(...) The shape of some bodies (in the ash), and in particular of a woman, was also found on this site, which were sent to the Museum, as still a skull with hair. The same news reported in the PAH (Giuseppe Fiorelli): December 12, 1772 -Eighteen skeletons, plus two others of children. Rain of ash with water, which seems to have run there. Footprints left in the ground. Hair and clothes of the aforementioned skeletons. And, again, William Hamilton (Anon, 1824)] -The female bust was in very fine ash \"a few feet above the floor\". From these phrases, extrapolated from long and detailed lists of findings, it is clear first of all, that among \"dos cabezas de hombre\" (from the notebook of Joachim de Alcubierre, the first director of the excavations), the archaeologists kept only the one with the teeth. It is noted that on a skull there were still hair, an unequivocal sign of the variation in the temperature of the flows from one place to another. In one place they could overwhelm and burn (in the garden of the same house they found on 17 August 1771, well-preserved carbonized trees), in another place just beyond, even the most fragile materials, such as hair and fabrics were preserved. The bodies that leave their mark in the fine ash, a prelude to the plaster casts that Fiorelli invented in 1863, indicate that they were above the pumice, even if it is not specified, (a layer a few feet high, could be 1-2 m) which acted as a filter for the slow decay of the soft parts of human body. The (fine) ash that covered them could not have been that of dense pyroclastic flows, formed by coarse pyroclasts and building material. In fact, not only does the \"rain of ash with water\" better reflect the characteristics of the deposits of expanded pyroclastic clouds, but the footprints remain clear only in a deposit composed by fine and homogeneous particle size, which mixes around the bodies, then hardens, while preserving footprint. The Villa di Diomede site is located in the area of Pompei closest to Herculaneum and, after the pumice fall, the first flows may have been the surges, expanded and fast, associated with the dense pyroclastic flows, slower and conditioned by the topography, which descended towards Herculaneum. The print of the nude female bust was so faithful and aroused such curiosity that a large number of visitors to the Portici Museum wanted to look at it and touch it, until it crumbled. Ashes were and ashes returned to be. The excavation notes give great prominence and accurate description of statues, precious objects, paintings; the bodies, the heaviest consequence of the eruption, receive attention only if accompanied by jewels or coins. Other examples about the Villa di Diomende, from PAH: 6 th February 1773 -Above the lapilli amongst the middle of the rain of ash, a skeleton was found (…) and close to the same, wrapped in a net, the following was found: Gold, and Silver (detailed list follows). In the same day, the notebook reports: a room (…) was found with a vault, which by being largely emptied was seen from a window, not yet being able to enter by the door. Vaulted structures are known to have resisted more than other kind of roofs and, in this case, in spite of the abundance of material in the dwelling that prevented opening the door. Direct testimony is important because it is not always easy to recognize them today, because of the reconstructions or the collapses that occurred after excavations. 13 th February 1773 -A skeleton of a man was found (…), and near to this skeleton 43 coins(…) These skeletons (…) after having escaped from the rain of lapilli, were surprised by the flood of ash. 20 th February 1773 -Two skeletons were found (on one hand) a silver ring (…). A short distance from these skeletons, a hand was found, (…) and joined to this was a ring of gold (…)-Two other skeletons have been discovered, and close to one of these there were 5 bronze coins. 28 th July 1774 -We have found (…) a skeleton with a silver ring on its finger, (…) and with a bronze arm bracelet, which has been sent to the Royal Museum together with a bone from the same arm, which was united to a mass of earth. Another attempt that comes close to the casts and another involuntary clue to the position of the body. Some terms used by the La Vega brothers would be incomprehensible without Fiorelli's translation in the PAH: February 1, 1773 -\"a skeleton was found among the rivegine, immediate to the rapillo\". According to Fiorelli, this is \"a skeleton on top of the lapillus, within the ash rain\". Therefore, it is another victim who, like the previous ones, can be included among those caused by the eruption phase following the fall of pumice (Figure 5). Giuseppe (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) is a legendary figure of Pompeian studies. In addition to the tribute due to him for the intuition that led him to make the plaster casts of the victims, his excavation notebooks are particularly accurate and scrupulous in the description of the archaeological findings. The data on the eruption are limited to some sporadic indication of the thickness of the volcanic products, however sufficient to make it clear which moment of the eruption it referred to: January 7, 1861 -in the atrium of House VIII,4,4 (House of Holconius Rufus; n. 2 in Figure 2) \"at the height of about 14 palms in the earth layer. Bone. (it is not specified whether human or not). In the same day and same house, \"A fragmented skull was found in the tablinum of house 4 on Via degli Olconii at a height of 10 palms\". February 30, 1861 -House of Cornelius Rufus (VIII,4,15; n. 3 in Figure 2) \"at the height of 10 palms, a fragmented human skull\". And, after many pages of detailed lists of objects, the last one to be named could be \"Bone. A human skull\". However, despite the lack of regard for human remains, the thickness of the products expressed in Neapolitan palms (0.2645 m) is repeated without substantial variations and roughly corresponds to the thickness of the pumice that fell on Pompeii, revealing that those skulls also belonged to people who died after the pumice fall. Amedeo Maiuri, the longest serving (just under forty years of service at the excavations, from 1923 to 1961) and most brilliant of the Superintendents of the past, unwittingly rendered many services to volcanology. His constant attempt to highlight the immense effort that the archaeological excavation had cost, both in Herculaneum and in Pompeii, his intuition towards an active museumization, which also involved the public, led him to innovative and useful solutions for the two disciplines . His efforts were always and exclusively aimed at archeology but, ultimately, they also benefited volcanology. But, also for Maiuri, the volcanic products, which he had swept away with the buldozers, were \"dirty snow Lisetta Giacomelli et al. to be bled\", (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.)] or \"a manure with excellent fertilizing soil\" (Anon, 1950). The scarce interest of archaeologists towards the eruption is also encountered in the work of today's researchers, with solid and well-deserved reputations in their field. Being impossible to avoid references to the volcanic phenomenon, they do not fail to demonstrate an embarrassed approach to the subject. The advent of photography (The first photographs were made by the French Alfred Nicolas Nomand in 1851) represented a step forward in documentation, although it is never as precise and complete as the direct observation of the products and the ascertainment of the damage caused by the different phenomena and processes. For example, without the images of the excavations made by Maiuri in the Orto dei Fuggiaschi (n. 4 in Figure 2), we would not know at what point of the stratigraphy, that is, at what moment of the eruption that group of people died. Some photos show the preparation of the casts and the victims are on a thin layer of pyroclastic flow products that covers the pumice. A doubt that arises when observing one of the casts on display is whether the products on which the head rests, as if asleep, are the same on which it was found. A photograph of the excavations confirms the position, with the head higher than the thin layer on which the other corps lie, perhaps due to an irregularity in the thickness of the flow at that point or an attempt to raise the head in the last moment of life, as is more evident in a neighboring victim (Figure 6). The excavation of the Orto dei Fuggiaschi farm is relatively recent and we have photographs from 1961 and 1972, when, after being freed of all traces of volcanic products, it returned to be the field it was the day before the eruption. In the excavation, in addition to the group of people, a triclinium and the alignments of crops, with irrigation furrows, came to light. Next to it, another agricultural area, Casa Stabiano (n. 5 in Figure 2) is an outcrop that should be safeguarded because it is the only one left inside the city, with the volcanic products of the first eruptive phase intact and the victims, the only ones, that still remain in the position in which they fell two millennia ago (Figure 7). The casts of Casa Stabiano were made in 1989 using, instead of plaster, cement, which both here and in the reconstruction of the buildings has not proved indestructible as was believed. The stratigraphic position of these victims, ten in all, is the same as that of the bodies in the nearby Orto dei Fuggiaschi, above a few cm of ashes which cover about three meters of pumice (Anon, 2018). On the bodies, the presence of tiles and some poles could suggest that they had taken refuge under a canopy. But this could not be the case, because the underlying pumice layer is undisturbed, so it fell directly to the ground (Figures 8 a,b,c). They were, therefore, certainly in an open place and the material torn from the buildings was dragged by the same flow that hit them. At the far side of the excavation, a skeleton remains, still incorporated in the products of the flow that has wavy structures that deviate at every small obstacle, climb over the same skeleton, while containing coarse building material transported in suspension. Here too it could be assumed a flow with different concentration of solids and with different transport capacity. How then the bodies can remain composed, with an attitude \"more similar to the one who sleeps\" (Pliny the Younger description of the corps of Pliny the Elder) than to a human overwhelmed by a high temperature flow, capable of breaking down even thick walls, remains to be understood (Figure 9). The 1914 photographs of the garden of the Casa del Criptoportico [AA. (Anon, n.d.)(Anon, n.d.) in Figure 2] are not very clear. You can see the windows of the cryptoporticus, through which, the people found in the garden, may have fled; a group of at least seven, from which three casts have been made. Under the bodies there is a thin layer of ash and below, down to the ancient ground, the thick layer of pumice. At the edges of the excavation, the products of the flows that covered them can be seen. The photographs of the excavations show in the ground of the garden a trace, possibly wheel grooves, but there are no indications that these were left on the day of the eruption or by carts used during the excavation. The garden of the Casa del Criptoportico reveals a lot, but it raises even more questions (Figure 10 a-b). The victims in the three sites (and many others found at the same stratigraphic level) are all outdoors and all in the same stratigraphic position suggesting that the survivors were compelled all at the same time to leave the relative safety of the houses where they survived the first phase of the eruption. Comparing Casa Stabiano with Casa del Criptoportico and Orto dei Fuggiaschi, a temporal picture of the moment in which many Pompeians tried to save themselves is available; that is, between the end of the first phase (pumice fall) and the beginning of the collapsing column phase, at least between 10 and 20 hours from the start of the eruption (Sigurdsson et al., 1985). Many evidences (and the comparison with explosive eruptions observed) suggest a temporal synchronism of the emission of the largest pyroclastic flows with the occurrence of strong earthquakes and that these were possibly the final cause of their departure from the houses on the point of crumbling (Anon, n.d.) (Figure 11). Inside the House of Painters at Work (n. 7 in Figure 2), a wall can be seen overturned over the thin layer of ash and the underlying pumice, exactly in the stratigraphic position in which the victims of the three previous sites are located. The same thing, overturning over the pumice, is witnessed in the scene of the large theater (Anon, 1998) \"knocked down by the flows\"]. Even the perimeter wall of the Palestra Grande facing Vesuvius seems to have been overturned by the arrival of the flows (Anon, 1998). (Figure 12) Lisetta Giacomelli et al. In the excavations of 2018-19, in the Casa di Orione (Anon, 2019)(Anon, n.d.) 2], the floor of the collapsed tablinum was found on an older floor. In the collapse hole there are white pumice (beginning of the eruption) mixed with gray pumice and then the ashes of the flows. It is not possible, with this data, to establish the precise moment of the collapse, but the lowering of the floor of a ground floor room, intended to contain furniture and people, would require a very high load. The pumices caused the slightly sloping roofs to collapse after 40 cm of accumulation (Anon, n.d.) but, where it happened, the beams and tiles are also found on the floor below, which apparently do not exist here. Perhaps the earthquakes contributed to the collapse of a floor that was believed to be unyielding. Another case where archeology should have been better integrated with volcanology is the excavation of the famous tomb of Porta Stabia (Press Release, Parco Archeologico di Pompei; n. 9 in Figure 2). We did not find any detailed works on the stratigraphy of the volcanic products removed and the site has long been inaccessible. In 2017, during the renovation of a building of the Superintendency, a tomb with a long and important epigraph came to light and, next to it, two deep traces of carts. The measurements coincide with those obtained from the tracks of the wagons on the paving of the roads, 7-8 cm wide, distant from each other just under a meter. The interpretation of archeologists is that they were carts of the Pompeians on the run. Indeed, in the excavations of 1889, some fugitives were found outside Porta Stabia, but without wagons. It would be comforting to know that in such a dramatic situation it was still possible to put carts over three meters of pumice and reach the outside of the city. If the depth of the furrow is due to the still very soft and deformable ash (even from a single cart), then one would expect to find also footprints, human or animal. Lisetta Giacomelli et al. Figure 8c The casts of the group of victims in the Casa Stabiano farm lie on a succession of flow products which, in the stratigraphy proposed by (Cioni et al., 1992) ends with E1 + E2 (= UE4) and are covered by ash with pisolites (F), still referable to UE4, in which are contained tiles and wooden beams. Lost Pompei Figure 12. On the right, the wall, with the window grating, overturned over the first layer of flow products that covers the pumice fall. Without a direct vision, made as the products were removed, and without precise data, every hypothesis is possible, but without scientific value. The doubt that the traces may have been left after the eruption arises from the fact that the clearing of the material is documented, in Fiorelli's excavation notebooks, for at least all the first three months of 1861 with many dozens of wagons directed to unload beyond Porta Stabia (Anon, 1873). All the maps of the areas excavated from 1800 to 1881 show the west and south sectors of the city, including the Porta Stabia area (figures 13 a, b). Furthermore, in the western sector, in the direction of the walls, traces of wagons used to free the buildings from eruptive materials, were recognized under the materials accumulated later, reported by Antonio Sogliano in (Anon, n.d.) (as mentioned by (Anon, 2015): the atrium was filled with earth and lapillus not in primary position (and) at about one meter above the original floor, the passage of wagons for the disposal of debris had to take place. (...) After this function, this passage was also obliterated). Many wagons used for clearing, up to and beyond the advent of wagons on rails, had the same characteristics as the ancient ones that have been reconstructed through the finds of the metal parts. Again, the photographs do not give answers, but serve to ask more questions. The excavation of the House of Iulius Polybius (n. 10 in Figure 2) is the only one in Pompeii, up to now, to be sufficiently documented, both by archaeologists and volcanologists (Figure 14). The clearing of the garden from the products of the eruption, which took place between 1964 and 1966, is perhaps the most recent intervention in the heart of the city. Although the building was completely freed from volcanic products and the bodies of the victims removed, volcanologists were able to consult extensive documentation, including photographic ones, and produce accurate works to trace the situation in the house during the eruption. The wall that closes the peristyle was found intact as it was spared by the collapse caused by the pyroclastic flows by the nearby building of the Casa dei Casti Amanti. The streams bypassed without demolishing it, leaving their traces on the plaster of the walls. The peristyle area was covered by about 5 m of pumice, more than the 3 m commonly found, because they also slipped from the pitch of the roof (Anon, n.d.) which therefore had to be sloping and not flat as they were later rebuilt. The victims, perhaps the entire family of Iulius Polybius, were found in the rooms at the bottom of the peristyle, that withstood the eruption, although they were on the side facing Vesuvius. The 1975 photographs show the position of the bodies, above 50 -60 cm of volcanic material, with a flask next to them to quench their thirst. Of the great explosive eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE in Pompeii there are very few traces of primary volcanic deposits left by archaeological excavations, both ancient and recent. In the first excavation notebooks, it is possible to trace some references that can integrate the knowledge of the deposits and the conditions of the city, as they were at the time of the discovery. The number of volcanology works, especially those contemporary to the archaeological excavation, the only moment in which the products can still be critically examined and studied, is inadequate to the importance of the event and its consequences on an inhabited area. The outcrops, once eliminated, do not allow any further revision, perhaps updated on the basis of new knowledge, nor debate with different opinions and skills. In the city, there is only one outcrop, albeit in very bad condition, Casa Stabiano, with the products of the eruption and the victims in their original position, which can be considered a rare find of volcanology. Excavated in the 1970s, as early as 2005 the ash was covered with grass, indicating how quickly volcanic ash can transform into soil. Among the inhabitants of Pompeii who had taken refuge in the most sheltered areas of their homes, many were pushed outside, at the same time for the threatening produced by a major, long-lasting earthquake that accompanied the collapse of the magma chamber (Scandone et al., 2019). Outdoors, they were then caught up and killed by pyroclastic flows. The most important fact is that many people were still alive after tens of hours of eruption and that, with appropriate knowledge and adequate organization, they could have saved even from the most violent explosive phases of the eruption, which could have important consequences for the Civil Protection plans. The only way to preserve the volcanological information for future investigation and understanding is leaving a few examples of outcrops within the city with their impact on edifices not totally excavated. The cast of humans and animals found in the ashes must be left in the places of their findings to better understand the timing and the causes of their deaths.",

Inoltre nel giorno di ieri lunedi sonosi ivi ancor trovali due altri frammenti di piedi, dei quali uno e semicolossale, dal metacarpo sino a tutte le dita, di uno stile delicato ed elegante, e l'altro di grandezza al naturale della meta sino a tutto il calcagno, anche di buona scoltura. Si sono gia date tutte le disposizioni, onde, terminato l'intiero sterro del tempio, s'incominci a togliere da esso tutti quei pezzi informi, che imbarazzano il luogo, e jar rimanere gli altri che appartengono all'edificio, per indi poterli riordinare per quanto sia possibile. (16. Jan.). II portico del cennato tempio e stato intieramente disterrato, e si e gia trovata /'aper/ura che immetleva nella cella, la quale si sta ora, come si e detto di sopra, con molta attiviia disterrando; e si comincia alfres? a scoprire il muro del suo lato destro, giacche il sinistro trovasi del lu/to sgombrato. (18. Jan.). Lo sterro della cella del tempio esastilo nel Foro e in buono stato, e forse nell'entrante seltimana sara interamente disotterrata..... Dippi\"u si sono rinvenuti alcuni frammenti di marmo bianco appartenenti ad una statua colossale, cioe due piedi con zoccoli, la di cui pianta e di lunghezza pal. 2 3/4. Un braccio, ed una mana (sic) distaccala con scettro. poi, verso le ore 23 d'Italia si rinvenne un busto coloss di marmo, senza testa, di allezza pal. 5 1/2, e di larghezza pal. 3 1/4, nella di cui parte di avanti rappresenta la figura di uomo, e nella parne di dietro vedesi ablozzata rusticamente una statua intera; dal che si congettura esser questo un pezzo di colosso inservibile, che gli antichi ne profittavano per alura statua piccola. Questa mattina nello stesso sito si e trovata una testa di alabasiro, anche colossale, di un Giove, di un bellissimo carattere [doubtless the well-known bust, inv. No. 6266, Guida Riusch, No. 939, MAU, Pompeii, ed. 2, Fig. 251, e con vari frammenti ad essa appartenenti. Di marmo: Una maschera colossale; una testa di donna di fatlura naturale, di bel carattere; una piccola testa di uomo, e diversi frammenti di mano, braccia, teste e toghe. (25. Jan.). Essendosi il giorno 21 terminato lo sterro della cella del tempio nel Foro,.,... (8. Feb.). Si . rimetlono al sig. catv. Arditi le tre teste di marmo [it is not clear which are meant, as in the meantime there had been discoveries of similar objects in the Macellum], con i frammenti che ad esse appartengono, assieme colla base ov'e incisa l'iscrizione [found in the celia of the Capitolium].

Vanie dita di bronzo, un picciol busto fisso al muro, una specie di scudo di quattro once e mezzo, moltissimi frammenti di ornati che sembrano essere appartenuti a delle cancellette forse di legname, un gruppo di un mezzo palmo di altezza, rappresentante un vecchio che tiene un ragazzo per la mano, ed una donna che porta il suo figluolino fralle braccia. Tanto sulla testa del vecchio che del giovinetlo si vede il cappello frigio: questo gruppo probabilmente era un'ex-voto. In marmo un mezzo piede, la porzione di una mano, e di un dito, una testa senile; due piedi rivestiti di sandali, un braccio, e molli frammenti tutti di colossale proporzione. Un torso di siffatta proporzione e di ottimo lacoro, sal dorso del quale si vede abbozzata intieramente una stataa. Altri frammenti di una statua, e di paneggio, una figura di donna di grandezza naturale..... The fragmentary character of the sculptural itolium is to be explained by the assumptio to the site by some of the survivors of the carrying away the metallic portions of the s which were made of wood '. In its present position, it is impossible pro and I refrain from attempting a descriptio ommended however that the Museum autho can be studied from all angles, and also arran the back. It is well known that the Forum of Pompeii was paved, about the beginning o first century A. D., with large blocks of limestone, well laid, and that at present, considerable portions of this pavement are preserved at the north and south e open space in the centre has been denuded except for a few isolated blocks pavement antedates the original construction of the limestone portico, which was i of construction in 63 A. D. and had been begun or at least was contemplated Tiberius 3; it is earlier than the bases of equestrian statues along the west side Forum, since these were constructed upon it; and it is earlier than some, but later 1 On acrolithic technique, see W.

The definitive treatment of the pavement of the Roman Forum is still to appear. 2. In the main Forum at Tarracina: C. L L., X, 6306, with the discussion in R. de la Blanchere, ';erra-cine, Paris, 1884 (vol. 34 of Biblioth'que des Ecoles francaises), pp. 122-132. Professor Frothingham's account of this pavement, in his popular book Roman Cities in Northern Italy and Dalmatia (London, 1910), contains an unfortunate lapsus memoriae: he quotes not the inscription actually upon the stones but a Pompeian inscription, C. 1. L.. X, 807. The A. Aemilius whose name appears on the pavement at Tarracina was not the architect, but the benefactor, as is shown by another inscription, C. 1. L., X, 6305. 3.

Here, by great good fortune, the bronze letters them-elves are preserved, not merely their matrices. The Augustan date of the structure in question may be accepted as tole by reason both of its peculiarities of construction and of its relation to ea monuments. A careful perusal however of Mau's writings will reveal t of the arguments (it is not a question of evidence) for considering th colossal statue of Augustus. Moreover, there are serious difficulties inheren In the first place must be advanced an objection on the score of hist ability. A glance at our Plate 25, Fig. 4 will show that if there ever w statue on the arched structure in question, the statue was a colossus so hug to dominate the Forum, and more than challenge comparison with the cult s in the Capitoline temple facing 3. It is inconceivable that Augustus would or that Tiberius would have tolerated, the erection of such a statue in Ital reigns: it was reserved for Nero and Domitian to assimilate themselves t outspoken a fashion. There is also the difficulty inherent in the fact that the structure discussing possesses, not the usual form of a statue base, colossal or otherw that of one type of ianus: the square form, which might be placed not but in a forum 4. I have no hesitation in proposing to identify the arched structure as sim 1 Cf. CURTIS, in Suppl. Papers Am. School of Cl. St. in (Anon, n.d.), note 1. 2 Ram. Mitth., Xi, 1896, pp. 153 f. 3 For a similar reason, I prefer to imagine, not a standing figure but a quadriga, on the large square base to the East, although as this dates from about the reign of Nero the objection is not so cogent. 4 On the ianus, see J. TOUrAIN, in DAREMBERG et SAGLIO, Dict. d. Ant., s. v. It must be admitted that the actual evidence for this signification of the ianus in Roman colonies is distinctly slighter than that for the Capitolium. The two types of ianus have not been hith-erto distinguished, I believe, with sufficient clearness. The resemblance of our monument to an arch rather than a base has naturally been felt by earlier writers, e. g. iii, (Anon, n.d.). These latter however are set at wider intervals, and have a greater breadth than depth; it is evident too from the vestiges in the wall that they served to support a wooden wardrobe, a portion of which is in fact represented by the cast which the excavators were able to make from the impression which it had left in the This hall of unusual plan has been explained either as a sloa poikile or as a market, and it has been suggested that grain or vegetables were sold there. The former of these two explanations is excluded by the consideration that the building is one of the few public edifices which were either begun or rebuilt from the ground after the earthquake of 63: it must therefore have been essential to. the public utility, not a purely decorative structure. Its orientation, with eight wide openings facing somewhat north of east, unfits it for a grain or vegetable market 3; while one would expect a hall for the sale of more valuable merchandise to be less exposed to the eyes and hands of the general public. And quite apart from this building Pompeii was well provided with markets and shops. I propose its identification as a school building, for which its location and plan would seem to adapt it admirably. Owing to its easterly exposure, it would be the warmest building on the Forum in the late mornings of Winter. We know that school was held in the Forum, from a Pompeian painting now in the Naples Museum, one of the series representing the life of the Forum 4, in which such a school is shown in operation. In the period immediately preceding the eruption, that is to say while our school building was in course of erection, school was held, apparently as a temiporary measure, in or near the edifice at the south-east corner of the Forum (E in plan), the I MAU, Pompeii, 2d ed., 87-89. The vaults have also been called a prison; of A. SOGLIANO, in N. S., 1900, 236-238; he concludes: Lasciando da parle qualsiasi congettura sulla destinazione cosi dei locali superiori come di quelli inferiori, trovo che la relazione da qualcuno ammessa fra i due piani dell'edificio non esiste per nulla, essendo l'un piano del tulto indipendente dall'altro. Mancando il rapporto topografico, viene necessariamente a mancare qualunque alUro rapporto. 2 It is visible in P1. 24. 3 Cf. VITRUVIUS, 1, iv, 2: Ideo eliam ea granaria, quae ad solis cursum spectant, bonitatem cito mutant, obsoniaque el poma, quae non in ea parle caeli ponuntur, quae est aversa a solis cursu, non diu servantur. He has in mind a southern or western exposure as especially undesirable for granaries etc.; but a vegetable market with easterly exposure would be at an equal disadvantage, as the vegetables would generally be brought in to the city and sold there in the morning. The identification as a grain market has been thought to find confirmation in the not far distant standard table of measures. But this dates in its original form from the Samnite period, and in its present adaptation from the earlier part of the reign of Augustus, and therefore has no connection with the structure urnder discussion; moreover, its purpose was not for use in connection with the actual transacting of business, but to serve for the standardizing of the merchants' measures. Before closing this article it is desirable to enter a word of caution wit the view held by some archaeologists as to the Pre-Roman Forum and the changes introduced in the plan by the Romans at the time that the colony was founded. As this theory involves a whole phase of the early history of Pompeii, it is necessary to quote it in some detail as it was developed by the late Abbe Thedenat 2: n Le Forum de Pompei occupa toujours une partie de l'emplacement oiu le voyons aujourd'hui. Ce fut d'abord une simple place entre quatre rues. On peut encore reconnaitre les limites de ce Forum primitif. La rue de l'Abondance et la rue della Marina, a ce temps4la, ne formaient qu'une seule voie qui, sans doute, etait la limite septentrionale de la place. A l'ouest, le Forum etait borne par une rue qui descend entre la basilique et le temple de Venus; au sud, par la rue qui passe devant la maison de Championnet et les Curies; a l'est, par la rue delle Scuole. Ces rues n'ont pas dQ changer car, parmi les maisons qui les bordent, il en est de tres anciennes. A la fois march& et Forum, la place etait plus longue que large; aussi, quand on construisit la basilique, c'est sur sa longueur qu'on prit le terrain necessaire. n Au li1 siecle avant notre ere, un questeur de Pompei, Vibius Popidius. fit regulariser la place et l'entoura d'un portique a deux etages..... \" Tel etait l'etat du Forum quand les Romains entrerent a Pompei. Ils y trouverent donc un forum grec. Pour qui connait les usages des Romains, il est evident que le forum grec ne devait longtemps survivre a l'installation des colons envoyes par Sylla..... Aussit8t la colonie etablie, les Romains s'occuperent donc de transformer en forum romain le forum grec des Samnites. La grande place rectangulaire fut jalonnee au milieu des rues et des maisons qui recouvraient l'emplacement qu'on lui destina; on y fit entrer le Forum samnite; le lieu choisi pour elever le temple de Jupiter occupait l'extremite opposee; de telle sorte que le forum romain ne fut qu'un prolongement vers le nord du forum grec '. This theory, however attractive it may appear in the French savant's presentation, nevertheless must be rejected: it is unnecessary, and it is at variance with the evidence. There is no need to assume any violent modification of the general plan of the Forum, in fact all the evidence points toward a fair degree of continuity. The colonnade of Popidius, which antedates the Roman colony, occupies all the South end and the southern part of the eastern side, and on the western side there are traces of it almost to the northern extremity. The discovery of remains of dwelling houses under the central space of the Basilica (I in plan Fig. 1) 3 shows that the earlier Forum did not extend much further to the West than the present one, at least in its southern portion; moreover 1 MAU, Pompeji, 2d ed., 115 f.
